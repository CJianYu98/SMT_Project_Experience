      Hong Kong food supplies may be disrupted as COVID-19 hits goods drivers: Authorities
  </h1>, 'text': 'HONG KONG: Hong Kong authorities said on Sunday (Feb 13) supplies of vegetables and chilled poultry into the global financial hub may be temporarily disrupted after some mainland goods vehicle drivers preliminarily tested positive for COVID-19.\nHong Kong imports 90 per cent of its food, with the mainland its most important source, especially for fresh food. Consumers have already seen a shortage of some foreign imported goods, including premium seafood, due to stringent flight restrictions.\n""The mainland authorities and the (Hong Kong) government are working closely together to firm up the detailed arrangements to expedite the logistics of food supply for Hong Kong so as to make the supply situation resumes normal as soon as possible,"" the government said in a statement.\nOn Saturday, the city of 7.5 million people reported a record 1,514 new coronavirus infections, up from Friday\'s 1,325, in the biggest test yet for the Chinese territory\'s ""dynamic zero-COVID"" strategy.\nAfter a meeting with mainland Chinese officials across the border in Shenzhen, Hong Kong\'s number two official, John Lee, said on Saturday that China will help the city to cope with the expanding outbreak by providing testing, treatment and quarantine capacity. He said there were no plans for a mainland-style lockdown for now.\nThe measures will give Hong Kong a breathing space as medical capacity becomes stretched on all fronts, although there were no specific details of the plans and it was not clear how quickly they could be implemented.\nHong Kong and mainland China are among few places in the world still aiming to suppress every COVID-19 outbreak, but the Omicron variant has proven tough to keep under control.\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\n', 'related_topics': ['     Hong Kong ', '     food ', '     COVID-19 ']}"

      Commentary: Losing weight after festive eating is not just about diet and exercise
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Before he joined our Weight Management Programme, Mr Yuen* successfully lost weight in the past. \nThe 37-year-old took time to cook healthy meals and set protected time for exercise daily. He seemed to be doing all the right things. \nHowever, after some weight loss at the start, his weight rebounded, gradually increased and peaked post-Chinese New Year – and he did not even know why and when it started. \nIt is not uncommon to see patients who lose track of their weight. They know what good weight management is but can’t keep the pounds off. This is why knowing the “hardware” of weight loss (in terms of a meal plans and an exercise regime) is essential but insufficient. \nWhat we also need is the “software” - the skills that help us effectively apply the “hardware”. And to be aware of what behaviours need changing and how to keep track, problem-solve and find a more sustainable solution in the long run. \nUsing these so-called psychological interventions in managing weight is not new.\nThe Health Promotion Board-Ministry Of Health Clinical Practice Guidelines set in 2016 state that weight loss programmes should incorporate psychological intervention, namely cognitive-behavioural interventions. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) is a form of psychological treatment that identifies and changes the unhelpful thoughts underlying the feelings and behaviours that work against you.\nIn the US, the American Psychological Association also highlighted in articles published in 2013 and 2020 that a major aspect of weight control involves understanding and managing thoughts and behaviours that can interfere with weight loss. \nFor example, one may think that rejecting food will upset the person offering it or feel\xa0the need to clean off the plate\xa0in order not to upset a well-meaning friend who happens to be a great chef who cooked up a delicious meal. Most of us would encounter these incidents, but not everyone can manage such thoughts in a way that do not derail our weight loss efforts. \nA systematic review of the effectiveness of psychological intervention for weight management, published in Cochrane Database Systematic Review in 2005, revealed that people who were overweight or obese benefitted from psychological intervention that targeted behavioural change. \nFor instance, they worked on how people used food to cope with stress or boredom. Or simply felt they deserved a good meal because they worked hard.\nBy working on our general attitudes towards food, made people more aware of what was stopping them from losing weight.\nDuring the festive seasons, these behavioural responses can kick into higher gear. With more socialising, it is common to think there’s simply no time or energy to exercise. Others may go the other way – and say, it’s once a year, let me let go and eat whatever I feel like. \nTo be sure, there are also those who think celebratory meals will derail their plans and refuse to attend gatherings or eat at all. Naturally, none of these approaches are ideal because they tap into an all-or-nothing mindset.\nKeeping one’s weight down is a long-drawn process requiring consistency and flexibility. We need to balance different needs from the different aspects of our lives.\nFor those still struggling with weight issues, my view is everyone needs to start with a plan. While some people succeed in losing weight based on some “off-the-rack” weight loss plans they learnt from the Internet or friends around them, many find it difficult to follow through and eventually give up. \nThis is because different people have different needs, resources and constraints. No one plan fits all, so customising an effective weight loss plan for yourself will make your weight management easier and improve the odds of success.\xa0 \xa0\nSetting a target that is within your means, deciding when and how to go about achieving it is critical. For example, instead of saying, “I will snack less”, tell yourself you will only eat five pineapple tarts in one sitting. \nA goal needs to be realistic. Extreme goals usually backfire because they are hard to execute and maintain, yet we will not maximise our potential for weight loss if the goal is too easy - like if\xa0we set the goal to only walk additional 100 steps a day.\xa0 \nExperts suggest that examining our current eating and exercise habits and making goals that are challenging, but not too far from the baselines work better. Often, it helps to sit down with a healthcare professional and work out what are current eating habits and how much exercise we do – just this chat alone can unpack some of the areas that need work.\nLosing weight should be no different from any task you set yourself to do. Think about a deadline or project at work. If you know what you need to do, you will start tracking your progress, ensuring you meet the deadline. \nSimilarly, evaluating goals and reviewing progress regularly for weight management is vital. People veer off track easily when there is no self-monitoring – no planning or reviewing mechanism, for instance, not weighing regularly, no recording of diet (includes all meals and snacks) or physical activity level, no pre-empting of changes in their daily routine such as during festivals that don’t go well with their current weight management plans; no regular review of plans to check if there are any red-flags. \nThese result in us being unaware of the need to get back on track, until our clothes feel tighter, or when we belatedly weigh ourselves in the clinic.\nIn Mr Yuen’s case, setting the extreme goal of preparing every meal on a daily basis was too time-consuming and labour-intensive.\xa0 \nAs he did not set a timeline to resume the weight management routine and did not develop a habit of reviewing his weight loss progress regularly, he put on weight gradually. Consequently, he felt demoralised when he noticed that his weight increased and avoided regularly weighing altogether. The longer he avoided that, the harder it was for him to get back on track.\xa0 \nSince then however, he has modified his goals and worked them around important celebrations that gave him joy. On some days, he pre-arranged visits between meal times so that he could have his healthy meals before heading out. \nHe also became more aware of his thoughts and to change the all-or-nothing mindset, to enjoy CNY in moderation and remind himself that weekly weighing would not take much time and was part of his approach to keeping his weight down. \nFestive seasons are one of the common pitfalls of weight management plans. But if we are aware of how we think and feel about food and the rationalisations we make to get out of doing something better for our bodies, the better our outcomes will be.\nWhen we complement the “hardware” with the “software” tools of weight management it will mean we can still savour delicious pineapple tarts without tipping the weighing scales. \nMabel Yum Po Shan is Head and Principal Clinical Psychologist of Psychology Service at the Khoo Teck Puat Hospital.\n*Pseudonyms were used in this commentary.\n', 'related_topics': ['     weight loss ', '     food ', '     Diet ', '     exercise ']}"

      Student budgets may be tested by Cup Noodle price hike in Japan
  </h1>, 'text': 'TOKYO: Student budgets in Japan may come under pressure after Cup Noodle, a cheap meal long associated with late night study sessions, became the latest target of price rises in the land of its birth.\nThe one-two punch of global commodity inflation and a weak yen have spurred a wave of price rises among Japanese consumer staple makers, who have more often relied on ""shrinkflation"" - or smaller portion sizes - to pass rising costs onto their price-sensitive customers.\nNissin Foods Holdings\xa0on Thursday (Feb 3) said it was raising the price of its signature Cup Noodle to 214 yen (US$1.86) per regular package, up from 193 yen, effective from June - the first such increase in three years.\nCup Noodle was a 1971 fast-food innovation consisting of dry noodles, soup powder and ingredients such as vegetables or meat in a disposable cup that hurried consumers - students included - can prepare just by adding hot water.\nCup Noodle rapidly became a hit round the world and remains the No\xa01 brand of instant noodles in Japan, spokesman Kazuki Tsurumaru said.\nWith costs rising for transportation, wheat and wrapping materials, Nissin was left with no choice if it wanted to retain the brand value of its 50-year-old bestseller, Tsurumaru said, adding that Nissin has never shrunk the package size.\n""Cup Noodle is a product with a certain set volume,"" he said.\n""It wouldn\'t be good for us to cut that, so that customers said \'Hey, there isn\'t so much shrimp,\' or \'The noodles have decreased\' or \'The flavour\'s thin.\' That\'s a stance we at Nissin just fundamentally will not take.""\nNissin also announced 5 per cent to 12 per cent price rises elsewhere in its instant food lineup, ranging from ramen to udon to tofu soup, targeting 70 per cent of the company\'s around 270 products.\nNissin is not alone, with the price of beef bowls, margarine, scissors and many other everyday items going up recently as well.\nLast month, the company making popular corn puff snack Umaibo jolted the country by raising its price from 10 yen to 12 yen a piece. It was the first hike since Umaibo\'s debut in 1979.\nBut Japanese noodle buyers can still consider themselves lucky.

      Trust, listen, don’t play the blame game: Fluff Bakery founders’ recipe for a healthy marriage and thriving business
  </h1>, 'text': 'Cake lovers will remember the days when queues at Jalan Pisang – so long they would creep along the narrow five-footway and spill out into the back alleys in the Arab quarter – were a common sight.\nThis was when Fluff Bakery was merely a hole in the wall, albeit one that sold cupcakes in Singapore so creamy and with such unique flavours that instead of leaving you feeling guilty, gave you a sense of achievement.\nFast-forward nearly 10 years and not only is Fluff Bakery still around (a rare feat considering the local F&B turnover rate), it’s as popular as ever, with bakes constantly selling out online and at the shop. In fact, the business levelled up last year, moving out of its Jalan Pisang space into a much bigger one along North Bridge Road.\xa0\nThe cult bakery is the brainchild of Ashraf Alami, 41, and Nursyazanna Syaira Mohammad Suhimi (Syaira), 35, who married just a year before opening their shop at Jalan Pisang. \xa0\nIn the first of CNA Women’s Valentine’s Day series about couples in business, we find out what it takes to maintain cult status in a famously cutthroat industry and above all, how this couple fights fires together at work and still come back to a happy home.\xa0\nYOU STARTED FLUFF BAKERY IN 2012\xa0WHEN YOU WERE STILL DATING. TELL US ABOUT THAT.\xa0\xa0\nSyaira: It started in June that year with me just selling cupcakes out of my mum’s kitchen to raise money for our wedding expenses. Ashraf was a private tutor and I was working in public relations. There were no other halal bakeries at the time that offered cupcakes with fillings and when we started, none whatsoever with local flavours. The demand started to get crazy and it made more sense for me to focus on it full-time.\xa0\xa0\nAshraf: I would pick Syaira up from work, we’d have a quick dinner out and head back to her mum’s kitchen where she would bake the cupcakes. I would help where I could although I would say my skills in the kitchen were quite limited. The hours were punishing and we would frequently finish up around 2am.\xa0\nWe opened an Instagram account to promote the bakes and as customers posted good reviews of the cupcakes and tagged us, our following grew quickly and so did the volume of orders. We were baking 60 cupcakes a day and at one point we were fully booked for three months. It was then that we found a cafe called Penny University to supply the cupcakes to and as demand continued to pick up, we decided to quit our jobs and focus solely on the business.\xa0\nAt that time, we were selling 300 cupcakes a day at the cafe and it would sell out in two to three hours. We ran the numbers and decided that it made sense to open up our own retail store, hire more staff and ramp up production. (The couple opened their first physical store in 2013.)\nAt our peak, which was in 2015, we were selling 1,800 cupcakes a day. Our revenue that year was S$1.6 million and we were only selling cupcakes at the time.\xa0\nTHAT\'S A LOT OF CAKE. BEFORE WE GET INTO THAT, WHAT ROLE DOES EACH PERSON PLAY, AT WORK AND AT HOME?\nAshraf: Syaira is the typical messy creative. She does a lot of experimenting in our kitchen at home and comes up with lots of activities for our son, Noah (Noah is often seen on Syaira’s Instagram page helping his mum with the cooking and baking). I’m more task-oriented and also quite a clean freak. At home, I do the tidying up and manage our expenses.\xa0\nSyaira: I’m the food and ideas person in the business so I’m in charge of the menu and product development. I’m hopeless at numbers and the business side of things so Ashraf does that because he is good at numbers! We both discuss business direction and development.\xa0\nAt home, it’s about the same – we pick up the things we’re good at. I handle the busiest part of the home, the kitchen. This includes all our meals. Ashraf handles the finances and gets the important things done such as paying the house bills.\xa0\nLET\'S GO BACK TO GROWING THE BUSINESS. FLUFF BAKERY BECAME A BIT OF AN OVERNIGHT SENSATION. WHAT WAS THAT LIKE?\xa0\xa0\nSyaira: At the start, we were both struggling with just getting used to running a business instead of being a home-based one. There were so many things that blurred into our individual roles, such as staff management.\xa0\nThere were many instances that we had a strong opinion on something that was in the other person’s “domain”. I think it’s important to know what you’re good and not good at, to listen and know that the other person is not trying to “correct” you but just has the business’ best interest at heart, and respect the strengths the other person has. We rely on each other to make it work.\nFor example, Ashraf wanted us to have more stores both in Singapore and around Southeast Asia but I would rather be just one small artisanal store and focus on being a local must-go destination for good bakes. When the opportunity to open a store in KL presented itself in 2017, I was initially hesitant but after listening to Ashraf’s points I agreed that maybe it was time to spread our wings and give it a shot.\xa0\nAfter two years of opening one in KL we both decided that it was better to close it down and focus on our flagship in Singapore. The most important thing was that we listened to each other\xa0and we tried, and learnt so much from it.\n""STRONG OPINIONS"" ARE INEVITABLE. TELL US MORE ABOUT HOW YOU HANDLE CONFLICT AS A MARRIED COUPLE IN BUSINESS TOGETHER.\nAshraf: When you are married and run a business together, it can be hard to leave the work part to strictly business hours. We frequently find ourselves discussing work-related issues at home, which can be quite exhausting so now we try to remind each other to keep work talk at work.\nSyaira: It’s easy to say that work is work and personal life is separate but when you work and live together 24/7, things do blur into each other. There were times where we would disagree at home about personal matters and you do get hurt emotionally and it does affect how you interact with your other half at work and during work discussions to a certain degree. That is part and parcel of working together and I don’t think it’s realistic to say you can compartmentalise work and personal life.\xa0\xa0\nWE\'RE GUESSING YOU\'VE HAD TO SET GUIDELINES TO ENSURE YOU HAVE A HEALTHY WORKING RELATIONSHIP. WHAT ARE THEY?\xa0\xa0\nAshraf: We have clear guidelines on what each person is supposed to be responsible for in the business and trust that the person is handling it the best they can.\xa0\nWe don’t always see eye to eye when it comes to the business and that can lead to a lot of conflict, so we decided that we each will give our input but ultimately the person in charge of that part of the business has the final say. When one person messes up, we don’t play the blame game. We know they feel bad so we just focus on how to solve it together.\xa0\nAlso when people are too familiar with each other, we form impressions of the other person. For example, I know Syaira is not good with numbers so I tend to dismiss her opinions on business strategy but I find when I keep an open mind and listen to what she has to say, she comes up with some really good ideas. The key is to learn to trust each other and be open to the other person’s ideas.\nWHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED ABOUT EACH OTHER ON THIS JOURNEY?\xa0\xa0\nSyaira: That we’re both not as on-the-ball as we’d like to be and really depend on our team at Fluff (the bakery has 18 other full-time employees) to help us along.\xa0\nI’ve also learned that when Ashraf gives feedback, it can seem like he’s attacking me personally but he actually genuinely cares about what is best for the business and that it’s not a personal attack on my craft. I’ve learned that I can be quite sensitive in that sense.\xa0\nAshraf: I learned that while it’s true Syaira is terrible with numbers, she has a keen sense of business and some of the best business decisions we’ve made were her suggestions.\nWhen we first launched, our biggest competitor was charging S$3.50 per cupcake. I was in favour of charging the same but Syaira wanted to charge S$4 because she believed that we had a superior product due to our fillings. We stuck with S$4 and sold out daily for two years.\nSyaira is also very “gung-ho” – she believes in “do first, worry about the consequences later” while I’m more cautious and tend to over-analyse the situation.\nIT\'S BEEN NEARLY A DECADE AND FLUFF BAKERY CONTINUES TO SELL OUT. WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO MAINTAIN A BRAND WITH A CULT FOLLOWING?\xa0\xa0\nSyaira: Firstly, we have to constantly change and innovate to keep up with the game. The F&B scene is constantly improving every day with newer and younger entrepreneurs who are awesome at what they do. I have to keep learning new techniques, and offer new and exciting things to make sure we are always considered as a destination bakery.\nSecondly, we can’t do everything ourselves. Fluff is not just Ashraf and I but really, everyone there. Fluff is made up of the manager, the kitchen team, the counter “elves”, the back-end operations, the admin and technical aspects, the dishwashers and the delivery drivers that (deal with the areas) we don’t have expertise in or time to devote ourselves to. The people are really important to me personally so we try to show our appreciation for the team when we can.\nWhen we can’t afford to do big gestures, we do try to show small forms of appreciation, such as treating them to lunch and a massage every month. (The couple shared that they also commit to sharing 10 per cent of their yearly profit with their staff and gave them a two-month bonus in 2020.)\nAshraf: It’s also important to be authentic. We don’t sell anything that we personally don’t like to eat and we only sell products that we feel are as good if not better than our competitors’.\xa0\nSyaira: My favourite item on our menu has got to be anything with our lemon meringue in it, especially the lemon meringue tart! It’s so simple but I feel ours is one of the best. The lemon curd is lip-puckeringly sour – as it should be – and everything else balances it out.\nAT THIS STAGE OF YOUR MARRIAGE, WHAT DOES LOVE MEAN TO YOU? HOW DO YOU THINK YOUR VIEWS ON LOVE HAVE EVOLVED?\xa0\xa0\nSyaira: Growing up, you see in the media that love is all about the big gestures … the big proposal, the big presents… but after nine years and a kid, I’ve really come to see that love is in the everyday small things – the little acts of service that the other person appreciates.\nFor me, that’s Ashraf loading and unloading the dishwasher at home when I’m too busy or too tired, it’s him sharing the load of the daily ins and outs of parenthood, that’s him just listening – or pretending to –\xa0while I ramble on about the latest baking or cooking obsession that I have even though he’s not even 1 per cent interested in what I’m saying. It’s him making my daily life easier by making sure that I have all that I need to create a harmonious family environment at home. Showing up and sharing the load – that’s love. I show my love in the food that I cook, and by spending hours in the kitchen for a family dinner.\xa0\nWe also know each other’s love language. Mine is physical touch and acts of service so when he makes the effort to stroke my back to comfort me or just reach out for my hand, sometimes on a really hard day, that’s all it takes to feel loved.\xa0\nAshraf: I agree. After nine years of marriage it’s no longer about the big grand gestures. To me it’s the small everyday things that matter. We discovered the five love languages in our second year of marriage and that was a game-changer. While we used to express love and how we want to receive it, we now understand what our partner responds to.\xa0\nTo me, love now is about mutual respect and partnership, supporting each other through good and bad times. Love is stepping in to help do things you might not like when your partner is struggling.\xa0\nAlso, love used to be about spending quality time together but now it’s about taking the kid out for a couple of hours so your other half can have some quality time.\xa0\nWHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON GENDER ROLES AT HOME AND AT WORK, AND HOW DO THESE APPLY IN YOUR LIFE?\xa0\xa0\nAshraf: I don’t believe there are specific things men and women are supposed to perform. Men can and should be equally capable of taking care of a child, cooking and doing house chores. I believe roles should be divided equally, with each person taking on roles that they are better at or enjoy more.\xa0\nSyaira: Yes, we pick up roles at home according to what we feel we can contribute to the marriage and family. I love cooking – I don’t feel forced to do it because I’m a woman. Ashraf cooks as well – he does a good steak! Everyone belongs in the kitchen – the kitchen has food.\xa0\nOh and I don’t do most of the household chores. Ashraf does the chores, like the laundry and cleaning up.

She started with the usual air-fryer specialties, frozen pizza rolls and tater tots.\nBut it wasn’t long until she realised that her model could make pretty much anything she wanted.\nFour months later, she was stunned when her homemade cheesecake emerged from the device, baked to perfection in 20 minutes with no cracks or dips.\n“Then, the floodgates opened,” Abbott said. She thought, what more could she cook in the air fryer?\nLamb chops, beef and pork tenderloin, a medium-well rib-eye steak, filet mignon, crab legs, lobster tails, pecan and pumpkin pie\xa0– she has made them all in the appliance she calls her “magic box”. She now owns seven, six of different brands, and runs a blog, Air Frying Foodie, with her friend Jennifer West.\nThe two are also moderators for a Facebook group, Easy Air Fryer Recipes, where users share dozens of recipes and tips for the device. The group has nearly 1 million members, with about 10,000 new requests to join every day.\nCooks stuck at home during the two years of the pandemic have turned to the air fryer, in part, because it can replicate deep-frying, lending crunch to foods while using little or no oil. But they have also discovered that it can do more than just crisp. An air fryer can make breakfast, lunch and dinner.\nFor some cooks, it has nearly replaced ovens or microwaves for heating frozen finger foods, refreshing leftovers or cooking meals and desserts. Social media influencers, especially on TikTok, have made careers out of sharing new recipes and unexpected uses for the appliance.\nFans have tapped into the old habits of a fry cook, air-frying anything they get hold of and hoping it works. You name it, someone has probably stuck it into an air fryer\xa0– cooked penne for “pasta chips” or whole, shelled eggs for a soft or boiled texture.\nFarrah Jalanbo, a food influencer in Chino Hills, California, came up with an elote-inspired recipe for corn ribs that became an air-fryer favourite. Her version\xa0– corn on the cob that has been quartered, air-fried and dressed with Cotija cheese and cilantro\xa0– has drawn more than 14 million views on TikTok, where there are dozens of corn-rib adaptations, from sweet to spicy to barbecue-seasoned.\n“Any air-fryer recipe does really well because people love seeing different ways of using that extra kitchen appliance they paid for,” Jalanbo said.\nFred van der Weij, an inventor in the Netherlands, was just looking for a way to crisp a French fry without deep-frying when he started developing the air fryer in 2005.\nBefore his invention, he said, alternative methods for making fries at home took too long, with disappointing results. A convection oven, for instance, dried them out.\nIt took van der Weij three years to develop a prototype, and his egg-shaped fryer, produced by Philips, was introduced in 2010 at the Internationale Funkausstellung, a major consumer electronics fair in Berlin.\nIt combined close-range radiation and increased air flow to better heat the food’s surface. Philips now owns the patents for van der Weij’s air-frying technology.\n“It was kind of a holy grail that many companies were looking for – to make better French fries,” he said. “To find a way to make the handling much easier and the results much better would be a very big potential, that was clear. But I did not expect it would be as big as it is right now.”\nMajor kitchen-appliance companies like Cosori, Ninja, Cuisinart and Instant Brands quickly introduced models of their own. They have added the air-fryer function to other appliances like convection and home ovens and pressure cookers.\nWhen West, the co-creator of the Easy Air Fryer Recipes group on Facebook, set out to remodel her home kitchen in Shreveport, Louisiana, she decided that a stove with an air fryer was a must, even though she already owned five models of the air fryer.\n“It’s a great device used by everyone,” she said of the air fryer. “All ages, all over the world.”\nThe air fryer is closely following the path of the 12-button blender, said Ruth Cowan, a retired history of science professor at the University of Pennsylvania and the author of a book on household technology titled More Work For Mother.\nAs air fryers become a counter staple, manufacturers are adding features to fry, bake, dehydrate, pressure-cook or broil. And as consumers shop for an air fryer, they often choose one with many functions, Cowan said, even though they’ll probably use only a few.\nThe popularity of the air fryer also reminds her of the microwave’s ascendance in the 1970s. Some companies thought home cooks would use the microwave only to heat frozen meals, but ultimately they found other uses.\n“Nobody recommended cooking a whole chicken in a microwave,” she said, “but people did.”\nYield: 3 to 4 servings\nTotal time: 25 minutes, plus resting\nIngredients:\n550g chicken wings, cut in half through the joint into wingettes and drumettes\n1 1/4 teaspoons baking powder\n3/4 teaspoon kosher salt\n1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper\n1 tablespoon melted unsalted butter\n1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest\n1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice\n1/2 teaspoon honey, preferably dark\n1/2 teaspoon Tabasco sauce\n1/4 teaspoon sriracha or other chilli sauce\nPreparation:\n1. In large bowl, toss chicken with baking powder, salt and pepper until thoroughly coated.\nSpread chicken pieces out on rack placed on a rimmed baking sheet and refrigerate, uncovered, for at least 1 hour and up to overnight. (The longer, the better.)\n2. Heat air fryer to 400 degrees, if preheating is necessary.\n3. Arrange chicken on air fryer rack so all the pieces are standing up against the edges of the basket, with as much space around each one as possible. Fry until golden brown and crispy, about 20 minutes.\n4. Meanwhile, in another large bowl, whisk together butter, lemon zest and juice, honey, Tabasco and sriracha.\n5. Immediately transfer fried chicken wings to bowl with the honey-chilli sauce and toss well. Serve at once.\nThe appliance has been an especially useful tool for Shelly Cobb of Arab, Alabama, who has experienced pain since having knee replacement surgery, and struggles to move around her kitchen. It is much easier for her to reach her air fryer on the counter than to bend over to use her oven, an appliance she has almost retired.\nShe uses the air fryer to bake light, airy biscuits for breakfast. Leftover pizza reheated in the fryer comes out better than it did in the oven, she said.\nThe air fryer, she said, is “everything and better than I hoped it would be”, adding that with her medical issues, “it’s made it bearable to cook”.\nSocial media influencers have ratcheted up the creativity of recipes made in the air fryer by showing off the device to younger audiences.\nOn TikTok, a video app most popular for users 16 to 24 years old, content creators have banked millions of views by pushing the limits of what can be made in the air fryer\xa0– everything from those corn cobs to doughnuts and cookies.\nCurrently, there are 2.6 billion views under #airfryer and another nearly 700 million under #airfryerrecipes.\nYield: 2 servings\nTotal time: 25 minutes, plus soaking and drying\nIngredients:\n1 large russet potato (about 230g), cut into 0.5cm-thick sticks\n1 1/2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil\n1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, more as needed\n1/4 cup mayonnaise\n2 tablespoons sour cream or plain whole-milk Greek yoghurt\n1 tablespoon Dijon mustard\n1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika\nPreparation:\n1. Put potatoes in a large bowl and cover with cold water. Soak for at least 30 minutes (or overnight in the refrigerator), then drain and pat very dry.\n2. Heat air fryer to 350 degrees, if preheating is necessary. Line a rimmed baking sheet with paper towels.\n3. In a dry bowl, toss potatoes with 1 tablespoon oil and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt. Transfer to air fryer and fry at 350 degrees for 10 minutes, tossing halfway.\nTransfer potatoes to baking sheet, spreading them in an even layer. Let them cool to room temperature, at least 30 minutes and up to 4 hours. (This optional step gives fries a slightly crispier exterior. If you want to skip it, keep potatoes in the fryer and proceed to the next step.)\n4. Turn air fryer heat up to 400 degrees. Arrange potatoes in fryer if you’ve taken them out, and drizzle with 1/2 tablespoon oil.\nCook until golden and crisp, about 8 to 10 minutes, tossing or stirring halfway through. Transfer immediately to a serving platter and sprinkle with more salt.\n5. While fries are cooking, make sauce. In a small bowl, stir together mayonnaise, sour cream, mustard and paprika. Serve alongside fries for dipping.\nJori Maglaya, a chef and DJ in Los Angeles, who goes by the name Jori Mezuda, has attracted thousands of comments on TikTok videos in which she makes air-fried foods like cheese sticks dusted in spicy Cheetos. “People are like, ‘Oh my gosh, you make me want to buy an air fryer’,” she said.\nFood companies have piggybacked on the appliance’s popularity. Since 2019, many Ore-Ida products have come with air-frying instructions. Tyson items like chicken nuggets and strips have similar directions, and the company is selling premade air-fried chicken. Louisiana Fish Fry makes coating mixes specifically for the air fryer.\nHow long the love affair will last is unclear. Electric knives and fondue pots have had their day on the kitchen counter, said Cowan. But in most homes, they were eventually exiled to the back of a cabinet or discarded.\nFor Chinyerem Uguru, a New York blogger who uses the name Chichi, it’s the oven that is getting a rest. She has used it only a handful of times in the past six months.\nNo need to use the stove to make easy-to-peel hard-boiled eggs, or the oven to make small quantities of her native Nigerian food like jollof rice or meat pies. The air fryer, she said, is “here to stay for the long haul”.\nBy Christina Morales © 2022 The New York Times.

      Commentary: What’s behind empty supermarket shelves in the US and could it happen here?
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Two years into the pandemic and it’s starting to feel like deja vu for consumers in the United States and many other countries as they are again confronted by empty shelves at grocery stores. \nThe Omicron variant has highlighted continuing vulnerabilities countries face collectively in keeping goods stocked. \nBut the supply chain issues experienced now are not exactly the same as those in the early days of the COVID-19 crisis.\nIndeed, this particularly contagious nature of the Omicron variant and its rapid spread created a perfect storm for supermarkets. But much of the problem comes down to trying to move goods with insufficient labour, rather than the shortage of goods seen earlier in the pandemic. \nFrom mid-December until today, the virus has taken workers out of commission at all levels of the supply chain: From workers at ports unloading imported goods and those working in warehouses, to truck drivers moving the goods cross-country, to those stocking store shelves and working check-out lines. \xa0\nIn some sectors, production has been disrupted as well by rising COVID-19 cases that have sidelined staff. Meat shortages, for example, arise from problems at meat packing plants where there is lower slaughter capacity and not enough inspectors to certify the meat.\nVaccine uptake, particularly the low numbers, may also exacerbate the problem. \nWhile Omicron has shown an ability to evade immunity provided by vaccines or past infection, being vaccinated and boosted with the mRNA vaccines used in the US does confer some form of protection against the strain. \nWith the highly politicised nature of the vaccine, vaccination rates in the US lag behind wealthy peer countries. \nWorryingly, the lowest rates are found among workers in the sectors that deal with foodstuff and consumer goods: Agriculture (49 per cent vaccinated), F&B (61 per cent), retail (64 per cent), manufacturing (64 per cent) and transportation (64 per cent), according to a market research firm Morning Consult poll.\nThe current wave of Omicron cases comes amid an underlying pandemic-induced labour shortage associated with what is known as the “Great Resignation Wave”. \nWorkers in frontline fields like grocery stores, restaurants and retail who have had to cope with low wages, poor benefits and often badly-behaved customers are quitting in hopes of finding less stressful and better compensated jobs. \nThe US Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that in November 2021, a record number of Americans, 4.5 million people, quit their jobs, which amounts to 4 per cent of the workforce. \nEmployment in the transportation sector appears to be holding steady but trucking was one field that saw large-scale resignations early in the pandemic, losing 6 per cent of drivers.\nConsumer demand has also shifted as a result of life during a pandemic. The emergence of Omicron means that people are eating more meals at home. \nThe tentative movement towards returning to the office has been slowed as people remain at home because they are sick, isolating because of exposure, unable to find test kits to determine whether they are sick, or simply staying put trying not to get infected. Restaurant dining has also taken a hit. \nMore home-cooked meals have increased demand for supermarket food at a time when supply chains are already under pressure.\nFinally, the weather has played a role in the shortages we currently see. Harsh winter storm weather, particularly across the Midwest and Northeast US, has not only caused delivery delays of goods, but also pushed consumers towards panic-buying as they try to stock up on essentials. \nBeyond normal, \xa0seasonal weather issues, some analysts point to climate change and the increasing frequency and severity of storms as wreaking havoc with supply chains.\nThe US is not the only part of the world facing Omicron-related supply chain difficulties. Australians are seeing similar shortages in supermarkets as the virus has spread rapidly through the workforce.\nMost of Australia’s food and agriculture products are for the export market to Asia, so some knock-on effects are expected across the Asia Pacific.\nHong Kong in particular is bracing for some short supply. In addition to the supply chain issues everyone is facing, the city imports most of its food and is pursuing a “zero COVID” policy. \nFlights into the city have been dramatically cut with a resulting steep decline in cargo space. Fewer imports coming during the Lunar New Year peak period demand all but guarantee some bare shelves. \nLike Hong Kong, Singapore imports 90 per cent of the food it consumes. However, the city state may face fewer problems of food shortage as government policy since the beginning of the pandemic has been to protect the resiliency of the supply chain. \nIt has worked closely with Malaysia, the largest food exporter to Singapore, and other ASEAN nations to ensure a flow of goods while also, as researchers have highlighted, releasing food from its strategic stockpile and increasing local production by investing in industries like vertical farming.\nStill, many industry analysts see the severe shortage problem around the world as temporary with the potential for small, sporadic disruptions. \nThe fast-moving Omicron variant appears to peak quickly and mean relatively mild illness for those who are vaccinated. There is a sense that by March, Omicron will have spent itself and supply chains will decongest. Yet that may be an overly optimistic assessment.\nThe World Health Organization has pointed out how new waves of the virus are likely, particularly because low vaccination rates worldwide give it the opportunity to mutate in unknown ways.\nOne key to solving this lies in vaccinations. It is imperative that the global inequities in vaccine availability are addressed, with rich countries making more of an effort to ensure supplies to emerging nations. \nIn the longer term, the development of a universal coronavirus vaccine could obviate the need for constant vaccination campaigns. \nGiven the vaccine hesitancy that has taken hold in many parts of the world, policymakers may still face challenges hitting population vaccination targets. \nThe current disruptions have also shown that jobs for those in the supply chain need to improve. Better working conditions, not just higher salaries, would allow workers to be better protected from the virus and to recover from it without loss of income, helping to retain employees critical to ensuring that goods are available.\nLooking somewhat farther ahead, greater automation and, in some cases localisation, in the supply chain, particularly with some thought to mitigating the likely effects of climate change in coming decades, may help reduce the frequency with which consumers face the prospect of empty shelves.\nTrisha Craig is Vice President (Engagement) and Senior Lecturer of Social Sciences (Global Affairs) at Yale-NUS College.

      'All 2,000 cucumbers died': Shortage of vegetables, durians from Johor as crops destroyed by floods and heat
  </h1>, 'text': 'JOHOR BAHRU: Farmer Naviin Thiagarajan plans the planting of his crops based on an understanding of decades-long established weather patterns in Malaysia.\xa0\nThe 28-year-old, who works on a 2 ha land near Kota Tinggi with his 54-year-old father, rotates between planting long beans, okra and cucumbers across the rainy and hot seasons.\xa0\nHowever, Mr Thiagarajan said that these once-reliable plans are in disarray as the weather has recently become more extreme and erratic.\xa0\n“From last year (2021) onwards, we started to see how unpredictable the weather has become. And over the last month, the weather has truly epitomised what I have read about climate change,” he told CNA.\xa0\nAt the start of the new year, many parts of the southern state of Johor saw torrential downpour, leading to floods that displaced thousands of residents.\xa0\nThe floods also hit many farms, destroying crops and impacting the livelihoods of many in the industry.\nHowever, what has perplexed many farmers is how this period of intense and heavy rain has been followed by warmer\xa0weather in the last two to three weeks, with lower rainfall across the state.\nBetween Dec 26 and Jan 1, at the height of the Johor floods, data released by the Johor Department of Irrigation and Drainage showed that the city of Johor Bahru had 1,448mm of rainfall, according to Malaysian media reports.\xa0\nIn comparison, Johor Bahru recorded 515.3mm of rainfall between Jan 1 and Jan 27, according to estimates on\xa0weather.com\nThe average maximum temperature in the area was 30.6 degrees Celsius between Dec\xa026 and Jan 1. This edged up to 31.8 degrees Celsius between Jan 1 and Jan 27.\nThe period between November and March is synonymous with the northeast monsoon, which usually leads to heavy rain in many areas of peninsular Malaysia. Hence the recent spate of warm weather has caught many farmers by surprise.\xa0\n“The floods have of course destroyed many crops,” said Mr Thiagarajan.\xa0\n“But the last two weeks of no rain and high temperatures have been just as bad. I planted 2,000 cucumbers and all of them died because of the heat,” he added.\xa0\nMr Thiagarajan explained that some of his okra and long beans died from excessive rain in late December. But he maintained that this pales in comparison to the losses sustained due to the warmer and drier\xa0weather in January.\xa0\nHe estimates that he may have lost around 10,000kg of cucumber due to the warm weather, with a financial loss of around RM8,000 (US$1,909).\xa0\nHe is not alone. Other farmers in Johor have echoed similar sentiments. They told CNA that erratic weather between late December and early January has led to produce shortages at an inopportune time, amid rising demand for fruits and vegetables ahead of Chinese New Year next week.\xa0\nMr Mad Zin Abdullah, who owns a durian plantation in Kampung Tengah in Segamat, told CNA that his crop yield in December was “washed away” by the flood water which infected the roots of many of his trees.\xa0\nSegamat was among the worst-hit areas when floods hit Johor in early January.\xa0\n“The floodwater was this high,” said Mr Mad Zin pointing to his chest.\xa0\n“I had some suppliers asking (for durians) but there was none available to sell,” he recounted.\xa0\nThe veteran farmer, who is in his 70s, told CNA that the prolonged hot weather which followed the floods has dried up most of his plantation. However, this does not necessarily mean that the conditions are now conducive for growth.\xa0\n“There was no balance between moisture in the soil and the right temperature. We will have to wait to see if there will be more durians in a few months,” he added.\xa0\nChairman for the Yong Peng vegetable farmers’ association Cheng Tai Hoe told CNA that the floods had destroyed around 30 per cent of the crops in farms in affected areas across Tangkak and Segamat.\xa0\nHe added that the floods, followed by prolonged hot weather, has further curtailed the growth of produce ahead of Chinese New Year. Examples include cucumber and bitter gourd.\xa0\n“When it rained, the roots were impacted by fungus in the soil … Quickly followed by prolonged hot weather, many seedlings will wither and die,” said Mr Chen.\xa0\nMr Chen added that many farmers in Johor have been unable to overcome this shortage. As a result, the prices of fresh produce have gone up, including those sold at local markets and exported to Singapore.\xa0\n“We are operating based on demand and supply in the market economy. Because many farmers are unable to meet this shortage, prices will be high. Only those who can afford it will be able to pay for some of these vegetables,” he added.\nEnvironmentalist Renard Siew told CNA that what these farmers in Johor are experiencing is in line with the report released by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) last August.\xa0\nThe report stated that climate change was intensifying the water cycle, bringing about more intense rainfall and associated flooding. It added that climate change could also lead to more intense drought in many regions.\xa0\nDr Siew, who is the climate change advisor to the Centre for Governance and Political Studies (Cent-GPS), a Malaysia-based behavioural and social science research firm, said that the erratic weather patterns in Johor quite clearly reflects the climate change phenomenon.\xa0\nHe said: “Farmers were hit with a double-whammy effect. Their crops will be hit by severe floods followed immediately by long periods of drought.”\nOne aspect of the phenomenon, he said, is how floods will wash away the crops. Additionally, every 1 degree Celsius increase in the earth’s temperature will lead to a 2 per cent to 3 per cent decline for the yield of key agricultural produce, he noted.\xa0\nSome farmers are beginning to recognise the growing challenges. Mr Thiagarajan, who has been reading up on the impact of climate change on agriculture, said he finds it difficult to adapt to erratic changes in weather patterns.\xa0\n“Climate change is real so we have to adapt and try to move forward and work around it. My dad and I always look at the weather report and try to plan ahead,” he said.\xa0\nHowever, many of the farmers in the state are still unfamiliar with the concept of climate change.\xa0\nWhen asked by CNA if the recent decline in crop yield may have been caused by erratic weather linked to climate change, durian farmer Mr Mad Zin said he was unsure.\xa0\n“I’ve done this since the 1970s and there have been floods before. But we ride through it again and again,” he stated.\nDr Siew said the dialogue on climate change in Malaysia needs to encompass all communities, inducing rural farmers who may be directly impacted.\xa0\n“Conversations around probability, likelihoods and severities, for the layperson it may be difficult to digest. There is something to be said to the need of gaining awareness of climate change to the rural people as well,” he added.\nTo help farmers cope with these erratic changes in weather, Dr Siew said that the authorities should educate the public about a need to build agricultural resilience.\xa0\nHe explained that this can be done by using technology for precision agriculture. This means using precise parameters of soil acidity, water and sunlight to maximise crop yield.\xa0\nHe added that the concept of vertical farming may also be introduced. This involves using warehouses and greenhouses instead of open land which are exposed to the elements.\xa0\nKota Tinggi farmer Mr Thiagarajan also expressed hope that either state or federal authorities would extend help to farmers whose livelihoods will be impacted in the future.\xa0\n“We need help with resources and advice. If only the agricultural department could help directly in advising us how to do crop set up, maintenance, amid the challenges of climate change. It will be a great help for many farmers,” he added.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Malaysia ', '     Johor ', '     climate change ', '     food ']}"

      Commentary: Inflation and rising prices worsen Malaysia's flooding woes
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The rising prices of daily necessities in Malaysia have led to rising levels of mercury in the country’s online space.\nIn the second half of November 2021, inflation became a hot topic on Malaysian social media. Netizens took to social media to complain about the rising costs of daily necessities such as poultry and vegetables.\nThe online chatter provides some insights not only about Malaysians’ grievances about the increasing prices, but more crucially, their dissatisfaction with the Government’s handling of the situation.\nThere was a spike in the number of mentions about inflation from Nov 23 to 27, 2021. This was partly due to government and news reports about the exponential rise in prices of daily necessities.\nFor example, on Twitter, Malaysian newspaper Harian Metro published an infographic summarising the increases in vegetable prices. The tweet received thousands of retweets, where many bemoaned the government’s handling of prices of food staples. \nTwitter netizens brought up another important issue regarding inflation – wages were not increasing in tandem with inflation.\nMany pointed out that wages have been kept low for many years while the cost of living has steadily increased. The top tweets about inflation with the most engagements (retweets, likes, and replies) including one by Bernama’s Faizal Hassan, received 18,000 retweets which lamented the issue of wages.\nMany emphasised that wages, especially the minimum wage, have been low for the past few years. Two of the most common phrases mentioned when discussing rising prices were “minimum salary” and “rate gaji” (wage rates).\nTo its credit, the Government sought to engage with netizens on the issue. The Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) is the main body entrusted with ensuring that prices are kept reasonable for consumers.\nSince Nov 22, 2021, it has made many posts about the issue. Several posts urged consumers to shop smarter, such as by using the KPDNHEP’s mobile application that allows users to compare prices between shops.\nThe ministry’s posts also sought to clarify the extent of inflation and to fact-check viral posts, such as those that claimed that the price of vegetables had tripled. However, these ministry’s social media posts were met with a lot of flak. \nOn Twitter, many users retweeted tweets describing KPDNHEP’s social media posts as a form of “clownery” and called the KPDNHEP a “waste” of government resources.\nAnother one of the most popular phrases retweeted was “not y’all gaslighting”, which referred to a tweet about how the KPDNHEP has shifted the blame onto the rakyat for the rising costs of goods.\nThe netizen pointed out how a KPDNHEP infographic blamed shop owners’ greed and monopolisation for the increase in prices. This is untrue because there were many testimonies by shopkeepers and other authorities that cited reasons like poor weather and an increase in the cost of production for the price hike.\nNetizens also trained their ire on politicians’ handling of the situation. For example, Prime Minister Ismail Sabri made several Facebook posts addressing inflation, only to be countered with criticisms of his government.\nAccording to shop owners as well as the authorities, the root causes for the price hike were external factors such as the increase in prices for imported fertilisers, petrol, and environmental factors like constant bad weather.\nSuch factors affected the prices of vegetables and poultries, many of which are domestically produced (Figure 4). Hence, controlling prices is not a straightforward issue. The prices of domestically produced goods rose because the prices of their imported inputs had become costlier (and are not easily controllable by the government).\nMeanwhile, Malaysia had in 2020 imported around RM55.5 billion (US$13.3 billion) of food like chilli and mutton as well as commodities like cooking oil. These products experienced a price hike from overseas producers and hence limits much of the KPDNHEP’s ability to control their prices effectively.\nIn the interim, the government has come up with several short-term solutions to tackle the price hike such as importing 200 container loads of chicken and stopping fish exports. Such a solution aims to temporarily increase the supply of food to reduce scarcity, therefore helping to establish some control over the prices.\nNonetheless, these solutions are only short-term in nature because they do not tackle the root causes of the price hikes.\nDespite the government’s efforts to respond to the situation, it has little online approval of its handling of inflation and problems associated with the rising costs of living. It could be said that the Government failed on two counts: To communicate the deeper causes behind the price hikes, and coming up with policies to either rein in price hikes or tackle the issue of stagnating wages.\nWhile the former is not entirely in the Government’s control, they have failed to address the latter, which is in fact within their control.\nMuch of the attention that the rakyat, media\xa0and authorities gave to inflation has now been diverted towards the floods which have ravaged several parts of Malaysia since Dec 16, 2021.\nWhile it is a different issue, the social media posts exhibit similar sentiments, where netizens flayed the government for its slow and inadequate flood response. The floods have added another line of attack for netizens to criticise Putrajaya’s handling of inflation.\nAmirul Adli Rosli is a Research Officer at the Regional Social and Cultural Studies Programme at the ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute.

      Golden Chef brings ocean treasures to your Chinese New Year gourmet gatherings
  </h1>, 'text': ""The Chinese believe that if you eat well during Chinese New Year, you’ll eat well the entire year. It’s more than just serving up delicacies we rarely indulge in; they need to be auspicious in symbolism as well. \xa0\xa0\nThat is why abalone features on most Chinese New Year menus. Known for its unique texture and plump ocean flavour, the mollusk’s name in Mandarin sounds very much like “guaranteed surplus”. For a celebratory table, it’s a decadent gift from the host to the guests. For a reunion meal, it’s a blessing to all present.\nGolden Chef has been FairPrice’s top-selling abalone brand for four consecutive years since 2018 and for good reason.

The Golden Chef Australian Baby Abalone 6-10s (S$49.80; 425g; drained weight 140g) is another star product, now available in a pack size that’s newly launched for this year’s festivities. Harvested from the cool waters off the Southern coast of Australia, the premium-grade packed live abalone boasts\xa0an equally succulent, if more subtle, flavour.\n\nOut to make an impression with a culinary gift? Get the Golden Chef Elegance Gift Set (S$108.80) that comprises the Australian Baby Abalone 6 to 10s, South Korean Baby Abalone 8s (420g; drained weight 150g) and South African Baby Abalone 3s (425g; drained weight 80g). The trio of goodies is packed in a powder-blue gift box with peony prints, redesigned for 2022, and housed in a Golden Chef festive bag for a complete presentation. Until Feb 16, the first 2,500 customers who use their OCBC credit/debit cards will enjoy S$5 off Golden Chef’s gift sets.\n\nAnother bestseller for Chinese New Year is the Golden Chef Chile Razor Clams (S$8; 425g; drained weight 150g). Ideal for hotpots, stir-fries and cold dishes, the clams boast a chewy texture and mild flavour. They are also free of trans fat, low in fat and high in protein. You can check the bottom of the can to see the size of the clams: Golden Chef’s clams are listed as Size 2 and 3, with 2 being the larger.\nThis transparency of what goes into its cans extends to Golden Chef’s other products. It is one of the first brands in Singapore to indicate the drained weight of its canned seafood so you know exactly what, and how much, you’re buying. It also displays the source country and the quantity (for abalone). As Golden Chef’s range grows to include more than 15 types of canned seafood, the source countries have expanded to encompass South Korea, South Africa and Taiwan as well.\nA DASH OF DELICIOUSNESS\n\nIn 2018, Golden Chef expanded its portfolio to include condiments, helping time-strapped home chefs add a dose of flavour to their dishes easily.\nLaunched this year, the Golden Chef Premium Light Soy Sauce and Dark Soy Sauce are made from non-GMO soya beans and wheat. They are trans fat-free and naturally cholesterol-free, and will add a touch of savoury to your marinades, stir-fries, stews and braises.\nThe Golden Chef Premium Oyster Sauce with Dried Scallop, proudly made in Singapore, has up to 25 per cent less sodium than regular brands and no MSG added, so you can enjoy more of the ocean’s umami flavour in every mouthful. Both sauces are also halal-certified.\nTo liven up your hotpot meal, try the Golden Chef Japanese dressings, available in Roasted Sesame and Sesame Soy, as flavourful dipping sauces. The dressings are sourced, produced and packed in Japan.\nAnd professional chefs approve: Golden Chef’s ambassador, celebrity chef Eric Teo, lists the Roasted Sesame Dressing as one of his favourite Golden Chef offerings. “It’s so versatile with Golden Chef’s canned abalones and clams,” said the affable chef, who has presided over events such as F1 Grand Prix and MasterChef Asia.\nAnother essential condiment for Chef Eric is the Golden Chef Abalone Sauce. “It’s my go-to one-stop sauce for any Chinese New Year recipe,” he shared.\n\nChef Eric also endorses the extra dimension that Golden Chef’s quality ingredients add when creating dishes.\n“While I like all Golden Chef abalones because of the consistent premium quality, not all abalones are suitable in some preparation,” he explained. “For example, when preparing yu sheng, it's best to use wild abalones so that you can slice them according to the thickness you like. As for the baby abalones, I prefer to cook them with braised mushrooms, broccoli, fish maw, sea cucumber and even in soups.”\nSo, if you’re looking to prepare something exceptional this festive season to pamper yourself or your guests, Golden Chef’s catalogue of quality offerings should feature at the top of your shopping list.\nServe up an enriching feast with Golden Chef, available exclusively at FairPrice outlets and at FairPrice Online.\n\xa0\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Golden Chef ', '     Chinese New Year ', '     abalone ', '     food ']}"

      Commentary: Ordering in festive feasts can be stressful so why do people still turn to food delivery apps? 
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: How people get their food has changed dramatically during the past years, accelerated by the stay-at-home economy. The food-delivery ecosystem has become an integral part of life in Singapore.\xa0\nAccording to a survey commissioned by Deliveroo, 80 per cent of the 1,000 respondents surveyed here said they were ordering from food deliveries more than ever before, with half admitting that they order in food more than once a week.\nIt’s little wonder why. With social distancing guidelines halving most restaurants’ seating capacity and pandemic FOGO (fear of going out), many have opted for holiday meals at home. \nYet F&B outlets and platforms typically experience a spike\xa0in demand during the festive season, which strains their supply chains.\nOn Dec 24, 2021, a long wait for pre-ordered deliveries and takeaways from Collin's Grille outlets was reported across Singapore, with some waiting for up to three hours to no avail. \nOrders from Morganfield's also saw a two-to-four-hour delay on Christmas Eve in 2020. \nCommonly cited causes include running out of stock, a kitchen’s inability to cope with the large volume of orders or a lack of delivery drivers\nWhile some restaurants have learnt from past years and have steadied their supply chains, delivery platforms still struggle to match an overzealous demand for their services with delivery drivers sometimes.\nThe reality is that many platforms and restaurants are equipped to handle a regular volume of orders for dinner and lunches, but less so for the surge during large festive feasts, especially if half the nation turns celebrates the festival during the same days. \nYet, with all these incidents and risks, why do people still turn to food deliveries during festive seasons?\nThe phenomenon of turning to outsourced food services when hosting parties at home dates back beyond the proliferation of food delivery apps. For special occasions like birthdays, festivities and celebrations, people would engage caterers \nFor casual gatherings, many turn to fast-food outlets like 4Fingers, which can churn large quantities of food out quickly. \nHence, it is not surprising people look to delivery for their festive ordering. Empowered by delivery apps and the digitalisation movement, people now have a wider variety of choices to select from. \nYet there is one clear difference from the past: Not all options are equipped to accept large orders, which comes with risks churning out food from satellite kitchens and working with new partners for the first time.\xa0Delays and failures in fulfillment may cause distress, frustration and potentially a loss of trust.\nA few mishaps notwithstanding, food delivery services have been around for decades and will continue to do so due to several factors.\nWorking from home is great - yet the more time you spend at home, the more inertia keeps you from leaving the house. \nOur psychological inertia resists change unless compelled by a strong enough motive. We default to an easy option, even if there is a better choice available. \nThe thought of having to get ready to head out to eat or self-collect orders – which involves juggling a great number of takeaway boxes, and getting caught in the massive festive traffic with everyone else – can cause people to feel anxious. \nThis perceived cost of effortful behaviour encourages the pursuit of self-indulgent pleasure and immediate gratification. Passing the stressful responsibilities of getting food to the deliverers so you can eat in the comforts of home can seem like a really good idea. \nPeople also tend\xa0to view their past experiences through rosy glasses overall - remembering more pleasant than unpleasant events, and recalling events more favourably than they actually were - or what we call the positive bias in memory. \nWe might have encountered unreliable deliveries a couple of times, yet such memories tend to fade rather quickly, especially since people would probably have used the same service to order a meal for themselves the next day without hiccups.\nWith these constant success stories, people will simply assume that “if it works yesterday, it should work today too”, but fail to re-evaluate a situation even in the face of change.\nPeople also tend to unrealistically underestimate their personal chances of encountering negative events - what psychology terms optimism bias.\nSuch cognitive bias is common\xa0for both positive events (such as believing you might win the lottery and buying a ticket) and negative events (such as predicting you might experience a delay in food delivery). \nIn fact, research has found that people show more optimistic bias when in a positive mood. With upbeat jingles playing everywhere as shops celebrate the Chinese New Year, people are slipping into happy holiday vibes and tend not to focus on the risks of events taking a sour turn. \nThat nice feeling of believing that things will work out on an individual level and a potentially false belief in having more control over things than we actually do are wafting through the festive season.\nUnfortunately, just like believing we’re each a better-than-average driver more skilled at manoeuvering our vehicle at dangerously high speeds, our biased estimates on the probability of negative events happening could lead to potentially risky decisions. We might host a festive party and relying solely on an untested F&B outlet on a rarely used food platform, both of which can be unreliable and without a human interface at the other end to troubleshoot and carry out service recovery immediately.\nStill, we can’t live life without taking sensible risks.\xa0When disaster strikes with our food deliveries today, people do have a straightforward route to recovery today.\nThe convenience of food delivery platforms and the number of such available services mean that if one order lets you down, several others may save the day within an hour or two, especially if delays are caused by a specific restaurant. \nIn situations where the food delivery platform is responsible for the delay, turning to other platforms or restaurants with their own delivery fleet such as fast food joints can save the day. \xa0\nApart from Grab, Foodpanda and Deliveroo,\xa0options include OddleEats, which feature popular restaurants such as Astons.\nCompare that to years back, where caterers who failed to turn up meant that the host had to grab a few people to run to the nearest restaurant or fast-food outlet in person to save the day.\nAs long as a new batch of food arrives, the disgruntlement will slowly fade once hunger among the guests is resolved.\nThere’s little doubt eating habits are changing. Even for regular meals, a recent Singapore Management University 2021 survey showed a significant year-on-year increase in take-aways.\nPeople may prefer to host celebrations at home as they do not need to worry about the commuting time and the crowd in F&B outlets on festive dates. \nWhile they might have to tolerate glitches and considerably steep service fees, that is something they are getting used to. There is nothing like focusing on the more important part of special occasions: The people around us. \nWhile food platform services will continue to experience the occasional gaps in reliability, people will still turn to them with the pros clearly outweighing the cons. Hence, expect the Chinese New Year orders to continue. \nChong Guan is Associate Professor in Marketing and Deputy Director at the Office of Graduate Studies, Singapore University of Social Sciences.\nSean Lee is Associate Faculty at the School of Business, Singapore University of Social Sciences and Senior Consultant at Consulting Division, Kantar\n"", 'related_topics': ['     food delivery ', '     Grab ', '     Foodpanda ', '     Deliveroo ', '     holiday ', '     food ']}"

      7 home bakers on Instagram to buy CNY goodies from: Pineapple tarts, kueh lapis and more
  </h1>, 'text': 'Celebrating Chinese New Year is all about food, family and more food. You know the drill: Order your favourite CNY snacks early so you can get ahead of everyone else (in case the goodies sell out, which has happened). Here are the women who are whipping up delectable bakes from their home kitchens.\n1. BELINDA SIN OF BELLABAKES\nAll it took was one bite of her aunt’s almond cookies as a child, for Belinda Sin to become curious about baking – and eventually fall in love with it. “I was so fascinated by how simple ingredients could turn into something so tasty.”\nBut it was only after her kids got older that the mum of three, who works full-time at a bank, found more time to bake.\n“In my early years as a small home baker, I mainly focused on cakes with fondant decoration, such as flowers and figurines,” said Sin, who started her home bakery in 2009 and only bakes during her free time.\xa0\nOver the years, she has expanded her offerings to include chocolate truffles, sourdough bread, walnut brownies and others.\xa0\nHer Chinese New Year specialities: Almond cookies (S$22 a bottle) and Tigger chocolate butter cookies (S$23 a bottle). To order, fill out the form here or reach her on Instagram.\n2. CHUA YAN LING OF THE COOKIESMITH\xa0\nChua Yan Ling, 26, started her side hustle in January 2020 with monthly bake sales, usually on the second or third Sunday of the month.\xa0\nShe started with flavoured butter cookies (there’s Nutella, Oreo, Biscoff and toffee nut), and went on to include cakes such as matcha pound cake, pandan chiffon cake, burnt cheesecake and more.\n“Knowing that others are enjoying my bakes keeps me going despite my busy work life,” said Chua, who works full-time as an auditor. She most recently included a “bakebox” for the Christmas season, giving customers a compilation of her specialities.\nChua even inspired her mum to start selling her pork floss rolls on The CookieSmith. “I am very proud of my mum for many things – and making nice pork floss rolls is one of them,” she said.\nHer Chinese New Year specialities: Cranberry macadamia cookies (S$20 a bottle) and her mum’s pork floss rolls (S$20 a bottle). Her menu also includes Nutella, cheese, Earl Grey, scallion and Biscoff “burger” butter cookies. While her orders for Jan 16 and 23 are already full, there are still slots for Jan 30 here.\xa0\n3. MELANIE TANG FROM SEA AND THE CAKE\nWay before her home-based business started, Melanie Tang, 33, was already baking cookies for friends and family during Chinese New Year, which were always met with glowing reviews.\nIt was only in August 2020 that Tang, who works full-time in the TV industry, decided to start selling brioche via Instagram – just a few months after learning how to bake bread during Singapore’s circuit breaker.\nWe like that she’s creative and offers unique flavours. When it comes to her periodic bake sales, which have no fixed menu, she told CNA Women that she first decides on a base item, then tests, experiments with and perfects the recipe (and presentation) for sale.\xa0\xa0\nFor instance, Tang put her own spin on the usual plain butter cookies, experimenting with different tea combinations such as Oolong (which didn’t work as the scent was too mild) before settling on Earl Grey.\n“I’ve been tempted many times to sell “trendy” items, but I decided against it because I didn’t want to follow trends,” she said.\xa0\nHer Chinese New Year specialities: TWG Earl Grey butter cookies topped with strawberry jam, and two-tone chocolate butter cookies at S$19 a bottle. We also like her gift set option (S$38) comprising both Earl Grey and chocolate cookies, and comes with two complimentary oranges – perfect for house visits. Reach her on Instagram to order for Jan 19.\n4. EVANGELINE YEW FROM KUEH FOR YEW\nEvangeline Yew, 59, who works in insurance, has always enjoyed food and baking, especially Peranakan food.\n“My grandmother and my aunt are my main influences when it comes to home cooking and baking. Through their food, I was inspired to learn to make the dishes and sweet treats on my own,” she said, adding that her kueh salat and kueh lapis were inspired by her aunt.\xa0\nA Peranakan herself, she offers nyonya kueh such as kueh salat, kueh dadar, kueh kosui, pulut inti (glutinous rice topped with coconut) and orh kueh (steamed yam cake).\nWith the help and encouragement of her daughters, aged 21, 29 and 34, the mother of four started selling her kueh on Instagram in 2020. Her daughters helped her set up the account,\xa0as well as help with branding.\xa0\xa0\nHer Chinese New Year specialities: With the exception of kueh bangkit, orders are now closed for Chinese New Year but on Feb 4, Yew will begin taking new orders for her kueh bangkit (S$20 a bottle), kueh lapis (S$65 for a seven-inch square) and other kuehs such as kueh dadar ($25 for 25 pieces) and kueh salat (S$50 for a seven-inch square). Bookings have to be made three days in advance. Order here.\n5. NORZILA ALIAS FROM ANA’S ARTISANAL BAKE\nIt was a spontaneous decision for Norzila Alias, 49, to join her niece on a bake sale in July 2020 to sell her brownies.\nTwo weeks later, the mother of five started an Instagram account for Ana’s Artisanal Bake. “Prior to it, I’d been looking for a permanent part-time job as my kids are in school, but to no avail,” she said. Norzila was previously a freelance designer and crafter. Her youngest is nine, and her eldest is 20.\xa0\nShe told CNA Women that setting up a home bakery was a “steep learning curve”. “I wasn’t really aware of the home-based business scene at that time as I’ve never ordered any cakes or food via Instagram before,” she said.\xa0\xa0\nThe good news is orders started to trickle in via word-of-mouth and she managed to gain a steady flow of customers, including corporate orders. These were enough for Norzila to turn Ana’s Artisanal Bake into a full-time gig in January last year.\nHer Chinese New Year specialities: The Opulence Box (S$34.50), which comprises an orange butter cake with caramelised oranges, naked chocolate cake and black cocoa sable cookies. You can also order her cookies in a large bottle: Black cocoa (S$20), hazelnut (S$22) and sesame (S$20). Order through her Instagram page.\xa0\n6. ANGELA FONG FROM HOMEBAKEDBYAF\xa0\nWorking full-time in the retail industry, it never crossed Angela Fong’s mind to sell her baked goods – she would bake in her free time and give them out to family and friends. But the good reviews she received motivated her to start posting her bakes online to see if there was any interest.\nThere was, and in 2017, the 34-year-old started selling her bakes online during the various festive seasons: Log cakes and sticky date bundt cakes for Christmas, mooncakes during the Mid-Autumn Festival, and cookies during Chinese New Year.\nFong told CNA Women that she used to offer a wide menu but decided to reduce the variety to focus on quality. “Last time, I had bak kwa cookies, florentine cookies, cornflakes cookies, butter cookies and more,” she said. Now, she’s focusing on her bestsellers, such as pineapple tarts and ondeh ondeh tarts.\nHer Chinese New Year specialities: Ondeh ondeh tarts (S$22.80 a bottle), pineapple tarts (S$23.80 a bottle) and walnut cookies (S$18.80 a bottle). You can order via Instagram or Facebook. \xa0\n7. ALIX YEO AND ANGEL NG FROM SUGAREDFLOUR\nWhen she was 18, Alix Yeo wanted to start a cookie business as she was inspired by the Instagram bakers she found. “I thought that it looked really fun and interesting to own a business, so I told my mum, and from there, sugaredflour came about,” said the 20-year-old polytechnic student.\nThe mum and daughter started their home baking business via Instagram in 2020, cementing what mum Angel Ng, was already doing, selling chiffon cakes on an ad-hoc basis since 2014. The 46-year-old has a full-time job in human resources.\xa0\nThe duo started with a cornflakes brownie and expanded their menu to include their bestselling pulut hitam sponge cake, and others like burnt cheesecake and doughnuts.\xa0\xa0\nTheir Chinese New Year specialities: Pineapple tarts (S$19 for 380 grams). Other offerings include the almond (S$14 for 210 grams), butterscotch ($15 for 210 grams) and bubble chocolate (S$14 for 190 grams) cookies.

      Amid rising costs, Singapore government aims to maintain wage growth and diversify food imports: Low Yen Ling
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: With prices rising on multiple fronts, the Government is striving to maintain wage growth and diversify food imports to lessen the impact of inflation, said Minister of State for Trade and Industry Low Yen Ling on Tuesday (Jan 11).\nShe was responding to questions from Members of Parliament Ang Wei Neng (PAP-West Coast) and Jessica Tan (PAP-East Coast) about what can be done to manage the impact on consumers.\nSingapore’s core inflation rose\xa0to 1.6 per cent\xa0year-on-year in November, up from the\xa01.5 per cent recorded in October.\nThe headline consumer price index, or overall inflation, jumped to 3.8\xa0per cent\xa0year-on-year in November\xa0- the highest in more than\xa0eight years - compared with 3.2\xa0per cent in the previous month.\xa0\nIn the near term, Ms Low said Singapore is likely to continue to face external cost pressures.\nThis is due to global energy prices remaining elevated and bottlenecks in global transportation, as well as supply-demand mismatches in various commodities and goods markets which are likely to persist for a while, she said.\nHowever, authorities expect these pressures\xa0to ease gradually over the course of the year.\n""In particular, global oil prices should ease as production increases to catch up with demand,"" she added.\nOn Singapore’s domestic labour, Ms Low said wage growth is likely to continue to improve as the demand for labour strengthens on the back of a continued pickup in economic activity.\nThe Government’s rollout of policies such as the expansion of the Progressive Wage Model to the retail sector would also support salaries for lower-wage Singaporeans.\nAt the same time, as the COVID-19 situation stabilises, Ms Low said consumer demand should improve.\n“With these factors in mind, MAS core inflation is expected to increase in the first half of 2022, before easing in the latter part of the year. For the full year, MAS core inflation could average within the upper half of the official forecast range of 1 per cent to 2 per cent,” she said.\nAs for CPI-All Items inflation, Ms Low said it is projected to average 1.5 to 2.5 per cent in 2022, following the 2.3 per cent expected for 2021.\nThe Ministry of Trade and Industry and the Monetary Authority of Singapore will carefully monitor price trends over the next few months of the year closely, before revising the forecasts if necessary, she added.\nWhile Singapore’s small and open economy constrains how much the country can shield itself from inflationary pressures, Ms Low said the Government has put in place a “multi-pronged” strategy to mitigate inflationary pressures.\nThis includes striving hard to keep the country’s economy competitive, in order to continue creating good jobs to bring sustainable wage growth for Singaporeans, she said.\nWhile the economy contracted by 5.4 per cent in 2020\xa0due to the pandemic, it rebounded by 7.2 per cent last year.\n“The strong recovery has helped to ensure that resident workers enjoyed real wage growth in 2021, after accounting for inflation. Specifically, we note that in 2021, the real median income growth of full-time employed residents was actually positive, at 1.1 per cent,” she said.\nFor lower-income residents at the bottom 20th percentile, real income rose by a larger 4.6 per cent\xa0last year, she added.\nWith Singapore importing more than 90 per cent of its food, Ms Low said the Government has been diversifying food import sources to reduce vulnerability to large price fluctuations globally and ensure that food supply prices remain competitive.\nSingapore imports food from more than 170 countries and regions around the world.\n“Notably, while global food commodity prices surged by around 30 per cent\xa0on a year-on-year basis between July and November 2021 based on the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization’s Food Price Index, our domestic non-cooked food prices saw a far smaller increase of 1.6 per cent\xa0over the same period,” said Ms Low.\nThe Government also works closely with industry partners, including major retailers, to ensure that the prices of daily necessities and food items are competitive and affordable, she said.\nFor instance, NTUC FairPrice extended its discount schemes for seniors and low-income families by another year, to 2022, to keep the prices of essential items affordable.\nMs Low said the move is estimated to result in more than S$11 million worth of savings for customers, covering Pioneer Generation and Merdeka Generation seniors, as well as Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) blue cardholders.\nThe Government also provides targeted assistance to lower-income Singaporeans who need support for their basic living expenses through schemes such as the permanent GST Voucher scheme, and public transport vouchers.\nIn spite of inflation, the Ministry of Trade and Industry’s assessment is that Singapore’s economic recovery remains on track, with GDP expected to grow by 3\xa0to 5 per cent\xa0this year, she said.\nMs Low added that this should continue to support recovery in the labour market in the year ahead.\nIn October last year,\xa0MAS\xa0tightened monetary policy by shifting the trade-weighted Singapore dollar towards an appreciating path, given the imported and domestic cost pressures.\nSince then, Ms Low said the Singapore dollar has strengthened, which will help reduce the Singapore dollar\xa0cost of imports\xa0and shield Singaporeans from some of the external cost pressures.\n“The Singapore dollar has appreciated significantly against the currencies of the country’s major food sources over the longer term, and this has moderated the pass-through effects of external inflationary pressure,” she said.\nCareful attention such as rental relief and schemes to alleviate labour costs has also been given to manage domestic supply-side constraints, such as the supply of industrial and commercial space, said Ms Low.\nThis will help to rein in business rental costs that may translate to higher consumer prices, she added.\n', 'related_topics': ['     inflation ', '     food ', '     Singapore Parliament ']}"

      Commentary: Exercise can reduce junk food cravings and prevent stress eating
  </h1>, 'text': 'LONDON, Canada: Every January, millions of individuals make New Year’s resolutions to lose weight or eat healthier, if not both.\nTo achieve this goal, many individuals will begin strenuous exercise programmes that incorporate too much exercise too soon, leading to fitness burnout or injury. Overtraining can actually prevent you from losing weight.\nThe truth is that you simply cannot exercise away a poor diet and expect to lose weight (if that is your goal).\nHumans are very good at conserving energy and will account for any calories burned through exercise by consuming more calories later in the day or by being less physically active throughout the rest of the day.\nThat being said, you can — and should — use exercise to help you lose weight and maintain your weight loss. But not to offset calories consumed.\nIf you are looking to lose weight, the only way to do it is by controlling your calorie intake. The best and most effective way of doing that is limiting the consumption of ultra-processed foods — typical “junk foods” and fast-food meals.\nEven if you are not trying to lose weight, reducing ultra-processed food consumption is good for mental and physical health.\nRegular exercise makes it easier to do this by improving the brain and cognitive processes that help us regulate junk food consumption, and by reducing stress.\nAnd the best part is, as little as 20 minutes of brisk walking is all you need to get the beneficial effects.\nWe know that we shouldn’t overeat candy, cookies, cake and chips, or drink sugary sodas. Diets that are high in these ultra-processed foods cause us to gain weight. But they are just so hard to resist.\nUltra-processed junk foods have been designed to be as tasty and rewarding as possible.\nWhen we are exposed to advertisements, or actual food items (for example, chocolate bars in the checkout lane at grocery stores), brain activity in regions associated with reward processing increases.\nThis reward-related brain activity results in increased food cravings and the drive to eat, even when we are not hungry.\nA brain region known as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) helps us limit the consumption of ultra-processed foods by both decreasing activity in these reward regions to reduce food cravings and by initiating the cognitive processes needed to exert conscious control over food choices.\nWhen using functional brain imaging to examine brain responses, neuroscientists have shown that increased activity in the dlPFC helps us control food cravings and select healthier food items by decreasing activity in the reward regions of the brain.\nConversely, when activity in the dlPFC is decreased, we have a harder time resisting the temptation of appealing junk foods and will consume more snack foods.\nExercise boosts brain plasticity, which is the brain’s ability to adapt its functions based on new input. Boosting brain plasticity makes it easier to change our habits and lifestyle.\nMore and more evidence has shown that regular physical activity can increase prefrontal brain function and improve cognition.\nThese exercise-induced increases in prefrontal brain function and cognition makes it easier to regulate or limit our consumption of junk foods. And we can see the effects with as little as 20 minutes of moderate intensity exercise.\nI have shown that people consume less ultra-processed food such as chips or milk chocolate after 20 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise (in our study, this was a brisk walk at 5.6-6.1 kilometres per hour on a treadmill with a slight incline).\nResearch has also shown that both a single session of high-intensity interval training and a 12-week high-intensity aerobic exercise program can reduce preferences or appetite for high-calorie junk foods.\nSimilar effects are seen when people engage in moderate aerobic exercise or strength training.\nThe key takeaway here is that regular exercise can reduce how much people want junk foods and improve their ability to resist the temptation of these appealing foods by improving brain function and cognition.\nThis makes it easier to limit the consumption of these foods to achieve healthier eating and weight loss goals.\nWhen people are stressed, the body releases a hormone called cortisol, which activates what is known as the fight-or-flight response.\nWhen cortisol levels are high, the brain thinks it needs more fuel, resulting in increased cravings for sugary or salty ultra-processed foods.\nParticipation in regular exercise or a single bout of exercise reduces perceived stress levels and cortisol levels. Exercise also helps reduce unhealthy drink and food consumption when people are stressed.\nStress can also impact how the brain functions. Research has shown that stress can result in decreased activity in the prefrontal cortex and increased activity in reward regions of the brain when looking at pictures of food. This makes it harder to resist the temptation of appealing junk foods.\nBy offsetting the impact of stress on prefrontal brain function, exercise makes it easier to maintain your goals of healthier eating or reducing junk food consumption.\nTwenty minutes of brisk walking can help the prefrontal cortex recover from temporary changes in activity, like the ones seen when people are stressed.\nNext time you are feeling stressed, try going for a brisk 20-minute walk. It could prevent you from stress-eating.\nResearchers often get asked what is the best exercise and how much exercise to do.\nAt the end of the day, the best exercise is one you enjoy and can sustain over time.\nHigh-intensity interval training (HIIT), aerobic exercise, meditation and mindfulness, yoga and strength training are all effective in helping improve diet by targeting prefrontal brain function and reducing stress.\nIf you are beginning a new exercise routine this new year, ease into it, be kind to yourself, listen to your body and remember that a little goes a long way.\nCassandra J Lowe is a postdoctoral fellow at The Brain and Mind Institute, Department of Psychology, Western University.

      Commentary: Plant-based diets and foods aren't all healthy
  </h1>, 'text': 'TORONTO: As we ring in the new year and people announce their resolutions and goals for 2022, many opt for getting healthy, cutting out drinking or starting a new hobby.\nVegan magazines and organisations are pushing plant-based diets — calling it the “ultimate new year’s resolution.”\nBut plant-based meats are often high in sodium, ultra-processed and not any healthier than the meat they imitate. Meanwhile, nearly half of the consumers think they are more nutritious.\nSo if your resolution is related to health, you may want to reconsider switching to a plant-based diet.\nThe Impossible Burger, for example, is an impressive meat-free mix of soy, potato proteins, coconut and sunflower oils. It even bleeds like the real thing.\nAt the same time its calorie count and saturated fat levels mirror a McDonald’s quarter-pounder, and it has six times more sodium.\nThe global market for plant-based meat is projected to explode to US$85 billion in 2030.\nAnd grocery stores are taking note, featuring an array of burgers, sausages, nuggets, ground meat and seafood options all without any trace of animal products.\nAccording to one study this year, the nutritional benefit of plant-based foods is minimal.\nResearchers from the Singapore Institute for Food and Biotechnology Innovation modelled the outcome of replacing bacon, chicken, beef burgers and ice cream with animal-free versions.\nDiets that substituted animal products with the plant-based alternative were below the daily recommendations for vitamin B12, calcium, potassium, zinc and magnesium, and higher in sodium, sugar and saturated fat.\nEven with added vitamins and minerals, these products are not nutritionally interchangeable, says Stephan van Vliet, a postdoctoral associate at the Duke Molecular Physiology Institute.\n“Meat made from plants isn’t meat made from cows and meat made from cows isn’t meat made from plants,” he says.\nAnimal sources like meat, milk and eggs are complete proteins, meaning they contain enough of the nine essential amino acids we must get from our diets every day.\nPlant-based foods like fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds and grains often lack one or more of these amino acids and need to be eaten in combination.\nPlant-based meat manufacturers argue their products contain similar amounts of protein that are comparable in quality to animal protein.\nBut focusing on protein is too “simplistic,” says van Vliet. “Foods contain hundreds to thousands of compounds that are capable of impacting human metabolism and health.”\nVan Vliet and colleagues compared 190 molecules in plant-based meat alternatives with grass-fed ground beef and found that 90 per cent of them were different.\nPlant-based meat alternatives lacked certain amino acids and derivatives, like creatine, taurine and anserine, “which can all have an impact on our health and potentially brain function as well as muscle function,” he says.\nOther metabolites like polyphenols and antioxidants were found in greater quantities or exclusively in plant-based meats.\nHe sees plant and animal source foods as complementary in our diet, where some nutrients are better obtained from animal sources and others from plants.\n“People opt for a plant-based burger for a variety of reasons,” says Rosie Schwartz, a Toronto-based consulting dietitian, “including reducing meat intake.” But she argues that consumers should rethink their reasoning if it’s because of health.\n“To substitute something plant-based as a substitute because it’s called plant-based is really steering us in the wrong direction,” says Schwartz.\nAccording to nutrition scientists and Canada’s Food Guide, plant-based is the recommended way we should be eating. Fill half your plate with vegetables and fruits, and the other half with whole grains and proteins.\nBut “plant-based” also refers to anything from meat to paint to pillowcases, as long as they were made mostly or completely of plants, according to the Merriam-Webster dictionary.\nJust because it’s made from plants, doesn’t mean it’s healthy. “I do think it’s very confusing for the consumer,” says van Vliet.\n“It’s probably not the chicken, but everything else that comes with the chicken nugget that is probably detrimental to our health.”\nUp until this point, plant-based meat companies focused on the taste, texture and appearance of its products. These companies targeted meat eaters by creating plant-based marvels meant to look, taste and feel like the real thing.\nImpossible Foods, the creator of the Impossible Burger, says 90 per cent of their customers are still meat eaters. It isn’t in the business of converting salad and tempeh-eating veggie lovers into fake meat consumers.\n“The whole mission of Impossible Foods is to create plant-based products that compete directly against animal meat,” said Esther Cohn, communications manager at Impossible Foods.\n“If you eat five beef burgers a week, we want you to swap, even just try swapping one out for an Impossible Burger.”\nWith a booming market and new animal-free proteins made from cells in a lab or fungi in fermentation tanks, the options are endless. Can they be adapted to be healthier as well? We’ll have to wait and see.\nMeghan McGee is a nutritional scientist at the University of Toronto.

      Commentary: So your kitchen has been overrun by pantry moths. Don't panic
  </h1>, 'text': 'SYDNEY: Has your home recently been overrun by tiny grey moths, flapping erratically around your kitchen? Spotted some suspicious webs in a cereal box? You might be sharing your dried food with pantry moths (also known as plodia interpunctella).\nAlthough several species of moth can live and breed in our homes, the pantry moth (also known as the “Indian meal moth”) is one of the most common unwanted moth-guests.\nPantry moths are found on every continent except Antarctica. They feed on rice, grains, flour, pasta, cereals, dried fruits, spices, seeds, nuts and other dried food. Their fondness for dried foods makes them a major pest in food storage facilities.\nSo how did they get in your house – and what can you do to get rid of them?\nLike other moths, pantry moths have four distinct life stages: Egg, caterpillar, pupae and adult.\nThe first sign of a pantry moth infestation is often the sight of adult moths flying in an erratic, zig-zag path around our kitchens.\nPantry moth adults have grey wings with bronze or tan bands near the wing tips.\nAlthough they can be annoying, adult moths do not feed at all. The trouble arises when female moths lay their eggs in or around our food.\nThe tiny eggs hatch into barely visible cream-coloured caterpillars small enough to crawl into poorly sealed food containers. There, they begin to feed.\nAs they grow, caterpillars produce large amounts of silk webbing and faeces, both of which can contaminate food.\nOnce a caterpillar reaches its full size, it leaves the food in search of a safe space to make a cocoon, usually a crack, container lid, crevice or corner. Sometimes they turn up in the hinges of a pantry door.\nA few weeks later, an adult moth emerges from the cocoon, ready to start the cycle again.\nUnfortunately, it’s likely you brought them home yourself. Although pantry moths can enter via doors and windows, most infestations probably start when we inadvertently bring home eggs and caterpillars in our dried foods.\nKitchens full of unsealed containers and spilled food create an irresistible smorgasbord for female moths looking for the ideal place to lay eggs.\nLike many insects, pantry moths develop more quickly at warmer temperatures.\nAt warmer temperatures, females also lay more eggs and caterpillars are more likely to survive to adulthood.\nBut prolonged exposure to temperatures above 40 degrees Celsius are lethal to eggs and caterpillars.\nWhile pantry moths can be found at any time of the year, the warm temperatures of late spring and early summer are often perfect for supporting rapid population growth.\nFirst, eliminate their sources of food. Dry goods should be stored in sealed, airtight containers with tight-fitting lids.\nTo prevent eggs and caterpillars from hitchhiking in on purchases, place dried foods in the freezer for three to four days; this should kill any eggs and caterpillars that may be present.\nIf you already have an infestation, carefully inspect all potential food sources including spices, cereals, grains, dry pet foods, pasta, seeds, nuts, tea, dried flowers and dried fruit.\nPantry moth caterpillars are hard to see; look for the silken webbing they produce, which can cause food grains to clump together. These webbed clumps are often more conspicuous than the caterpillars themselves.\nInfested foods should either be discarded or placed in the freezer for three to four days to kill eggs and caterpillars.\nClean up and discard any spilled foods on shelves, under toasters or behind storage containers. Even small amounts of food can support thriving caterpillar populations.\nCaterpillars can travel considerable distances to find a safe place to make a cocoon, so make sure to check shelves, walls, crevices and ceilings. Moth cocoons can be removed by wiping with a damp cloth or with a vacuum cleaner.\nCleaning and proper food storage are the best ways to end a pantry moth outbreak. Sticky pantry moth traps are commercially available and can be used to monitor and reduce the moth population.\nPantry moth traps – triangular cardboard covered with a thick sticky glue – are baited with a chemical that mimics the smell of a female pantry moth.\nMales are attracted to the trap and become hopelessly stuck to the glue. Since sticky traps only target males, traps are unlikely to stop an outbreak on their own; always use them with proper food storage and careful cleaning.\nInsecticide sprays are unlikely to be effective as pantry moth caterpillars and eggs are protected within food containers.\nPantry moths are also resistant to a range of insecticides, rendering them ineffective. Insecticides should never be applied on or near food.\nWhile it can be disconcerting to find tiny caterpillars in the cereal you’ve been enjoying all week, accidentally eating pantry moth caterpillars is unlikely to cause any health problems.\nGiven how common they are in stored food, you’ve probably already unknowingly consumed many moth eggs and larvae.\nThank goodness caterpillars are generally an excellent source of protein.\nTanya Latty is an Associate Professor at the School of Life and Environmental Sciences at the University of Sydney.

      Meet the Singaporean chef whose approach to food is ‘borderless’ 
  </h1>, 'text': 'Towards the end of last year, a former colleague, who is a serious and passionate foodie, messaged me about kanves, a new private dining establishment, she visited. She had lucked out and because one of her friends was friends with the chef, they went for an early preview. She raved about the young chef Ethan Khoo and the dishes he was serving. I immediately messaged him via Instagram and begged for a slot.\nI’ve since been to kanves three times. It is, in my books, one of the very best—if not the best—modern private dining experience in Singapore. Ethan’s dishes are unique, creative, and most importantly, absolutely delicious. \nThis quiet\xa0and proper 31-year-old, who trained at local establishments such as Morsels, Pollen and Les Amis, was, before returning to Singapore, working at a three-hatted (the Antipodean equivalent of three Michelin stars) fine dining restaurant in Auckland, New Zealand. Unfortunately, Clooney closed in late 2019 and instead of venturing the California for more experiences, Khoo, partly due to the pandemic has stayed home. And, to the pleasure of local foodies, been wowing us ever since he opened kanves.\nHI ETHAN, WERE YOU A FOODIE GROWING UP?\nA hundred per cent! My parents were always of the belief that children should try everything when they’re young. In truth, I think it was because they didn’t want us to limit their dining preferences because they were foodies too. But that meant that we were always brought along to restaurants, even fine dining establishments, during our travels.\nWHAT WAS YOUR FONDEST FOODIE CHILDHOOD MEMORY?\nMy fondest memory would be following my mum and helper around in the kitchen, observing them preparing and cooking our meals, especially when it came to preparing our heritage Hokkien style popiah recipe that has been passed down through the generations. I’m actually hoping to feature this heritage dish in a charity fundraising initiative in the future. \nHOW DID YOU END UP PURSUING A CAREER IN CULINARY?\nAfter graduating from the University of Melbourne with a Commerce degree in Finance and Marketing, I persuaded my parents to allow me to take a gap year in 2014 to dip my toes in the culinary world. This was my opportunity to see if the culinary world was something I really wanted to make a career out of.\nWHAT DID YOUR PARENTS THINK OF YOUR CAREER CHOICE?\nAs with most Asian parents, they were initially hesitant about my decision. I mean I understood their hesitance and worries, as they knew how taxing being a chef can be: the extremely long working hours, little to no social life, and little pay. Parents only want the best for their kids, and they wanted to be sure that I knew what I was getting myself into. That’s why I was met with resistance when I initially told them that I wanted to enrol into culinary school instead of university. They felt that it was better to have a degree as a fall-back plan, if a career in culinary didn’t quite work out. \nThat being said, my parents have been immensely supportive throughout, even to the extent of providing their home for me to operate kanves.\nWHERE DID YOU BEGIN YOUR TRAINING HERE AND WHAT LESSONS DID YOU LEARN THERE\nWithout any formal culinary training, it was slightly challenging entering the industry. However, thanks to some connections, a family friend connected me with Chef Petrina of Morsels, a great little restaurant in Little India, which is now located at Dempsey. That was my first foray into a professional kitchen.\nMy biggest takeaways were the stringent organisational skills which rang true to my own OCD-ness. This had set me up to be the chef that I am today as it was ingrained into my work ethic to be meticulous, precise and always organised in whatever I do, no matter how trivial the task.\nBeing a one-man show running kanves, I would not be able to smoothly orchestrate the execution of the menu if it weren’t for being this organised.\nWHY GO OVERSEAS TO FURTHER YOUR CAREER?\nI wanted to be pushed outside of my comfort zone, to experience a different format of how kitchens are run in a different country. But more importantly to work in a place that experiences all four seasons, to be immersed in true seasonality where you’re forced to only use the local and season-focused produce—something which I feel restaurants in Singapore may sometimes take for granted when you can import literally anything from either hemisphere.\nWAS IT EASY OR DIFFICULT TO MOVE TO NEW ZEALAND TO LIVE AND WORK?\nIt definitely wasn’t the easiest. The biggest hurdle was getting my work visa approved, which involved many supporting documents including testimonials from many of the restaurants I had previously worked for to prove my competence since I had no formal certification in terms of a culinary diploma or degree.\nFinding an appropriate accommodation within walking distance from the restaurant was also challenging. Thankfully, the owner of the restaurant, Tony Stewart of Clooney Restaurant, was kind enough to offer me a temporary place to put up with for free while I searched for a more permanent lodging. I was also very blessed to form really close bonds with the people I worked with at Clooney, two of which became my housemates. \nWHAT DID YOU MISS MOST WHEN YOU WERE OVERSEAS?\nThe easy access to local Singaporean food! That was probably what made me homesick the most. In fact, I would cook local Singaporean dishes for our staff meal in the kitchen, exposing our culturally- diversified kitchen crew to local flavours that I grew up with, such as ayam sioh, nasi lemak, laksa and even ngoh hiang. I remember even making Shanghainese Zha Jiang Mian, right down to making the handmade noodles—a nod to my Shanghainese roots. I’m really thankful to have had access to well stocked Asian grocers in New Zealand that allowed me to achieve those authentic flavours – truly a small taste of home.\nHOW DID THE EXPERIENCE THERE SHAPE WHO YOU ARE, AS A PERSON AND AS A CHEF?\nHaving to live in another country without many familiar faces, your kitchen family becomes your family. \nI think working at Clooney really taught me the importance of being flexible, open-minded and leading by example, especially with a kitchen team comprising chefs with different cultural backgrounds, personalities and where English may not even be their first language. \nAs a junior sous chef at Clooney, part of my job scope was managing the kitchen team. As it was my first time holding a leadership position, there were times where I found it challenging trying to navigate the different personalities and cultural differences, and I learnt that a leader should never be afraid to do the grunt work, like washing the dishes, mopping the floors, throwing out the trash.\xa0In fact, doing those things actually that earned me the team’s respect. That was my biggest takeaway from working in New Zealand.\nIF THE RESTAURANT YOU WERE WORKING AT DIDN’T CLOSE, DO YOU THINK YOU WOULD HAVE STILL COME BACK?\nYes, I would still have. I had the intention to work in the USA, especially the West Coast, to gain a different perspective. I identified with modern American cuisine, where produce was king and food wasn’t really defined by a specific cuisine style, but rather multicultural influences. This resonates with my cooking style.\nWHAT ARE YOUR IMPRESSIONS OF THE LOCAL DINING SCENE?\nI think the local dining scene has come quite far, from back in the days when I used to work at Pollen. It’s definitely more vibrant and varied in its offerings. For example, I see a lot more restaurants championing local or native cuisines in a contemporary way. The local food scene has also become more competitive with the entrance of the Michelin Food Guide in the last few years. The rise of home-based and private dining establishments also lends to the vibrancy of Singapore’s local dining scene. \nWHY OPEN YOUR OWN PRIVATE DINING INSTEAD OF WORKING AT A RESTAURANT WHEN YOU RETURNED?\nNow in my thirties, I’ve come to realise that after a few years working for someone and executing someone else’s menu, it’s about time to establish a direction of my own. Private home dining offers me an avenue to explore my own cooking philosophy. It allows me to boldly experiment with new ingredients, new flavours, new combinations, while allowing me to learn from my mistakes. \nWHAT GAVE YOU THE CONFIDENCE TO DO SOMETHING ON YOUR OWN?\nI’m really very blessed to have supportive parents in my journey as a chef. \nI think being at home, in my playground, also gives me the opportunity to make mistakes and explore. It’s a safe space to explore and experiment, without any obligations to stakeholders and employees. Essentially, I can just focus on the food. The customers are also more receptive to different experiences compared to restaurants.\nHOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE YOUR FOOD?\nI would say that it’s contemporary in nature, globally influenced and where less is more. Focusing on usually not more than four main components and layering flavours through the processes behind each element, I try to highlight and showcase more local produce, which if treated the right way, I feel can be elevated to a level comparable to imported produce which people often perceive to be a better product.\nHOW DID YOU BUILD YOUR CUSTOMER BASE?\xa0\nInitially, it was just for close friends and family during my soft-opening and I wanted things to spread and grow organically through word of mouth. I really wanted to build a customer base who genuinely enjoyed their experience at kanves and on their own volition, recommended to their friends. With social media and with Singapore being so small, word did get around pretty quickly. \nWHAT IS YOUR CREATION PROCESS? HOW DO YOU COME UP WITH NEW DISHES?\nIt starts with a specific produce which I’m inspired by. Sometimes, it’s produce which people, myself included, perceive to be underrated. These are the types of ingredients which I tend to gravitate to, especially vegetables. For instance, cordyceps are usually used in soup-based dishes in Chinese cuisines. However, I treat them like any other fungi or mushroom. Take for example, when fresh cordyceps are chargrilled with roasted chicken fat, and paired with a local white corn millet porridge. This was a dish previously featured on our summer menu.\xa0\nI also take notes every time I dine out or encounter pairings that intrigue me. You can say that this is my idea bank and I use it for inspiration when ideating for new dishes.\nWHAT IS THE BIGGEST MISCONCEPTION OF WHAT YOU DO?\nI think the biggest misconception is the assumption that I only work from Friday to Sunday as those are my operating hours. On the contrary, I work the entire week. Monday right through to Thursdays are actually days where I spend preparing for those three days of service. I also use those days to do R&D.\nA lot of my dishes might look deceptively simple on the plate, but it does take many days to build the different components of my dishes, from dehydrating beetroot, dry-aging ducks for a week, to lacto-fermenting three different varieties of red apples.\nARE THERE ANY CHEFS, HERE OR ABROAD, THAT REALLY INSPIRE YOU?\nI wouldn’t say there is anyone in particular, but everyone whom I’ve worked for or worked with over the years has inspired me. Especially my peers who started out being mere colleagues who eventually became people I can call as my closest friends—many of which have carved their own path to passionately pursue their own ventures. Some of these friends include Maxine Ngooi of Tigerlily, whom I worked with at Les Amis, as well as Ethel Hoon of Kloesterle Restaurant, who operates the restaurant with her husband Jakob in the alpine town of Zug in Austria. \nHOW DID THE PANDEMIC AFFECT YOUR BUSINESS?\nBeing a home-based business operating out of a private home, the heightened restrictions limiting unique visitors per household really did put a strain on existing guest commitments. Many reschedules had to be made, especially when there were two-pax restrictions for a substantial part of the year. With prep work that only has economies of scale for larger groups, it wasn’t as feasible to operate dine-in. Like many other home-based private dining businesses, I had to pivot to takeaway offerings for a period of time.\nThat being said, the ‘forced’ downtime was a good time to rest and reset whilst pursuing R&D for new dishes.\nANY PLANS TO OPEN A RESTAURANT?\nIn short, the answer is I’m not quite ready to open one as yet, but definitely keen to explore it in the future. Not nearly enough people truly understand how difficult it is to open a restaurant and what it entails. To me, owning and running a restaurant is a great privilege and with that privilege comes immense responsibility.\nIf I were to open a restaurant in the future, it’ll only be because I’m in the right headspace and have the financial means to do so. I want to create a restaurant with a supportive working culture, where chefs are not only passionate about their craft, but are inspired by each other to grow their career, and at the end of the day, serve simply delicious food.\nWHAT ARE YOUR GOALS FOR 2022?\nTo grow as a chef by honing my craft while surprising and delighting guests by showcasing local ingredients in a uniquely kanves way. Achieving all of this whilst still maintaining a healthy dose of work life balance, as I feel it’s extremely important to make sure I don’t get burnt out and lose my passion, especially when lines sometimes get blurred when work is home and home is work.\n', 'related_topics': ['     food ', '     F&B ', '     chef ', '     Restaurants ', '     Career ']}"

      Commentary: That Christmas dinner may mean 12 hours of walking to burn calories
  </h1>, 'text': 'LOUGHBOROUGH, England: Overeating at Christmas time is almost like a tradition. Many of us look forward to piling our plates full of festive foods, snacking on chocolate throughout the holidays or sipping on festive drinks.\nEven if you were trying to eat healthier, indulgent foods are often displayed more prominently in supermarkets and shops during the holidays, making it difficult to pass up on our favourite foods and drinks.\nThe British Dietetic Association estimates that on Christmas day alone people might consume around 6,000 calories – with Christmas dinner responsible for most of these.\nBut spending time with friends, work Christmas parties and New Year’s celebrations might all see us overeat in the days and even weeks before and after Christmas. It’s no wonder the average adult gains around 0.5-1 kg over the Christmas holidays.\nWhile that might not sound like a lot, the weight we gain during the festive season isn’t always lost in the new year.\nThis excess weight gain over the years could see some people become overweight or obese, which may increase their risk of many conditions, including cancer, diabetes, hypertension or stroke.\nBut research shows that giving people information about how many minutes of walking (or running) it will take to burn off the calories from foods or drinks can help people eat less and avoid gaining weight at Christmas.\nSo, how much walking do you need to do in order to burn off Christmas dinner?\nFor an adult weighing 84kg it will take about 12 hours of steady paced walking (around four miles or 6.4km\xa0an hour) to burn off the calories of an average Christmas dinner.\nThis is the equivalent of walking approximately 50 miles or 80km. Or, if you prefer, you could jog for about five to six hours.\nOf course, the number of calories in your dinner will also depend on what foods you eat, how you prepare them and whether you go back for seconds.\nFor example, if you cut out the pre-dinner nibbles and appetisers, and only have a yule log for dessert alongside two glasses of wine, your Christmas dinner may only come in around 2,080 calories.\nFor someone weighing 84kg, this would only take around six and a half hours of walking to burn off.\nThe amount of physical activity you’ll need to do to burn off your dinner will also depend on many factors such as age, gender and weight.\nHoliday weight gain does not have to be inevitable – and walking is a great activity you can do by yourself or with others.\nWhile walking for 12 hours straight isn’t something anyone wants to do during the holidays, there are many easy ways you can sneak more physical activity in during the holidays each day.\nFor example, try walking to the shops instead of using your car if you can, or take a cycle around your neighbourhood with your children to look at the Christmas lights.\nOf course, it’s hard not to indulge over Christmas since it only comes around once a year. Some other easy ways to eat fewer calories during the holidays include snacking wisely, and being cautious with your portions.\nIf you find that you have gained weight after Christmas don’t be disheartened and try to focus on reducing the treats, and setting yourself a goal to get your weight back on track as soon as you can in the new year.\nAmanda Daley is a Professor of Behavioural Medicine at Loughborough University.

      Commentary: Singapore’s festive indulgence creates enormous food waste 
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: ‘Tis the season of feasting. \nAnd although eco-friendly food habits, like eating less meat and avoiding food waste, have become more mainstream in recent years, we must ask ourselves the uncomfortable question as we attend holiday gatherings and stock up our kitchens: Do our efforts to reduce food waste go out of the window during the holidays?\nStatistics from the United Kingdom show that a disproportionate proportion\xa0of food waste is generated during the Christmas season, with household food waste levels rising 30 per cent.\nIn Australia, a Melbourne University study found that food waste rises in December and January as people eat out, with 40 per cent of food purchased as festive season stock ending up in the bin.\nIn the United States, household waste increases by 25 per cent during the period between Thanksgiving and the new year.\nAs for Singapore, the nation generated 665,000 tonnes of food waste last year, equivalent to the weight of about 46,000 double-decker buses — even as a National Environment Agency (NEA) survey in 2019 found that more consumers are adopting environmentally conscious food habits such as having no leftovers on their plates when eating out.\nOne reason for the festive waste spike is that the holiday season is associated with indulgence. People are less careful about their food habits. \nThere are more parties and buffets. Consumers might be tempted by deals at eateries and supermarkets to buy more than they need.\nAbout a quarter of Singapore households often throw away spoiled or expired food, mostly because they bought too much or it was hidden at the back of the fridge, another NEA study found.\nThen there is the Asian mindset that excess food should be prepared to prevent the embarrassment of guests and family members going hungry. The 2019 NEA survey found that 40 per cent of respondents over-catered for gatherings, with carbohydrates like rice and noodles commonly getting binned.\nIt is also possible Singaporeans simply underestimate how much they toss. Most respondents in a Milieu Insight poll in October last year said their households threw away only small or “reasonable” amounts of food.\nConsumers are not the only contributors, however, to the problem. About 40 per cent of Singapore’s food waste comes from the commercial and industrial sectors.\nFood waste is one of the priority waste streams in Singapore’s Zero Waste Masterplan, which aims to slash waste going to Semakau Landfill by 30 per cent by 2030 to prevent the landfill from running out of space by 2035.\nAnd with the holiday season being one of the biggest culprits in the food waste problem, it is a good place to start.\nEfforts in other nations to counter festive food waste can have lessons for us.\nChina, which sees large amounts of food waste during its festive season, rolled out a Clean Plate\xa0campaign against food waste last year, with the Wuhan Catering Association suggesting diners order one dish less than the number of people gathering.\nAustralian consumers this year are snapping up festive gift boxes of imperfect but fresh fruit and vegetables from social enterprise Good and Fugly, which come with a cooking demo designed to reduce food waste.\nIn Thailand, consumers have snapped up over 20,000 boxes of discounted, unsold food items from eateries, hotels and supermarkets on food waste start-up app Yindii.\nIn South Korea, meanwhile, 95 per cent of food waste is recycled — into fertiliser and animal feed, for example — thanks to a system requiring households to bag food waste separately and pay fees according to the weight of the waste.\nThis is valorisation at work — the act of making something useful from an existing substance, which in this case is the conversion of food waste into new products.\nThis approach can speed up our progress in food waste reduction and close Singapore’s waste loop, beyond typical calls for consumers to order just enough, make use of leftovers or donate surplus food.\nSome Singapore companies are making strides in this area. Crust Group is partnering restaurants and food retail outlets to turn their surplus products into beer and sparkling water.\nAsia Pacific Breweries transforms spent barley grains from the beer-brewing process into ingredients for animal feed.\nInsectta breeds black soldier flies to make biomaterial, with the larvae converting food waste into natural fertiliser, while TRIA uses a rapid digestion technology to convert food waste and disposable foodware into fertiliser.\nSingapore is keenly examining the circular economy as a solution to its food waste problem.\nFrom 2024, large food-waste generators in the commercial and industrial sectors will be required to segregate and treat their food waste. This opens up more options for waste treatment, including valorisation.\nWhile the circular economy can slash food waste, it requires a joint effort, such as partnerships between stakeholders and collaborations between business and research experts to develop more food valorisation capabilities.\nThe NEA has set up an Industry Steering Committee focused on creating a circular economy for food. It is looking to encourage more firms to adopt valorisation solutions to upcycle food waste.\nTackling food waste is also a key topic that industry captains, innovators and policymakers will discuss at the biennial CleanEnviro Summit Singapore in April.\nOur food waste recycling progress has been promising, jumping from 10 per cent in 2011 to 19 per cent last year. Singapore recycled 126,000 tonnes of food waste last year, close to double the 70,000 tonnes a decade ago.\nStill, this means the bulk of food waste goes to the waste-to-energy plants.\nGoing back to the festive waste problem, it appears that it will take more time for consumer mindsets and food habits to shift towards mindfulness of food waste during the holidays.\nLuckily, while we move towards that goal, technological advancements are simultaneously making it easier to recycle our food waste. Yet it cannot replace the importance of stopping food waste from being generated at one main source: Us.\nSo, while we shop at the supermarket or order meals for our gatherings, let us think harder about preventing food waste. That is even better than finding a solution for it.\nSeeram Ramakrishna is Professor and Circular Economy Taskforce Chair at the National University of Singapore; and ESG Committee Member of the Singapore Institute of Directors. He was a speaker at the CleanEnviro Summit Singapore Catalyst 2021, which discussed the topic of Enhancing Sustainable Development in a Pandemic World.\n', 'related_topics': ['     food ', '     food waste ', '     Christmas ', '     Waste ']}"

      Commentary:  Global food price hikes are getting out of hand
  </h1>, 'text': 'COVENTRY, England: Global food prices shot up nearly 33 per cent in September compared with the same period the year before.\nThat’s according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO)‘s monthly Food Price Index, which also found that global prices have risen by more than 3 per cent since July, reaching levels not seen since 2011.\nThe Food Price Index is designed to capture the combined outcome of changes in a range of food commodities, including vegetable oils, cereals, meat and sugar, and compare them month to month.\nIt converts actual prices to an index, relative to average price levels between 2002 and 2004. This is the standard source for tracking food prices – nominal prices, as they’re known, which means they’re not adjusted for inflation.\nWhile nominal prices tell us the monetary cost of buying food in the market, prices adjusted for inflation (what economists call “real” prices) are much more relevant to food security – how easily people can access appropriate nutrition.\nThe prices of all goods and services tend to rise faster than average incomes (though not always).\nInflation means that not only do buyers need to pay more per unit for food (due to its nominal price increase), but they have proportionately less money to spend on it, given the parallel price increases of everything else, except their wages and other incomes.\nBack in August, I analysed the FAO’s inflation-adjusted Food Price Index and found that real global food prices were actually higher than in 2011, when food riots contributed to the overthrow of governments in Libya and Egypt.\nBased on real prices, it is currently harder to buy food on the international market than in almost every other year since UN record keeping began in 1961.\nThe only exceptions are 1974 and 1975. Those food price peaks occurred following the oil price spike of 1973, which drove rapid inflation in many parts of the global economy, including the production and distribution of food.\nSo what’s now pushing food prices to historic levels?\nThe drivers of average international food prices are always complicated. The prices of different commodities rise and fall based on universal factors, as well as those specific to each commodity and region.\nFor example, the oil price rise which started in April 2020 has affected the prices of all food commodities on the FAO index, by increasing the costs of producing and transporting food.\nLabour shortages resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic have reduced the availability of workers to grow, harvest, process and distribute food, another universal cause of commodity price rises.\nThe real average price of food has actually been increasing since the year 2000, reversing the previous trend of a steady decline from the start of the 1960s.\nDespite global efforts – that have, in part, responded to targets set by both the UN Millennium Development and the subsequent Sustainable Development Goals to reduce hunger – prices have made food steadily less accessible.\nNo single commodity has been continually responsible for the average real price increase from 2000.\nBut the price index of edible oil crops has grown significantly since March 2020, driven mainly by the price of vegetable oils shooting up by 16.9 per cent between 2019 and 2020.\nAccording to FAO crop reports, this was due to the growing demand for biodiesel and unsupportive weather patterns.\nThe other food category adding most to the overall food price rise is sugar. Here, again, unfavourable weather, including frost damage in Brazil, has reduced supply and inflated prices.\nCereals have added less to overall price increases, but their accessibility worldwide is particularly important for food security.\nWheat, barley, maize, sorghum and rice account for at least 50 per cent of global nutrition, and as much as 80 per cent in the poorest countries.\nGlobal buffer stocks of these crops have been shrinking since 2017, as demand has outstripped supply. Running down stores has helped stabilise global markets, but prices have increased sharply from 2019.\nAgain, the reasons for individual fluctuations are complicated.\nBut something that deserves attention is the number of times since the year 2000 “unpredictable” and “unfavourable weather” has been reported by the FAO to have caused “reduced harvest expectations”, “weather-stricken harvests” and “production decrease”.\nEuropeans might worry about the price of pasta as Canadian droughts slash wheat harvests.\nBut, as the real price index for cereals creeps towards levels that escalated riots over the price of bread into general uprisings in 2011, there is an urgent need to consider how communities in less affluent regions can weather these stresses and avoid unrest.\nOur technological capacity and socioeconomic organisation cannot successfully manage unpredictable and unfavourable weather.\nNow would be a good time to imagine food supply in a world warmer by more than 2 degrees celcius – an outcome now considered increasingly likely according to the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report.\nWithout radical changes, climate breakdown will continue to reduce international access to imported food, well beyond any historical precedent.\nHigher prices will reduce food security, and if there is one solid law of social science, it’s that hungry people take radical steps to secure their livelihoods – especially where leaders are perceived to have failed.\nAlastair Smith is a senior teaching fellow in Global Sustainable Development at the University of Warwick.

      'We can never be complacent': Parents of children with allergies battle anxiety, low awareness
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The day she had to administer an EpiPen to her five-year-old daughter is seared into Ms Candice Huang’s memory.\nIn December last year, Ms Huang allowed her daughter\xa0to eat some chocolate that was given out at a mall. She checked that the ingredients on the label did not include cow’s milk or eggs, which the girl is severely allergic to.\nShe warned her daughter to take a little first, as was usual with new foods, but the girl “wolfed down” a large chunk. Then she began complaining of pain.\n“She started crying and vomiting and her eyes became bloodshot and she had so many dots around her eyes, which looked like burst blood vessels. She was crying and screaming and clenching and clawing at her throat.”\nMs Huang gave her antihistamines first, as is usual for an allergic reaction.\xa0But it did not work because her daughter was ""vomiting nonstop"". She started spitting out streaks of blood, which is when Ms Huang rushed to get an EpiPen. The auto-injector contains adrenaline that is used to treat someone who has a life-threatening allergic reaction.\nHer daughter regained her composure 30 seconds after the EpiPen was administered, but the experience was “so scary”, Ms Huang said.\nAlthough it was a lesson learnt the hard way, she said\xa0it has helped her whole family, including her daughter, to understand the consequences of a severe allergic reaction.\n“After they witnessed the EpiPen episode, I feel like my whole household is very vigilant now,” she told CNA.\nHer daughter is also more careful with chocolates now, and takes a small bite and waits for five minutes before taking another bite.\xa0\nWhile the incident was caused by incorrect labelling, Ms Huang said she has\xa0to bear some of the responsibility.\n“An allergy parent can never be too overly cautious and we can never be complacent for a second,” she said.\nParents CNA spoke to said that there is generally low awareness of severe allergies and how bad reactions can be.\n“Unless you have personally witnessed a severe allergic reaction, you would\xa0never imagine it to be like that,” Ms\xa0Huang said.\nShe added that people tend to make light of the potential consequences, mostly due to ignorance.\nShe recounted an incident when she wanted to buy some cookies, but realised they contained ingredients her daughter was allergic to. But the woman selling the cookies simply said: “Aiyah, a little bit sure can one lah.”\n“I cannot fault her or blame her for it because there’s simply just not enough awareness,” Ms Huang said.\nThe lack of awareness is common, said Ms Izlin Ismail, whose nine-year-old son is severely allergic\xa0to cow’s milk and eggs.\n“Even the \'point point rice\' or\xa0nasi padang I stay away, because it’s very difficult. The tongs that they use usually means cross-contamination, and some of them don’t get it – that there’s cross-contamination,” she said.\nEven at restaurants, many do not know what allergens might be in the food they serve, said Ms Amanda Chan, who has a six-year-old son who is severely allergic to eggs, dairy and peanuts.\nSometimes, restaurants within the same chain may also give conflicting information, she added.\nSingaporean Tan Wen Yang, whose five-year-old daughter had\xa0multiple severe allergies to foods like\xa0eggs, cow’s milk and nuts when he was living in Japan for 12 years, said things are different there.\nInformation on allergens was more readily available in Tokyo and Kanagawa, where he lived.\xa0The majority of popular or chain restaurants have a\xa0list that\xa0states the most common\xa0allergens used in their dishes, he said.\n""It\'s easy to check before ordering and many of the family-friendly restaurants\xa0have an allergen-free menu item,"" he said.\xa0""In general, many waiters and waitresses will know about allergies and advise correctly.""\nA severe or dangerous\xa0allergic reaction – or anaphylaxis – includes respiratory symptoms like coughing, wheezing, feeling of something stuck in the throat, change of voice and\xa0difficulty breathing.\xa0\nIt could also manifest in symptoms like fainting, looking pale, severe tummy pain and persistent vomiting, said National University Hospital\'s Dr Lydia Wong, who specialises in paediatric allergies.\nDr Mohana Rajakulendran, a paediatrician at Parkway East Hospital, said that anyone who has had a previous severe life-threatening allergic reaction needs to carry an EpiPen.\nThis includes people with multiple food allergies or with shellfish or peanut allergies, as they have a higher risk of more severe reactions,\xa0said Dr Mohana, who has a special interest in allergy and immunology.\nAbout 1 per cent of her patients need to carry an EpiPen, she said.\n“It acts on receptors on blood vessels and tissues to help improve circulation and blood pressure and reduce swelling during life-threatening reactions.”\nMost food allergic reactions are mild to moderate in severity, but even when anaphylaxis occurs, most patients\xa0recover with no long-term complications\xa0if treated promptly and correctly, said Dr Chong Kok Wee, the head of allergy service at KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital.\n“Death from food-related anaphylaxis is rare\xa0but can occur, and is usually preventable. Children with anaphylaxis should immediately be administered with an adrenaline auto-injector if available, or emergency medical services should be immediately activated,” said Dr Chong.\nIt is not just restaurants\'\xa0food parents have to be wary of, it’s food served in schools too. Preparing food for their school-going children and educating their teachers comes with the territory.\nMs Huang told CNA that her\xa0daughter\'s childcare centre customises meals for her to ensure they are allergen-free. But the centre is not able to provide suitable snacks, so her daughter brings her own snacks.\nHowever, as her daughter grows up, some situations have become harder for her\xa0to accept.\n“This year, she came home a few times and cried, asking: ‘Why my friends can eat all these and I can’t?’” Ms Huang said.\nWhile she feels sad hearing this, Ms Huang said there is not much she can do. She provides a separate dessert for her daughter if she knows that there will be a celebration, but sometimes there is no advance notice.\nShe also goes the extra mile to ensure that her child’s teachers know how to help her in case of an allergic reaction. She conducts her own training once a year on how to administer an EpiPen.\nMs Izlin enrolled her son in\xa0a primary school that had\xa0a staff member who knew about allergies and how to administer an EpiPen.\nShe packs food for her son for his recess breaks, and her domestic worker goes to the school to pass him lunch\xa0as his after-school student care centre does not provide allergen-free food.\nBut despite the efforts, a sandwich containing dairy was accidentally given to him earlier this year.\nThe boy complained of stomach pain and was sent to the sickbay in school, where\xa0he remained for an hour before he called his mother and sounded like his throat was blocked. Her son wears a bracelet that indicates his allergies.\n“I was thinking: ‘You are having an allergic reaction.\xa0Nobody is doing anything, what happened?’” she said.\xa0\nUnderneath the face mask he was wearing, he\xa0had broken out in hives, a symptom of his allergic reaction. It was Ms Izlin\xa0who eventually administered an EpiPen to him when she arrived at his school.\nHearing of such incidents makes Ms Chan, whose son will be entering Primary 1 in January, more anxious than she already is.\n“It’s a huge leap from kindergarten where the teachers may be more attentive,” she said, adding that children in primary school are expected to be more independent.\nApart from being expected to order food at the canteen himself and look after his own belongings, Ms Chan’s son will have to take care of his own safety.\n“He … needs to be very concerned about who’s eating what food around him and he’s got to be very careful that he isn’t exposing himself to his allergens unnecessarily,” she said.\n“That part is incredibly difficult.”\nThe EpiPen can make a difference between life and death, but parents have had to deal with the sometimes unpredictable supply of the device, following global disruptions.\nAmong them is Ms Deborah Tan, who had to administer the EpiPen on her two-year-old daughter twice in three months this year.\nAfter the second incident, when her daughter was hospitalised, Ms Tan was told by the hospital that they were out of EpiPen Jr for young children.\n“That was really traumatising because after this second time, when she actually needed two EpiPens (to get her condition under control), we were going home without any in hand,” she said.\nAfter calling other hospitals and retail pharmacies and realising that she could not get her hands on an EpiPen Jr, Ms Tan put up a “plea for help” on a\xa0Facebook group run by non-profit organisation Eczema and Allergy Support Foundation (SPEAK), asking if anyone could lend her one.\n“A kind mother reached out to me and I got it from her that same day,” she said.\nCost is also an issue, said Ms Chan, who is SPEAK’s chairperson. Each EpiPen typically costs S$160, and those with severe allergies are usually expected to carry two,\xa0in case one fails. The cost is not subsidised and ""adds up"", she said.\nParkway East Hospital\'s Dr Mohana suggested that the Health Ministry look into sourcing for more brands of auto-injectors so that are more options available to patients and to minimise disruptions to supply.\xa0\nShe added that the cost of EpiPens should be subsidised. \xa0\n“The price can be an important deterrent to many low- to middle-income families who do not purchase EpiPens due to the cost though medically advised to. EpiPens can save lives,” she said.\nParents said they hope that there is more awareness of allergies – especially severe ones –\xa0in school so they can rest assured that their children are safe.\n“It comes to a point where I may not be able to send my allergic child to daycare as I don’t have childcare options to support my having a full-time job,” said Ms Huang.\n“I hope there’ll be more awareness in schools, in the education sector so allergy kids can feel more included and their allergies can be professionally managed.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     Allergies ', '     food ', '     anaphylaxis ', '     health ', '     children ']}"

      Commentary: Angsty and irritable? It could be your poor diet
  </h1>, 'text': ""CALGARY, Canada: Emotional, non-rational, even explosive remarks in public discourse have escalated in recent years. Politicians endure insults during legislative discussions; scientists receive emails and tweets containing verbal abuse and threats.\nWhat's going on? This escalation in angry rhetoric is sometimes attributed to social media. But are there other influences altering communication styles?\nAs researchers in the field of nutrition and mental health, and authors of The Better Brain, we recognise that many in our society experience brain hunger, impairing their cognitive function and emotion regulation.\nObviously, we are not deficient in macronutrients: North Americans tend to get sufficient protein, fats (though usually not the best fats) and carbohydrates (usually not the good complex carbs).\nBut we are being cheated of micronutrients (minerals and vitamins), particularly in those whose food choices are dominated by ultra-processed products.\nUltra-processed products include things like soft drinks, packaged snacks, sweetened breakfast cereal and chicken nuggets.\nThey generally contain only trivial amounts of a few micronutrients unless they are fortified, but even then, only a few at higher amounts.\nThree published analyses from the 2004 Canadian Community Health Survey and the 2018 US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey revealed these sobering statistics:\nIn Canada, in 2004, 48 per cent of the caloric intake across all ages came from ultra-processed products; in the United States 67 per cent of what children aged two to 19 years consumed and 57 per cent of what adults consumed in 2018 were ultra-processed products.\nMost of us are aware that dietary intake is a huge issue in physical health because diet quality is associated with chronic health conditions such as obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The public is less aware of the impact of nutrition on brain health.\nGiven that our society's food choices have moved so strongly toward ultra-processed products, we need to learn about the substantial scientific evidence proving that micronutrient intake influences mental health symptoms, especially irritability, explosive rage and unstable mood.\nThe scientific evidence base for this statement is now vast, though it is so rarely mentioned in the media that few in the public are familiar with it.\nA dozen studies from countries like Canada, Spain, Japan and Australia have shown that people who eat a healthy, whole foods diet have fewer symptoms of depression and anxiety than people who eat a poor diet (mostly ultra-processed products).\nCorrelational studies cannot prove that nutritional choices are the cause of mental health problems.\nFor that we turn to some compelling prospective longitudinal studies in which people with no apparent mental health problems enter the study, are evaluated for their health and dietary patterns, and are then followed over time.\nSome of the results have been astonishing.\nIn a study of about 89,000 people in Japan with 10-15 years of followup, the suicide rate in those consuming a whole foods diet was half that of those eating less healthy diets, highlighting an important new direction not yet covered in current suicide prevention programs.\nHere in Canada, similarly powerful findings show how children's dietary patterns, as well as following other health guidelines on exercise and screen time, predicted which children aged 10 to 11 years would be referred for diagnosis of a mental disorder in the subsequent two years.\nIt follows that nutrition education ought to be one of the first lines of treatment for children in this situation.\nIrritability and unstable mood often characterise depression, so it's relevant that multiple independent studies have found that teaching people with depression, who were consuming relatively poor diets, how to change to a whole foods Mediterranean-style diet resulted in significant improvements.\nA Mediterranean-style diet is typically high in whole grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts, legumes, seafood and unsaturated fats such as olive oil.\nIn one such study, about one-third of the people who changed to a whole foods diet in addition to their regular treatment found their depression to be in remission after 12 weeks.\nThe remission rate in the control group using regular treatment but no diet changes was fewer than one in 10. The whole foods diet group also reported a cost savings of about 20 per cent in their weekly food budget.\nThis final point helps to dispel the myth that eating a diet of ultra-processed products is a way to save money.\nImportant evidence that irritability, explosive rage and unstable mood can be resolved with improved micronutrient intake comes from studies evaluating micronutrient supplements to treat mental health problems.\nMost public awareness is restricted to the ill-fated search for magic bullets: Studies of a single nutrient at a time. That is a common way to think about causality (for problem X, you need medication Y), but that is not how our brains work.\nTo support brain metabolism, our brains require at least 30 micronutrients to ensure the production of neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine, as well as breaking down and removing metabolic byproducts.\nMany studies of multi-nutrient treatments have found improved mood regulation and reduced irritability and explosive rage, including in placebo-controlled randomised trials of children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and mood dysregulation.\nThe evidence is clear: A well-nourished population is better able to withstand stress. Hidden brain hunger is one modifiable factor contributing to emotional outbursts, aggression and even the loss of civility in public discourse.\nBonnie Kaplan and Julia J Rucklidge are professors from the University of Calgary and Canterbury respectively.

      There's a better way to healthy eating without completely removing 'bad foods' from your diet
  </h1>, 'text': 'There are no “good” foods and “bad” foods. Rather, it’s your overall dietary pattern that matters most when it comes to healthful eating.\nThat’s the main message from the American Heart Association in its latest nutrition guidelines to improve the hearts and health of Americans of all ages and life circumstances.\nThe experts who wrote the guidelines recognise that people don’t eat nutrients or individual ingredients. They eat foods, and most people want to enjoy the foods they eat while staying within their budgets and, the association hopes, without injuring their bodies.\nThis doesn’t mean you need to totally avoid Big Macs, Cokes and French fries, but it does mean you should not regularly indulge in such fare if you want to stay healthy.\nDr Robert H\xa0Eckel, a former president of the American Heart Association, and an endocrinologist and lipid specialist at the University of Colorado Denver, told me he “occasionally” indulges in foods outside a wholesome dietary pattern. The operative word here, though, is “occasionally.”\nDr Neil J\xa0Stone, a preventive cardiologist at the Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern University, who praised the thoughtfulness and expertise of the guidelines committee, said in an interview, “There’s no such thing as one diet that fits all, but there are principles to form the basis of diets that fit everyone.”\nHe added: “The goal is to make good nutrition possible for all. The healthier we can keep everybody in this country, the lower our health costs will be.”\nIn the 15 years since the heart association last issued dietary guidelines to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, almost nothing has changed for the better. The typical American diet has remained highly processed.\nAmericans consume too much added sugars, artery-clogging fats, refined starches, red meat and salt and don’t eat enough nutrient-rich vegetables, fruits, nuts, beans and whole grains that can help prevent heart disease, diabetes and cancer.\nBut rather than become discouraged, the association decided to try a different approach.\nFor too long, nutrition advice has been overly focused on individual nutrients and ingredients, Alice H Lichtenstein, the guidelines’ chief author, told me, and it hasn’t been focused enough on overall dietary patterns that can best fit people’s lives and budgets.\nHOW THE GUIDELINES WORK\xa0\nSo instead of a laundry list of “thou shalt not eats,” Dr\xa0Lichtenstein said, the association’s committee on nutrition and cardiovascular disease chose to promote heart-healthy dietary patterns that could suit a wide range of tastes and eating habits.\nIn avoiding “no noes” and dietary revolutions, the new guidelines can foster gradual evolutionary changes meant to last a lifetime.\nThe committee recognised that for people to adopt and stick to a wholesome dietary pattern, it should accommodate personal likes and dislikes, ethnic and cultural practices and life circumstances, and it should consider whether most meals are consumed at home or on the go.\nFor example, rather than urging people to skip pasta because it’s a refined carbohydrate, a more effective message might be to tell people to eat it the traditional Italian way, as a small first-course portion.\nOr, if pasta is your main course, choose a product made from an unrefined carbohydrate like whole wheat, brown rice or lentils.\n“We’re talking about lifelong changes that incorporate personal preferences, culinary traditions and what’s available where people shop and eat,” said Dr. Lichtenstein, a professor of nutrition science and policy at the Friedman School at Tufts University.\n“The advice is evidence-based and applies to everything people eat regardless of where the food is procured, prepared and consumed.”\nThe guidelines’ first principle is to adjust one’s “energy intake and expenditure” to “achieve and maintain a healthy body weight,” a recommendation that may be easier to follow with the next two principles: Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, and choose foods made mostly with whole grains rather than refined grains.\nA HEALTHY DIET FOR YOU AND THE PLANET\xa0\nIf cost or availability is an issue, as is the case in many of the country’s food deserts where fresh produce is scarce, Dr Lichtenstein suggested keeping bags of frozen fruits and vegetables on hand to reduce waste, add convenience and save money.\nSome wholesome protein choices that the committee recommended included fish and seafood (although not breaded and fried), legumes and nuts, and low-fat or fat-free dairy products.\nIf meat is desired, choose lean cuts and refrain from processed meats like sausages, hot dogs and deli meats that are high in salt and saturated fat.\nThe committee’s advice on protein foods, published during the climate talks in Glasgow, was well-timed. Choosing plant-based proteins over animal sources of protein not only has health value for consumers but can help to foster a healthier planet.\nExperts have long known that animal products like beef, lamb, pork and veal have a disproportionately negative impact on the environment. Raising animals requires more water and land and generates more greenhouse gases than growing protein-rich plants does.\n“This is a win-win for individuals and our environment,” Dr Lichtenstein said.\nHowever, she cautioned, if a plant-based diet is overloaded with refined carbohydrates and sugars, it will raise the risk of Type 2 diabetes and heart disease.\nAnd she discouraged relying on popular plant-based meat alternatives that are ultra-processed and often high in sodium, unhealthy fats and calories, and that “may not be ecologically sound to produce.”\nTo protect both the environment and human health, the committee advised shifting one’s diet away from tropical oils – coconut, palm and palm kernel\xa0– as well as animal fats (butter and lard) and partially hydrogenated fats (read the nutrition label).\nInstead, use liquid plant oils like corn, soybean, safflower, sunflower, canola, nut and olive. They have been shown to lower the risk of cardiovascular disease by about 30 percent, an effect comparable to taking a statin drug.\nAs for beverages, the committee endorsed the current national dietary guideline to avoid drinks with added sugars (including honey and concentrated fruit juice). If you don’t currently drink alcohol, the committee advised against starting; for those who do drink, limit consumption to one to two drinks a day.\nPREVENTION IS KEY\nAll told, the dietary patterns that the committee outlined can go far beyond reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases like heart attacks and strokes.\nThey can also protect against Type 2 diabetes and a decline of kidney function, and perhaps even help foster better cognitive abilities and a slower rate of age-related cognitive decline.\nThe earlier in life a wholesome dietary pattern begins, the better, Dr Lichtenstein said. “It should start preconception, not after someone has a heart attack, and reinforced through nutrition education in school, from Kindergarten\xa0through 12th Grade.”\nAnd during annual checkups, Dr Eckel said, primary care doctors should devote three to five minutes of the visit to a lifestyle interview, asking patients how many servings of fruits, vegetables and whole grains they consume and whether they read nutrition labels.\nBy Jane E.

      Malaysia government to hold sales for basic necessities to help check price hikes: Minister
  </h1>, 'text': 'KUALA LUMPUR: The Malaysian government will be holding regular sales of basic goods as part of the efforts to keep prices of necessities affordable to consumers, Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Minister Alexander Nanta Linggi told parliament on Tuesday (Nov 30).\nSpeaking during question time, Mr Nanta said that the government will organise the ""Keluarga Malaysia"" (Malaysian Family) sales twice a month starting from this Saturday.\n“The ministry will ensure that the prices of the goods sold will be cheaper than the market, by 15 to 20 per cent,"" he said, adding that the sales would be held in all 222 parliamentary constituencies.\nHe was responding to a question by former finance minister Lim Guan Eng and opposition MP for Bagan about actions to contain the rising prices of goods.\nMr Nanta said that other government agencies and departments would also cooperate with his ministry to ensure that the sales of these basic necessities would reach households affected by the price increases.\nCurrently, the ministry had over 1,000 price monitoring officers roving daily to check the prices of 480 items in 1,500 premises nationwide, to ensure that price rises occurred reasonably.\xa0\nThe ministry would also activate the Festive Season Maximum Price Control Scheme earlier in December as Christmas was approaching.\nMr Nanta\xa0said the date for the festive price control scheme would be announced very soon, and warned traders not to take advantage by raising their prices early before the scheme’s announcement.\nHowever, Lim said the minister should not have blamed traders alone as the price increases were a result of supply and demand.\n“A few associations now have stated that vegetables’ prices are now more expensive than meat, with the price of\xa0chillies now RM20 (per kg). Where has this ever been seen before,” Lim noted.\nHe proposed that a fund could be formed using the government’s windfall tax money, to assist farmers or traders in reducing costs.\xa0\nMeanwhile, Mr Nanta said that the Agriculture and Food Industry Ministry (MAFI) was also drafting a strategy following discussion between the ministry and industry players.\nSome proposals included permitting import of chickens from approved processing plants overseas, as a temporary solution to increase supply and stabilise the market.\n“The prime minister has also announced an assistance plan\xa0totalling RM262 million (US$62 million) to assist farmers affected by the increased fertiliser and pesticide costs,” Mr Nanta noted.\nRM200 million from the assistance fund, he said, was to be set aside as an agro-food, zero-interest loan with a six-month repayment moratorium for producers.\xa0\nRISING FOOD PRICES A\xa0“NATIONAL CRISIS”: ANWAR IBRAHIM\xa0\nDuring the debate, opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim\xa0also took issue with Mr Nanta on the government’s response to the rising price hikes of essential goods.\nMr Anwar called on Putrajaya to act fast as the rising prices for food supplies had become a “national crisis” and a burden for consumers.\nAt another event during his tour of the Selangor Agricultural Development Corporation’s (PKPS) stalls in Shah Alam, Mr Anwar said in situations like the current price hikes, federal agencies should be making their rounds to assist the farmers.\n“They should go down (to the ground) to reduce the burden, bring out (produce) from the farms, so the farmers can get a better price, while also reducing prices for the consumer,” he said.\xa0\nMr Anwar also praised the PKPS’ Fruit Valley initiative, which managed to keep the cost of its fresh produce low and expressed his hope that other state governments and the federal agencies could follow its example.\xa0\nOn Nov 23, the Consumer Association of Penang (CAP) had published a list showing how much vegetable prices had soared, calling for government authorities to step in to bring down the sharp price hikes.\nFollowing public outcry, Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Deputy Minister Rosol Wahid told parliament last week that investigations by his ministry\xa0 discovered that the price increases were not as dramatic as claimed by CAP.\nVegetable farmers associations interviewed by CNA said that prices of some agricultural produce had increased between 30-40 per cent recently.\nThey said beside the heavier-than-usual monsoon season, the lack of labour and increase in farming production cost had affected harvests and food supply.\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     Malaysia ', '     food ', '     Anwar Ibrahim ', '     Lim Guan Eng ']}"

      Price hike of vegetables in Malaysia due to weather, labour shortage and production costs, say farmers
  </h1>, 'text': 'KUALA LUMPUR: Prices of vegetables in Malaysia have increased between 30 and\xa040\xa0per cent recently, and the contributing factors included a heavier-than-usual monsoon season, labour shortage and higher production cost, said industry players interviewed by CNA.\nAccording to the Cameron Highlands Vegetable Growers Association, vegetable prices would normally rise around the end of the year, as vegetable production activities are impacted by the monsoon season.\n“The heavy rains simply make it unsuitable for vegetables to grow. The fertiliser are washed away and the roots are exposed, the extra moisture makes them susceptible to rot,\xa0and they do not get enough sunshine to grow,“ the association’s secretary Chay Ee Mong told CNA.\nHe said the vegetable farmers also faced other problems this time round, including shortage of workers to help in the planting and harvesting.\nCameron Highlands vegetable farms rely heavily on foreign workers and many of them had returned to their home countries due to the COVID-19 pandemic since last year, said Mr Chay.\nMoreover, the government’s decision to freeze foreign labour hiring from June 2020 meant that farms could not hire new foreigners.\nSome foreign workers whose work passes expired chose to leave the country, Mr Chay said.\nHe said that the farmers also faced the problem of rising costs for agricultural inputs such as fertilisers and farming implements including geotextiles and weather protection structures.\n“For example, we buy our plant fertiliser where we can find the cheapest, but did you know that a tonne of urea fertiliser, which used to cost just below RM1,000 (US$235), is now selling for RM4,000?” Mr Chay said.\nThe supply chain issues due to the pandemic which impacted international shipping and logistics had disrupted the delivery and availability of fertilisers and farming implements, added Mr Chay.\nPresident of the Federation of Vegetable Farmers\xa0Association Lim Ser Kwee noted that prices for vegetables had been increasing, but the hikes had been particularly acute this yearend.\nThe prices of chillies, he told CNA, had gone up from RM7 per kg to RM10. Last week, the price even hit RM20 per kg.\xa0\nThe prices of broccoli had also doubled from the initial RM8 per kg, he said.\n“Honestly, vegetable prices are like share prices. There are rises and drops, but overall, prices have increased about 30 and\xa040 per cent,” Mr Lim, who operates a\xa0vegetable farm in Simpang Renggam, Johor, said.\xa0\xa0\nPreviously, Malaysia could import items such as Indonesian round cabbage to fulfil market demand.\n“You could buy one head for about RM0.50, and it would arrive within a week, and once it cleared customs, you could sell it for RM1. You could still make money.\n“But with the disrupted shipping, two weeks and you still might not see your vegetable order,” he said.\nAbout 40 per cent of Johor’s vegetable produce are exported to Singapore, Mr Lim said, although he was unsure of the total tonnage.\n“We cannot be sure of the exact tonnage, because the growers might have contracts to supply retailers individually, or they send their produce to the Pasir Panjang wholesale market.\n“But I have been informed by members that exports have fallen by about 20 to 30 per cent (due to lower vegetable output). And it is impossible that if prices have increased here, they will not increase in Singapore,” he added.\xa0\nMalaysia is a net importer of foodstuffs, including vegetables, with items such as chillies, round cabbage and lettuce being brought in to help make up for the shortfall in local production.\nData from Malaysia’s Department of Statistics (DOSM) showed\xa0that the country imported up to RM55.5 billion in agricultural commodities in 2020, up from RM51.46 billion the year before.\xa0\nINVESTIGATE PRICE INCREASES: PENANG CONSUMER ASSOCIATION\xa0\xa0\nThe increase in vegetable prices has sparked public concern, with the Consumer Association of Penang (CAP) publishing a list\xa0showing how much the vegetable prices have soared.\xa0\nIn a Facebook post on Nov 23, CAP’s president Mohideen Abdul Kader called on the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry and the Federal Agricultural Marketing Authority (FAMA) to take immediate steps to bring down vegetable prices which it said had risen sharply in the past two weeks.\nCAP claimed that items such as broccoli, which is commonly imported, had gone up from RM8 to RM20 per kg, while choy sum had increased to RM9 from RM3 per kg.\xa0\nPrices for red chillies\xa0had also increased from RM13 to RM19 per kg while the green chillies\xa0had gone up from RM10 to RM14 per kg.\nThe non-governmental organisation also called on the ministry’s enforcement division to investigate the price increases, stating that average income earners would be badly affected by the price escalations.\n“CAP has also been repeatedly calling for FAMA to take control of the marketing and distribution of vegetables in the country, but our calls have fallen on deaf ears,” Mr Mohidden said.\nPRICES NOWHERE AS HIGH AS CLAIMED: DEPUTY MINISTER\nDeputy Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Minister Rosol Wahid\xa0told parliament last week that his ministry had received news of the sharp rise of vegetable prices.\xa0\xa0\nHowever, he said investigations had not turned up any price increases as high as the ones claimed by CAP.\n""Our enforcement officers went to the field to observe based on what had been reported. I was to understand that such information came from CAP.”\n“But when we asked CAP, they could not determine the location, they just said ‘hearsay’. Our officers found there were increases, but nowhere as high (as 200 per cent),” Mr Rosol said.\nDomestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Minister Alexander Nanta Linggi announced on Saturday (Nov 27) that his ministry and the Agriculture and Food Industry Ministry (MAFI) had submitted an assistance plan for the agricultural industry players to the Finance MInistry on Nov 24.\nThis followed feedback from the industry players of their need for financial assistance to reduce operational costs.\n“Any decision regarding financial aid to industry players will be announced by MOF,” Mr Nanta Linggi said as quoted by Bernama.\nMr Nanta Linggi said consumers could also use the ministry’s “Price Catcher” app to get information on prices of essential items.\nThe ministry has also begun investigating reports of hiked-up vegetable prices, with the launch of Ops Pasar (Sayur 2) on Saturday.\nDuring the operation, enforcement officers from the ministry visited different parts of the vegetable distribution networks, including suppliers, wholesalers and retailers to check on vegetable prices.\nMr Rosol, the deputy minister, said a total of 1,000 price monitoring officers were assigned to monitor 1,500 locations daily to review and record market price changes for vegetables.\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     Malaysia ', '     agriculture ', '     food ']}"

      Keeping things simple: A coffee shop in Jakarta’s Chinatown and its 90-year-old success story
  </h1>, 'text': 'JAKARTA: Tucked away in a small, dark alley of Jakarta’s Glodok area lies a hidden gem that can be easily overlooked by anyone passing through. This is due to its rundown structure concealed by many wooden stalls around it.\nDespite its unappealing look, Kopi Es Tak Kie has a long history and a simple recipe for success and\xa0these explain why the coffee shop continues to attract dozens of loyal patrons every day.\xa0\nAs numerous pictures on the coffee shop’s walls can testify, the shop counts among many of its customers famous individuals and politicians including President Joko Widodo and Jakarta’s\xa0Governor Anies Baswedan.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\nFor almost a century Kopi Es Tak Kie has witnessed how the Indonesian capital evolved. But for the coffee shop itself, one thing has always remained the same since it began business: its old-style coffee blends.\xa0\n“I don’t know what keeps people coming. Perhaps the coffee suits them, so they keep coming,” said 71-year-old Latif Yulus, who runs the shop with three of his siblings.\nThe third-generation owner said the shop makes its beverage out of ground coffee and no other additional flavours, unlike the new inventions of coffee chains.\nKopi Es Tak Kie was started\xa0in 1927 by Yulus’ grandfather Liong Kwie Tjong, an immigrant from China.\nHe set up his coffee stall or warung kopi as it is called in Indonesia with a cart around Glodok market, which is now famously known as Jakarta’s Chinatown.\xa0\nHaving started from a humble beginning, Liong Kwie Tjong decided to name his coffee Tak Kie. Yulus said ""tak"" suggests a wise, prudent and modest person, while “kie” means familiar or fondly remembered.\xa0\n“So Tak Kie is a modest person who is simple and if the person departs, he or she is fondly remembered for his simplicity.\n“It could be the simplicity of his behaviour or clothes,” said Yulus.\nLiong Kwie Tjong\'s son Liong Tjoen, who is Yulus’ father, later took over the business and started serving fresh coffee from the alley in Glodok, which is often called Gloria alley.\xa0\xa0\nSimplicity seems to be the coffee shop’s secret recipe for success.\xa0\nWhile many coffee shops nowadays serve a variety of coffee flavours, Kopi Es Tak Kie only offers black coffee and milk coffee.\nBoth can be served hot or cold, priced at 20,000 rupiah (US$1.40) for a cup of black coffee and 22,000 rupiah for milk coffee.\nLongtime\xa0customer Penny Liauw, 56, says her favourite is\xa0iced milk coffee.\n“It tastes different, not like the average coffee. I once asked them how they make their coffee.\xa0\n“They said they blend it in the morning, and if they run out of it, that’s it,” said Liauw who has frequented the cafe for about 12 years.\nHer husband, who used to live around the neighbourhood, was the one who introduced her to Kopi Es Tak Kie and now she visits it almost every day when she is not out of town.\xa0\nApart from coffee, the shop also serves other dishes such as chicken noodle, meatball, nasi tim (steam rice) chicken and nasi campur (rice with pork).\xa0\nFor 30,000 rupiah, the chicken noodle is also Liauw’s favourite dish.\xa0\nAnother patron, who only wants to be known as Iwan, has been frequenting the coffee shop for more than 10 years to seek his favourite nasi campur and a cup of hot black coffee.\n“It’s delicious. Everything is just in the right quantity and they all blend well,” says Iwan, who is in his 50s.\xa0\xa0\nYulus, the owner, said that his regular customers include both Muslims and non-Muslims.\nFor whatever dishes they choose, many of the customers usually opt for Tak Kie’s special brew of coffee to go along with them.\nAccording to Yulus, his shop only uses coffee beans from Lampung, Sumatra. They make their coffee only once in the morning.\nThe shop opens daily as soon as the coffee is ready at around 6am or 7am, and closes at 2pm since there are not many customers in the afternoon.\nUsually,\xa0the coffee runs out by midday. After that, customers patrons have to satisfy themselves with a cup of tea or teh tarik (hot tea with milk). \nAmong those who had to make do with Tak Kie’s tea servings\xa0were\xa0civil servant Bambang Wahyudi and his colleague Iwan Gunawan.\xa0\nThey only managed to get to the shop after the Friday noon’s Muslim\xa0prayers.\xa0\n“We decided to drop by because Mr Anies once visited this place,” said Wahyudi, referring to the city governor.\n“I first didn’t realise this is the place because I thought the cafe he visited was in the Old Town. But my friend said this is the place. So, I thought: ‘Let’s go.’ It was just a coincidence,” added Wahyudi.\xa0\xa0\n“My first impression is,\xa0\'Wow, this place is so old ...\xa0And everything seems untidy.\' But perhaps that is by design to make it unique,” said the 54-year-old while pointing at the\xa0rusty ceiling fans.\nHis friend Gunawan said that he had long thought about visiting the place as he had seen many friends posting pictures of it on Instagram.\nGunawan was glad to make his first visit to the shop though he just missed having a taste of its famous coffee.\xa0\nHe will definitely return to have a taste of Tak Kie’s coffee.\nBaswedan\xa0is not the only Jakarta governor who has visited the\xa0coffee shop.\nJokowi, as the president is popularly known, had\xa0made several visits before he was elected as the head of state. He\xa0first visited the shop when he was running for governor of Jakarta, and then again when he was the city’s governor in 2013.\xa0\nJokowi said that his favourite drink was iced black coffee.\xa0\nPictures of Jokowi, Baswedan, former Jakarta deputy governor Sandiaga Uno who is now tourism minister as well as a few other famous people visiting the diner adorn the walls of the shop. \nHaving famous guests dropping by surely is a magnet\xa0that helps Kopi Es Tak Kie maintain its appeal.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\nShop owner Yulus said there is another ingredient for success.\xa0“We try to maintain our quality and always behave politely. If we are grumpy, nobody wants to come.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     Indonesia ', '     Jakarta ', '     food ', '     business ']}"

      IN FOCUS: Will changing what we eat help save the planet?
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Since getting married and moving into her new home with her husband, Ms Noor Hanisah Noordin has been making efforts to reduce how much meat she eats.\nShe is in charge of the cooking\xa0and prepares vegetarian meals most days of the week. This is a departure from when she lived with her family when almost every meal would have some meat.\nThe reason for this change is not due to changing taste preferences or a desire for a healthier diet.\nIt’s because of environmental concerns.\n“It’s important to me to treat our environment in the best way. This is especially so because of the climate crisis that indicates we have been harming it massively,” said the 28-year-old who is part of the Singapore Youth for Climate Action.\nWhile much of the attention about the environmental damage being done to the planet has focused on areas such as the use of fossil fuels and plastics, food production and consumption is an issue that is increasingly in the spotlight.\nOf all the staples on many people’s dinner table, experts say that red meat is the worst culprit causing environmental harm.\n“On the relative scale, producing certain amounts of red meats has 10 to 100 times greater impact on the environment than producing the same amount of plant-based foods,” said Professor William Chen, director of the Food Science and Technology Programme at Nanyang Technological University (NTU).\nMs Hanisah’s journey to eating less meat started when she browsed a book at a prata stall in Jalan Kayu, which highlighted how food production and consumption has a major impact on the environment.\n“It made a lot of sense because food is such a big part of your life,” she said.\nGreenhouse gas emissions from food production make up more than a third of the global total, studies have shown.\nSuch emissions are an indicator used to measure the amount of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere due to human activities. These gases cause the greenhouse effect that lead to global heating. Such warming leads to other issues like melting glaciers,\xa0rising sea levels and intensification of extreme weather events.\xa0\nProf Chen, who is also Michael Fam chair professor at NTU, cited some figures to show how food production dominates the environment. For instance, 40 per cent of water is used for agriculture and a third of all crop land is used to produce animal feed.\n“The food we eat therefore is closely related to the environment,” he said.\xa0\nBut not all food production has the same impact.\nAssociate Professor L. Roman Carrasco, assistant head of the Department Biological Sciences, at National University of Singapore (NUS) said that when it comes to environmental harm, “the worst by far are beef and lamb”. \n“Their contributions to climate change and biodiversity loss are staggering. More than half of the emissions from food come from animal products and, among all of them, half of the emissions are just from beef and lamb,” he said.\nWhile livestock farming has the worst carbon footprint, sugarcane and coffee are among the most harmful crops on the environment because their production can involve destroying biodiversity and causing soil erosion, Prof Chen said.\n“Other surprises include … rice paddy fields which emit more greenhouse gases than other cereals, as well as soybean farming,” he said. \nThe situation for Singapore is somewhat different because the country is so reliant on food imports, which means that the environmental cost of bringing supplies in to the country has a comparatively greater impact.\nA Singapore-centric study commissioned by investment firm Temasek and carried out by the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) and Deloitte, looked at the environmental impact of food items in terms of greenhouse gas emission, energy consumption and water consumption. The study looked at the life cycle of food, from the time it is produced, processed and transported then consumed.\xa0\nThe study, published in 2019, was commissioned to provide insights into the situation here as many existing studies are centred on the United States or Europe and do not consider the environmental effects of importing food.\nIt found that in the context of Singapore, which imports more than 90 per cent of its food, transportation plays an important role in contributing to greenhouse gas emissions compared with many other countries where food can be produced locally.\xa0\nThe level of consumption also made a difference. In this context, pork has a bigger impact than beef.\nPork accounts for the most greenhouse gas\xa0emissions per annum per capita\xa0despite the fact that greenhouse gas emissions from one kilogram of pork is half that of one kilogram of beef, the study found.\n""This is because per capita consumption of pork is much greater than that of beef,"" the study said.\nAccording to the study, the annual greenhouse gas emissions per capita basis, with carbon dioxide equivalent as a unit of measurement for chicken is 121kg and 97kg for fish - both higher than that for beef, which stood at 69kg.\xa0\nBeef has the highest greenhouse gas emissions on a per kg basis, but has relatively low greenhouse gas emissions on a per capita basis due to low consumption, the study found.\nOn a per capita\xa0basis, pork came out tops, at 266kg, while leafy vegetables like spinach, lettuce and Chinese cabbage ranked the lowest, at 6kg.\nIn order to reduce the environmental impact of key staples, their country of origin and proximity to Singapore becomes a factor, along with how they are transported.\nThe greenhouse gas\xa0emissions during the transportation stage for food imported from Brazil are about 45 times more when flying in the chilled meat than shipping it frozen through sea freight, the study found, adding that a\xa0similar comparison can be seen for chilled and frozen pork from Australia.\n""Hence, sourcing chilled food items from neighbouring countries or producing locally can serve to meaningfully reduce the environmental footprint as this means avoiding the need to import food through air transport,"" the study said.\nThe study also said that at the time, 29 per cent of the average Singaporean’s diet consists of meats, eggs and seafood. The study noted that meat products such as pork have significantly higher greenhouse gas than fruits and vegetables.\xa0\nThis means that there are other options to reduce the environmental impact of food production and consumption.\nNoting the availability\xa0of plant-based alternatives to meat in Singapore, the study said: ""Consuming less traditional meat and more of these plant-based meats could lead to a significant decrease\xa0in the greenhouse gas emissions of our food supply due to the lower environmental footprint of plant sources.""\nSuch studies come against a backdrop of growing public awareness globally of how food production is tied to environmental damage and discussion about how individuals can make a difference.\xa0\nMs Hanisah has reduced the amount of seafood and chicken that she eats.\n“When it comes to seafood, you\'re not sure if they\'re beings over-fished, if they\'re being farmed. I don\'t want to be overtaking from the environment and not giving back,” she said.\n“I think also because that all (seafood and chicken) add up carbon footprint-wise. Definitely, the resources you need to produce that is more than vegetables,” she said.\nChanging food consumptionhabits would help the environment “tremendously”, Assoc Prof Carrasco said.\n“For instance, if we were all vegan, food production emissions would drop by 70 per cent,” he said. \nReferring to the study done by his agency with Deloitte, Dr Jonathan Low from A*Star said that having a more balanced diet and substituting 50 per cent of animal-based red meats with plant-based alternatives could reduce food greenhouse gas emissions by more than 25 per cent.\nBeyond individuals’ consumption, farming needs to transform, gradually moving away from industrialised agriculture to sustainable agriculture, Prof Chen said. The key is sustainability of food production, he said, adding that changes towards an efficient agricultural system are needed. \n“Promoting sustainable livestock farming, which involves sustainable feeds, higher production yield, and better manure utilisation, is a critical step forward,” he said.\nAlternative food sources may become increasingly important, considering the impact of climate change on traditional farming, he added.\nWhile individuals can do their part, restaurants are also taking steps to help protect the environment. Mexican-Turkish restaurant chain Stuff’d\xa0temporarily replaced its beef with a plant-based alternative in a recent collaboration with Impossible Foods, which makes such products. \nThe price will remain the same, said the chain’s regional business development manager Jason Tan. Stuff’d started offering Impossible beef on its menu in 2019, but price was a concern to some customers, Mr Tan said.\n“Conventional beef was still the more affordable option when viewed alongside Impossible beef, creating a psychological price barrier for some who want to eat more sustainably,” he said. \nMr Tan added that the firm saw a rising consumption trend for plant-based diets and healthy food in Singapore, especially among the younger generation.\nGeneral Manager of Impossible Foods Singapore Laurent Stevenart\xa0said that the firm’s beef alternative uses 87 per cent less water, needs 96 per cent less land, contributes 89 per cent less greenhouse gas emissions, and contributes 92 per cent less freshwater pollution than conventional beef.\n“We hope that this three-month collaboration campaign with Impossible Foods drives further awareness and acceptance of plant-based protein and encourages and convinces a wider audience to play their part in eating more sustainably,” Mr Tan said.\nAt another restaurant, Open Farm Community, many products are grown by the restaurant itself, or sourced locally, said its head chef Olvier Truesdale-Jutras.\nIf products are sourced overseas, the team looks out for ethical environmental practices, he said. \n“Anything we can grow ourselves cuts out the whole chain of middlemen, packaging, shipping, and so on. Sourcing locally drops the emissions massively and supports the local financial ecosystem,” he said.\nIf it\'s protein, the restaurant ensures that it is carbon-neutral from the source, Mr Truesdale-Jutras said.\xa0 \n“We work with three Australian farms committed to their own carbon neutrality for our non-vegetable options, and support local fish and chicken farmers as much as possible,” he said.\nCarbon-neutral means that any carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere from a company’s activities is balanced by an equivalent amount being removed.\nWhile most food and beverage operations keep food in excess to cater to the unpredictable demand for dishes from customers,\xa0his restaurant does not do this, he said.\n“We would rather change the dish if we run out and use up something else from our own farm or garden than over order and sit on expensive and environmentally irresponsible amounts of product”, he said.\nOpen Farm Community also minimises waste by using “absolutely everything” and composting the rest, Mr Truesdale-Jutras said.\n“We spend a fair amount of time and creative effort ensuring we avoid extraneous food waste. Things that usually get binned get re-purposed into tasty edibles or infusions,” he said. HOW CAN PEOPLE MAKE A CHANGE?\nPeople can help save the environment by taking other steps, experts said. \nThe environmental impact of a certain food item or ingredient could vary when produced using different methods and in different countries, said Dr Low, who is the acting research division director of the Sustainability and Life Cycle Engineering Division at A*Star’s Singapore Institute of Manufacturing Technology.\n“We can choose to buy the one produced in the most sustainable manner,” he said. Food producers and supermarkets could provide\xa0information, through environmental labels\xa0for instance, to help consumers make informed choices, Dr Low added.\xa0They could also implement sustainable procurement initiatives, he said.\xa0\n“Do not waste food. Food wastage means the environmental impact caused by food production was for nothing,” he said, adding that the treatment and decomposition of food waste is estimated to contribute to an additional one-eighth of global greenhouse gas emissions.\nSimilarly, Prof Chen said the one of the easiest changes people can introduce to their eating habits is to reduce food waste.\n“One way to help save the planet is to encourage responsible consumption through consumer education,” he said. Another way is help develop alternative food sources, he said. Urban farming provides a viable option for food source in cities, he said. \n“Getting more Singaporeans involved in the community-scale urban farming also helps raising awareness of preciousness of foods and thus naturally inculcate responsible consumption behaviour,” he said. \nDecisions including what kind of foods and how much people eat play a major role for both health and environment sustainability. For this reason, gradually moving toward more intake of healthier foods should certainly improve environmental sustainability, he said. \nAssoc Prof Carrasco referred to reducing food waste as the “lowest hanging fruit” for people to make an impact.\n“We need not be so drastic to have an impact. The best changes are those that do not represent a major effort and can be sustained over time,” he said.\nGetting the portions right and managing the fridge well, not only would save people money, but could cut global carbon emissions by 8 per cent, he added.\n“We can have a profound impact with a few decisions that need not be drastic (reducing food waste and eating less beef and lamb). The good news is that those decisions align our health, our pockets and the planet’s health. Everybody wins, “he said. \n', 'related_topics': ['     In Focus ', '     climate change ', '     greenhouse gas ', '     food ']}"

      Commentary: Why food shouldn't be left to pile up in fridges and go to waste
  </h1>, 'text': 'ABERYSTWYTH, Wales: When people think about ways to help the environment, encourage biodiversity and decrease greenhouse gases, they don’t usually think about the impact of food waste.\nAnd yet food waste is responsible for up to 10 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Producing food for a growing global population is a complex challenge with a lot of negative environmental consequences, so food waste creates unnecessary strain on our fragile environment.\nI was part of a recent research project with the UK Global Food Security programme, which explores ways to cut food waste.\nOur key findings and suggestions address waste throughout the food system – that includes all the processes, people and infrastructure involved in getting food from farm to fork.\nWe found that cutting food waste needs cooperative action from all of us – businesses, policymakers and individuals. The most commonly wasted foods are fresh fruit and vegetables, bread and baked goods, and leftovers.\nProducts with short shelf lives, such as meat and dairy, are also prone to be wasted.\nDomestic food waste declined in the UK dramatically during the early pandemic lockdowns, with 30 per cent using up more leftovers, but waste levels are increasing again as people go out more and have less time to cook.\nSet your fridge to below 5 degrees Celsius: This can help increase the shelf life of many of the most commonly wasted foods, including fruit, vegetables and dairy products.\nAbout 90 per cent of milk waste happens in the home – this adds up to nearly 500 million pints annually in the UK. Setting your fridge to the right temperature can save 50,000 tonnes of milk waste every year.\nYet many of us don’t know how to adjust our fridge temperature, or how best to store food.\nWRAP, a charity working on cutting waste, has guidance on understanding and adjusting fridge temperatures, and the best ways to stop milk and dairy products being wasted.\nDecrease single-use plastics: Many of us are seeking to decrease the amount of single-use plastics in our lives, and in our shopping baskets. This is good – but often these plastics and packaging keep food fresh for longer.\nFortunately, there are significant developments towards a post-plastic world. Scientists are working on developing methods of treating and storing food that can extend its shelf life.\nFor now, if you’re going to ditch the plastic wrap, make sure you store food in reusable containers in the fridge to maintain freshness.\nDish up smaller portions: This results in up to 20 per cent less food waste If you have leftovers, make sure you enjoy them, and don’t forget about them.\nThe reasons behind domestic food waste are complex. Many of us put our leftovers in the fridge, then forget about them. Fortunately, there are many ways to manage our fridge contents effectively and decrease food waste.\nThese range from apps, to the humble Post-it note, or pen. Labelling leftovers reminds us when they went in – and when they need to be eaten by. Try and freeze meat, dairy and bread if they are close to spoiling – this will extend their life.\nBuy directly from local suppliers: Our food systems and supply chains are incredibly complex. This complexity, as well as contracts which tend to favour larger suppliers, leads to high levels of food loss and waste.\nIn contrast, buying directly from local suppliers results in less waste and keeps money in the local economy. It’s possible to buy almost anything – fruit, veg, bread, meat, dairy - directly from suppliers. Support a local business, eat quality food, and decrease waste.\nHelp out at your local food bank: Suppliers often have awkward quantities of fresh food that is damaged and can’t be sold.\nThey are more than happy to get this to a local group that prepares meals or distributes extra food surplus directly to the public – and apps like Too Good To Go are helping restaurants in the UK to do this.\nBut logistical challenges – and costs – mean that this food often still goes to waste. Food banks often have an excess of tinned and processed food – and a limited amount of fresh food available for people who need it.\nLet your local redistribution hub know that you’re available to help pick up some spare food and transport it to a nearby redistribution centre.\nFood waste is a complex problem that won’t be solved by individual actions alone. Supermarkets are rising to the challenge of shrinking their environmental footprint. \nBut we all need to do what we can to decrease food loss and waste, at the household level and beyond.\nSiobhan Maderson is a research fellow and associate lecturer at the University of Aberystwyth.

      Meaty opportunities for alternative proteins in Asia
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: It seems people around the world can’t get enough of protein.\nIn Asia, the consumption of meat and seafood is expected to increase 78 per cent by 2050, according to a report by Singapore-based consultancy\xa0Asia\xa0Research and Engagement.\nWith the meat and dairy industries already accounting for about 14.5 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions, such growth will have serious consequences for the fight against climate change.\nOne solution to this impending crisis is alternative proteins, and businesses have been quick to capitalise on the potential in the sector.\nAccording to Barclays, the alternative meat sector accounted for about 1 per cent of the global US$1.4 trillion meat industry in 2019. But this is expected to rise to 10 per cent by the end of the decade, to an estimated total of US$140 billion.\nAsia is likely to drive much of that growth. In China alone, the plant-based meat market is already a third larger than that in the United States.\nAccording to the Good Food Institute, plant-based meat, egg and dairy companies enjoyed a major share in a record investment year.\nThe Good Food Institute is a non-profit supporting the alternative protein ecosystem.\nIn 2020, investors looking for sustainable alternatives to animal protein pumped in US$3.1 billion, according to Good Food Institute.\nThat is three times the amount for 2019 and half the entire investment raised in an entire decade (US$5.9 billion between 2010 and 2020).\nGood Food Institute Asia Pacific\'s acting managing director Mirte Gosker said the most successful food techs were founded a decade ago in the United States.\nThese businesses now have a track record in the bio-mimicking of meat.\nIn Asia, more start-ups are being established, with the aim of creating similar products, which cater to local palates.\nOne such start-up is Hong Kong-based Avant Meats. It is angling its cell-based foods to the tastebuds of its Asian customers.\nIt came up with lab-grown fish fillets, using the cells of real fish. Seed funding of more than US$3 million is helping the development of a new product – fish maw, grown in a lab.\nFish maw is a traditional Chinese delicacy – and the premium varieties can cost thousands of dollars per kilogramme.\xa0\n""We would like to work on a product that resonate and emotionally connect with consumers in this part of the world, Asia. So that’s why we picked a very traditional culinary ingredient to work on,"" said Ms Carrie Chan,\xa0Avant\'s co-founder and CEO.\nShe pointed out that cultivated meat development uses technology from the medical sector, meaning that the equipment and material costs are high.\nThe need for such high initial investment means that when new alternative proteins are first introduced to consumer markets, their asking prices often exceed those of the conventional products.\n""So we think about something that we can start selling which is conventionally relatively a little bit more expensive so that we can reach price parity a little bit earlier,"" said Ms Chan.\nElsewhere, other entrepreneurs are tapping into Asia’s rich heritage of plant-based dishes to give consumers new options.\nSuch foods particularly appeal to consumers who may prefer simple foods, which only have a short list of ingredients.\nOne such entrepreneur is Ms Angeline Leong, the founder of Angie’s Tempeh.\nShe started making her own fermented soybean cakes, because she couldn’t find many vegetarian protein sources.\nTo learn more, she went to the home of tempeh in Java, Indonesia. That’s when she found out that what is traditional and artisanal, does not always scale up well.\n""It’s not possible to import that kind of technique directly to Singapore because first of all, we have space constraints and maybe manpower constraints, so that’s why we had to come up with new processes entirely from ourselves,"" said Ms Leong.\nIt took a year of experimentation, as well as investment in custom-made machinery.\nThe company now makes five different types of tempeh. On top of the traditional soybean, it also uses chickpeas, quinoa, buckwheat, azuki beans and millet.\n""What we really have in mind is Asian flavours, because we realise that currently in the alternative meat market, many of the products are mainly focused with western taste,"" said Ms Leong.\n""We want to focus on the Asian palate, like what people in Singapore and the rest of Asia like to eat,"" she added.\xa0\nThe start-up has received US$200,000 in venture funding, which will be used for research and development, and for scaling up to supply mainstream supermarkets.\nThe company, which also sells tempeh bak kwa, is hoping to serve up more new products such as tempeh nuggets.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Money Mind ', '     alternative protein ', '     food ']}"

  </h1>, 'text': 'BEIJING: Older residents in Beijing recently stocked up on cabbage, giving a tradition a new lease of life after the government advised people to keep enough basic goods at home in case of emergencies.\nPeople have for years bought up dozens of large cabbages, which can be kept fresh for months and are widely used in local cuisine, in early November to see them through freezing winters.\nA government notice\xa0issued last Monday (Nov 1) advising households to stock up on daily necessities and a snow forecast reinforced the rush this year, with long early morning queues forming outside supermarkets in downtown Beijing last week.\n""Every year at this time the (cabbage) sales volume is high.

      A 60-year-old KL bakery rides out COVID-19 with old-school cakes, but continuity is an issue
  </h1>, 'text': 'KUALA LUMPUR: The atmosphere was quiet but busy at Chen Tiang Cake House as the bakers concentrated on the morning pastry rush.\xa0\nWorking quickly, they kneaded the dough, divided it into smaller portions and spooned in fillings from kaya spread to desiccated coconut.\xa0\nEach tray of pastry was placed in a 2m-high stacking trolley and wheeled into a proofing chamber for the dough to rest before baking.\xa0\nAt the storefront, Han Phei Yee, daughter of the bakery’s late owner Han Yooi Kong, attended to walk-in customers as well as enquiries and bookings over the phone.\xa0\nThe cake house, located along the busy Jalan Sungai Besi in Kuala Lumpur’s Pudu area, has been in business since the late proprietor first began selling cakes in 1961 in a stall next to its present location.\xa0\nDespite the emergence of modern bakeries and dessert shops, as well as new tastes and trends in the Klang Valley’s food scene, Chen Tiang Cake House has somehow withstood the test of time for 60 years.\xa0\nWhile the bakery is doing its best to weather COVID-19’s impact, this pandemic has also inspired the bakery to bring back a slice of nostalgia for younger consumers in the form of mini pieces of cakes.\nThis has proven to be the right move during the pandemic, with these snack-size offerings a hit among the shop’s customers, both old and young.\xa0\nHaving been through it all, the late owner’s wife Wang Ying, 75, said it was very difficult to just let the bakery go, as she held a lot of deep emotions for the business.\xa0\nBetween the COVID-19 pandemic and the Asian financial crisis back in 1997 and 1998, she felt the latter was much tougher.\xa0\n“At that time the economy was very bad, until even my husband had thoughts about giving up on the business.”\n“But in the end, we said, ‘We have always been in this line, if we do not do this, what else can we do?’”\xa0\nOver the years, Chen Tiang has kept its original store layout and equipment to produce its baked goods.\xa0\n“All the equipment you see here, including the mixers, were all passed down from my late father, and we have been using them for more than 50 years,” said Han.\xa0\nThat is not to say that Chen Tiang has refused to change, she said, but the goal was to preserve the traditional taste.\xa0\n“As you can see, most of our employees are elderly, and they refuse to get rid of the equipment.\n“Even our tiles are the same since the beginning!” she said.\xa0\nAt the height of Chen Tiang’s business from the 1980s to the 1990s, the shop had 10 employees.\n“In the 1980s, there were a lot of changes, that’s when styles like Black Forest, blueberry and others became popular.”\n“We didn’t know how to make them at first, so it was like starting over again, but business was very good. That was the trend at that time,” Wang Ying said.\xa0\nThese days, however, Chen Tiang aims to distinguish itself from other bakeries and cake shops in the Klang Valley by focusing on traditional cakes and pastries.\n“We still do siew pao, curry puffs, apple pie and so on, and everything is handmade by my ‘sifu’ (chef), my mom and my aunt,” Han said.\nThe bakery used to sell sandwich cake slices - two layers of sponge cake with a layer of cream in between and cream decoration piped on top - which were popular for wedding banquets and tea parties.\nThe buttercream came in different flavours from coffee and chocolate to more local ones like pandan, with dabs of jelly providing contrasting colours and tastes.\xa0\xa0\nThe line was discontinued three years ago as these cakes were considered “old fashioned”, said Han. But when the pandemic hit, they decided to bring these cakes back.\xa0\n“We wanted to re-attract our old customers, and at the same time, let the younger generation know we are still selling these ‘old-school’ cakes.”\n“So we discussed it with our chefs, and decided to relaunch the product and shared it on social media,” Han said.\xa0\nThe cakes are made with the bakery’s tried-and-true methods, from mixing the cream and piping the decorative cream on top of the cake slices, mainly done by Wang Ying’s sister Wang Ah Mah.\xa0\nNow, these cake slices are among Chen Tiang’s best sellers.\nHowever, even with the recent renewed interest in its cakes, one worrying prospect is how long the bakery can keep running, as Wang Ying, her sister and the other two employees are already in their golden years.\nFurthermore, certain tasks such as piping the cream decoration freehand are skills which take years to master. Han said it was difficult, if not impossible, to find younger people to take over.\xa0\n“I do not think anyone will have the patience or willingness now to work in an old and stuffy environment, when they can easily find better alternatives out there,” she said.\xa0\n“To be frank, if you were to ask me how long we can retain this business, we really have no idea,” she said.\nAnother aspect is employing modern marketing techniques for Chen Tiang in this social media age.\n“I’m not good with computers, but my daughter and my family encouraged me to use social media and post on Facebook, Instagram to introduce the shop,” Han said.\xa0\nPutting Chen Tiang on food hailing apps is also out of the question as they do not have the speed to produce their handmade goods on a large scale, she added.\nAt the end of the day, as the only sibling who runs the business, Han’s main worry is still about continuing the business.\n“We are worried that 10 years later, will the shop still exist?” she said.\nBut if the shop were to modernise, its offerings would not be authentic anymore, Han said. On top of that, its profit margins were not high and the shop was just able to cover its expenses.\xa0\n“Because our main purpose is to let everyone in the community have a taste of our tradition.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     Malaysia ', '     food ', '     COVID-19 ']}"

      Commentary: Protein shakes and superfoods - is there more hype than actual benefits?
  </h1>, 'text': 'SALEM, Oregon: Do you ever blend up a protein smoothie for breakfast, or grab a protein bar following an afternoon workout? If so, you are likely among the millions of people in search of more protein-rich diets.\nProtein-enriched products are ubiquitous, and these days it seems protein can be infused into anything – even water. But the problem, as\xa0Kristi Wempen, a nutritionist at Mayo Clinic,\xa0points out, is that “contrary to all the hype that everyone needs more protein, most Americans get twice as much as they need.”\nMany of us living in the most economically developed countries are buying into a\xa0myth\xa0of protein deficiency created and perpetuated by food companies and a wide array of self-identified health experts. \nGlobal retail sales of protein supplement products – usually containing a combination of whey, casein or plant-based proteins such as peas, soy or brown rice – reached a\xa0staggering US$18.9 billion in 2020, with the US making up around half of the market.\nEXPERTS WEIGH IN\nWeight-loss surgeon\xa0Garth Davis\xa0writes\xa0in his book Proteinaholic\xa0that “‘eat more protein’ may be the worst advice ‘experts’ give to the public”. Davis contends that most physicians in the US have never actually examined a patient with protein deficiency because simply by eating an adequate number of daily calories we are also most likely getting enough protein.\nIn fact, Americans currently\xa0consume almost two times\xa0the National Academy of Medicine’s recommended daily intake of protein: 56g\xa0for men and 46g\xa0for women – the equivalent of two eggs, a half-cup of nuts and 3 ounces of meat – although optimal protein intake may vary depending on age and activity level.\nFor example, if you’re a dedicated athlete you might need to consume higher quantities of protein. Generally, though,\xa0a 140-pound person should not exceed 120g of protein per day, particularly because a high protein diet can\xa0strain kidney\xa0and\xa0liver function\xa0and increase risks of developing heart disease and cancer.\nWalter Willett, chairman of the department of nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, describes high protein intake as “one of the fundamental processes that increase the risk of cancer.” Beyond these concerns, processed supplements and protein bars are often packed with calories and may contain more sugar than a candy bar.\nAs stated in The New York Times, however, “the protein supplement market is booming among the young and healthy,” those who arguably need it least. The\xa0retail sales of protein products\xa0in the United States were at US$9 billion in 2020,\xa0up from about US$6.6 billion in 2015.\nFats and carbohydrates have, along with sugar, taken turns being vilified since the identification of macronutrients (fats, proteins and carbs) over a century ago. As food writer\xa0Bee Wilson\xa0points out, protein has managed to remain the “last macronutrient left standing.”\nWhy has protein endured as the supposed holy grail of nutrients, with many of us wholeheartedly joining the quest to consume ever-greater quantities?\nThe history of manufacturing and marketing protein-enriched products goes back almost as far as the discovery of protein itself.\nGerman chemist\xa0Justus von Liebig, one of the earliest to identify and study macronutrients, came to regard protein “as the only true nutrient.” Liebig was also the first to mass-produce and distribute a product associated with protein in the 1860s, “Liebig’s Extract of Meat.”\nAuthor Gyorgy Scrinis\xa0writes that through\xa0“advertising and favourable publicity, the [Liebig’s Extract of Meat] company achieved ‘considerable success.’” Particularly for those who could not afford to purchase meat, the extract seemed a reasonable and satiating substitute.\nProtein consumption has remained a central component of nutritional advice and marketing campaigns ever since, even amid recycled and recurring arguments over the optimal amount of protein and whether plant or animal sources are best.\nAround the time Liebig launched his extract company, John Harvey Kellogg, a staunch vegetarian, set out to\xa0redefine traditional American meals\xa0at his health sanitarium in Battle Creek, Michigan.\nThe Kellogg family invented flaked breakfast cereals, granola, nut butters and various “nut meats,” which they produced, packaged, marketed and sold across the nation. Kellogg wrote countless tracts denouncing meat-heavy diets and assuring readers that high-protein plant foods could easily replace meat.\nIn an April 1910 issue of his periodical “Good Health,” Kellogg posited that “Beans, peas, lentils and nuts afford an ample proportion of the protein elements which are essential for blood making and tissue building.”\nAlongside the meat and cereal companies consistently touting the high protein content of their foods, the first processed protein shake appeared on the market in 1952 with bodybuilder mogul Bob Hoffman’s\xa0Hi-Proteen Shakes, made from a combination of soy protein, whey and flavorings.\nIn the 1970s through the 1990s, protein products remained visible but receded somewhat with the dietary spotlight firmly fixed on low-calorie, low-fat, sugar-free snack foods and beverages\xa0following the publication of studies\xa0linking sugar and saturated fat consumption to heart disease. \nThese decades gave us Slimfast and Diet Coke as well as fat-free (and guilt-free) SnackWell’s cookies and Lay’s potato chips.\nNew research in 2003, however,\xa0suggested high-protein diets could aid in weight loss, and protein quickly regained its former nutrient-superstar status.\nEntire diets followed, each offering an array of protein drinks and bars. Robert Atkins first published his low-carb, high-protein “Dr Atkins’ Diet Revolution” in 1982. It went on to become one of the 50 best-selling books of all time by the early 2000s, despite a\xa0New England Journal of Medicine article in 2003 clearly recommending:\xa0“Longer and larger studies [were] required to determine the long-term safety and efficacy of low-carbohydrate, high-protein, high-fat diets” such as Atkins’.\nThe long-term pursuit of protein in hopes of achieving bigger muscles, smaller waists and fewer hunger pangs shows no sign of abating, and there has never been a dearth of those willing to take advantage of the public’s dietary goals by handing out unnecessary advice or a new protein-packed product.\nIn the end, most people living in high-income nations are consuming enough protein. When we replace meals with a protein bar or shake, we also risk missing out on the rich sources of antioxidants, vitamins and many other benefits of real food.\nHannah Cutting-Jones is Lecturer, Department of History at the University of Oregon.

      Food prices expected to rise further in coming months amid higher energy costs: Gan Kim Yong
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Food prices\xa0are expected to “rise further in the coming months” as energy prices are set to increase, Minister for Trade and Industry Gan Kim Yong said on Wednesday (Nov 3).\nIn a written answer\xa0to a question\xa0by MP Shawn Huang Wei Zhong (PAP-Jurong GRC) about\xa0the impact on\xa0food prices given supply chain disruption and increase in energy costs, Mr Gan said that energy prices contribute to the global cost of food.\nHe added that suppliers may need to adjust prices to reflect the cost increases.\n“The cost of food is affected by a combination of factors, including the imported prices, energy costs, freight, labour, and seasonal weather changes,” he said.\nDomestic food prices have risen in the past six months, mainly due to “increased prices for global food commodities, higher energy prices, supply chain bottlenecks and labour shortages”, said the minister.\nFive electricity retailers have pulled out of the Singapore market over the past three weeks, citing volatile market conditions after a spike in wholesale energy prices.\nGlobal supply chains have been under pressure due to the COVID-19 pandemic,\xa0which has reduced manpower, delayed ships and caused bottlenecks at major ports worldwide.\nMr Gan said that the Government will assist families in Singapore in “various ways” to mitigate the impact of higher food prices.\n“For example, the Ministry of Social and Family Development\'s\xa0social service offices provide ComCare assistance to low-income households to support their daily living expenses,” he said.\n""The Budget 2020 Grocery Vouchers Scheme has also helped less well-off Singaporeans with their household expenses during this period of economic uncertainty.""\nLast month, about 160,000 eligible Singaporeans\xa0received\xa0S$100 worth of grocery vouchers.\n“Singapore will continue to diversify our import sources to keep prices competitive and enhance supply resilience,” Mr Gan said.\n', 'related_topics': ['     food ', '     energy ', '     Singapore Parliament ']}"

      Meet Singapore's only Japanese female chef helming a fine dining restaurant
  </h1>, 'text': 'Eleven years ago, finding a female chef behind a sushi counter in Tokyo was unprecedented, much less one who runs her own fine dining restaurant focusing on a specialisation like kappo cuisine.\nA little more than a decade later, chef Akane Eno is bucking that trend in Singapore, with Ichigo Ichie – the\xa0kappo restaurant she opened in February 2020, right at the start of the pandemic.\nTo date, chef Eno is the only female Japanese chef helming a Japanese fine dining restaurant here. Her\xa0intimate\xa016-seater –\xa0backed by founders of beef specialist The Gyu Bar and one-Michelin starred Sushi Kimura – is\xa0located at InterContinental Robertson Quay.\nFor the uninitiated, “kappo” is a multi-course meal that is left entirely up to the chef. The term means to cut and to cook, and it is a style that spotlights\xa0the chef’s preparation of the meal in front of guests who get to savour the entire dining experience with all five senses.\nWhat may be a little bit surprising is that the 43-year-old never even thought about becoming a chef – but an\xa0art curator. It\xa0was art history she decided to\xa0pursue\xa0at university, right after high school.\nThat said, the soft-spoken and self-professed avid foodie told CNA Lifestyle that she always considered cooking as an art. Growing up in Tokyo, she dined out frequently and was always curious about how ingredients were sculpted into her favourite dishes.\n\xa0\nDuring her formative years, meals at steakhouses and French restaurants were family favourites for special occasions. “My mother cooked Japanese food at home, so my parents and I enjoyed exploring flavours from other cultures,” she reminisced.\nIt was only after earning her degree at the age of 21 that Eno decided to enroll at the Tsuji Culinary Institute in Osaka, armed with the resolve that it was time to\xa0pursue a different art form.\nAnd yes, even though\xa0the F&B industry is thought of as a male-dominated one, especially in Japan, Eno shared with CNA Lifestyle that she never felt she was treated differently, be it\xa0at culinary school or in the professional kitchen. \nAccording to her, the majority of her classmates\xa0were female and felt that overall, there\xa0was no gender bias. That said, very few ended up becoming chefs while others\xa0ended up taking\xa0front-of-house roles.\nThis however, Eno\xa0feels has nothing to do with gender but everything to do with ethos and age.\n""Cooking can be physically and mentally tiring, so you need to have the right mindset,” she explained. ""“Many people want to play and enjoy their young adulthood.""\nShe would know. After all, she was four years\xa0older than her classmates at culinary school. She also concedes\xa0to being pretty\xa0""serious"" when it comes to her studies.\xa0\nIt is definitely a tough industry, admitted\xa0Eno,\xa0noting that the three or four fellow female chef trainees she worked alongside early in her career have all\xa0left the F&B industry.\nAt another fine dining kappo restaurant in Tokyo, she had two female co-workers who both quit within a couple of years. And again, it\'s not so much an issue of gender, she reckoned, but the lack of personal time that compels\xa0people to leave the industry.\xa0\n“For example, the youngest staff had to report at 9am and service usually ended at 2am. It was a good environment to learn but it was not easy. And these hours are quite normal,” Eno said. \n""But it is what it is,"" she emphasised. ""In my personal opinion, if you want to learn something, sometimes long hours are necessary. If you see it as just a job, it’s difficult to continue. You need the passion and dedication to learn.”\nAll this is\xa0not to say that gender differences aren\'t apparent in some aspects.\xa0“Most men can carry big and heavy stock pots, while for women, it is likely to be more difficult. We just have to split the load into two parts and do the task as efficiently as we can,” Eno shared frankly.\nAnd yes, there is always the odd comment to contend with, particularly from new customers who will come to the restaurant and ask where is the head chef, even when Eno herself is serving them.\n“One female customer\xa0asked me when will the male head chef come out to prepare the food,” she shared with a wry smile. “ And I laughed and politely told her that that was me!”\nWhile she does acknowledge\xa0that indeed few women chefs make it to the top in Japanese restaurants, Eno chooses not to let anything\xa0faze her. Instead, the\xa0indefatigable chef\xa0prefers\xa0to focus on the food and the experience.\nAfter all, with now\xa0more than 20 years of experience under her belt, chef Eno has found a stage with Ichigo Ichie to showcase her culinary talents using the freshest ingredients of each season, exquisitely\xa0presented on the plate as she strives to push her creativity and delight\xa0the palate of each guest.\nHer mentor chef Masaru Furusawa, she shared, is someone who has played a key role in her culinary journey.\xa0It was Furusawa who recommended Eno for a job opportunity in Singapore back in 2015. \nAccording to Eno, chef Furusawa was\xa0always welcoming\xa0young, inexperienced chefs on his team to work with him at the counter where guests were seated – front and centre for all to see. It was a custom rather unusual for the industry and very progressive\xa0compared to his peers.\nIt’s this very practice – one that is regardless of gender and experience – that Eno is determined to continue at Ichigo Ichie.\n“I don’t hire young female chefs to work under me because they are female chefs. I hire them because of their willingness to learn and their abilities,” she said. “If any young chef has the attitude, work ethics and willingness that fit my working style, I will hire them – male or female.”\nTwo years after arriving in Singapore, she met chef Tomoo Kimura and joined him at his eponymous restaurant Sushi Kimura as head chef, forming part of the team that garnered a Michelin star. \nIt was there that the concept of Ichigo Ichie first emerged in 2019, and her restaurant began its roots as a weekly pop-up right at Sushi Kimura itself in Palais Renaissance.\xa0Its evolution into a full-fledged kappo restaurant came the following year in 2020.\nNamed after a famous 16th century tea ceremony saying that means “one life, one moment”, the restaurant is inspired by the Japanese philosophies of ichigo ichie and sanpo\xa0yoshi – the latter being a 17th century concept that means “three way satisfaction” – the belief that business should benefit all parties involved.\nSupporting industry partners has always been important to Eno; earlier this year, she designed special menus that highlighted Iga wagyu and sake from Kitajima Brewery.\nFurther inspired by this philosophy, Eno has spearheaded a new initiative to establish a cycle of giving and gaining with her suppliers and guests. The inaugural project featured Azumano Fumoto Sake Brewery in Yamagata.\nA portion of the proceeds from the sanpo yoshi menu was used to purchase rice from farmers. The sake brewery will use this rice to craft a private label bottle of sake exclusive to Ichigo Ichie, slated to be ready in the first half of 2022. Eno has also been discussing ideas for the bottle label with students from the Tohoku University of Art & Design.\n\xa0\nSo how do her Singapore guests benefit? Those who had made bookings for the sanpo yoshi menu will receive a complimentary full-sized bottle of the exclusive sake when they return for dinner once the sake is shipped to Singapore. Every guest will also enjoy a complimentary welcome glass of the sake while bottles are still available.\nFor Eno, starting a restaurant during a pandemic wasn’t easy. And it was quite a feat to pivot to takeaways during Singapore’s circuit breaker.\n“It was the first time in my entire career that I had to do takeaways, and I had only just opened my first restaurant,” she shared. “Of course I was worried and stressed! But you know, there was no choice but to look ahead\xa0– everyone was in the same boat and we simply had to focus on creating a takeaway menu.\n“Since everyone was stuck at home, I thought we should offer comforting flavours with dishes like Japanese donabe rice. It’s one of my favourites.”\n“One of my biggest worries was that I couldn\'t see or hear the expressions of my customers when they have our takeaway food. I would always wonder what they think about the flavour, the texture? Do they like my cooking? Not being able to interact with customers was something I really missed during that period.”\nIndeed, interacting with customers is one of the most important aspects of the job that chef Eno enjoys. And she advises the next generation of young chefs wanting to join this tough industry, male or female, to relish in that.\n“Believe in yourself and keep pushing on,” she said. “There is nothing meaningless about what happens in your life.""\nIchigo Ichie is open for lunch and dinner Mondays to Saturdays at 1\xa0Nanson Rd, #02-07A, Intercontinental Robertson Quay. The restaurant is closed on the first Monday of each month.\n', 'related_topics': ['     food ', '     Restaurants ', '     Japan ', ""     Women's Voices "", '     Chefs ']}"

      Cutting out even a little salt can have big health benefits, studies show
  </h1>, 'text': 'Sometimes, seemingly small changes in a health measurement can make a very large difference to people’s wellbeing. Such is the case with the effect on blood pressure of the essential nutrient sodium, the problematic half of the popular flavoring agent sodium chloride, commonly known as salt.\nThe amount of salt that is safe for people to consume has been embroiled in controversy for a century, and the debate is unlikely to be resolved anytime soon. Scores of studies of varying quality linking sodium intake and health have swung the pendulum back and forth, stymieing regulations to limit sodium in most commercially prepared foods. Some people are especially sensitive to sodium’s ability to raise blood pressure, but given how common high blood pressure already is, and how difficult it is to avoid consuming too much salt, many experts maintain that the safest approach is an overall reduction in sodium levels in prepared and processed foods.\nMore than 100 million Americans have high blood pressure, a disorder that increases their risk of heart attacks and strokes, and which, for many people, is made worse by consuming too much sodium. Just a four-millimeter rise in blood pressure –\xa0say, from 130mm to 134mm of mercury –\xa0can jeopardise the health of some people, and the blood pressure of those who are especially salt-sensitive can rise by 10 or more millimeters of mercury on a typical high-salt diet.\nIn\xa02010, a Stanford University team estimated\xa0that cutting about 350mg\xa0of sodium a day (less than a sixth of a teaspoon) would lower systolic blood pressure by only 1.25mm\xa0of mercury yet avert about a million strokes and heart attacks.\nA\xa0new study conducted in 600 villages in rural China\xa0of 20,995 people known to face a high risk of stroke, demonstrated that substituting reduced-sodium salt for regular table salt significantly decreased the rate of cardiovascular events and associated deaths during an average follow-up of less than five years.\nThe protection occurred in households that used modified table salt in which potassium chloride replaced 30 per cent of sodium chloride, even though there was no change in their use of other rich sources of sodium like soy sauce and MSG. Fifteen years earlier, a\xa0similar study among elderly veterans in Taiwan\xa0who used a potassium-enriched salt reduced cardiovascular mortality by 41 per cent in less than three years.\nTIPS FOR CUTTING DOWN ON SODIUM\nCompanies have found that gradually lowering the sodium content of their products and making no fanfare about it, like not claiming they’re “low sodium"",\xa0actually fosters consumer acceptance. Most people don’t even notice the change. But you may not have to wait for companies to do the work. For example, you can reduce the salt in many canned foods, like beans, by rinsing them in a colander. Or try my trick of diluting the salt in canned soups by first filling the bowl or pot with fresh spinach and other quick-cooking or precooked veggies before adding the soup and heating it in the microwave or saucepan.\nIf you hope to enhance your health by cutting down on sodium, one trick is to avoid going cold turkey. I and many others have found that it’s relatively easy to reduce one’s preference for high salt by gradually using and consuming less of it. As your taste buds adjust, high-salt foods you once enjoyed will probably taste unpleasantly salty and thus easy to resist.\nIn cooking, rather than adding salt when preparing a recipe, try salting the finished product, which is likely to please your palate with considerably less salt. Seasoning foods with citrus juices, hot-pepper flakes or other pungent herbs and spices can go a long way to make up for reduced salt. You might also eat less bread; as a category, bread and other bakery products contribute more to Americans’ sodium intake than any other foodstuffs.\nBut an even greater contribution most likely comes from restaurant-prepared foods, which Dr\xa0Jacobson calls a salt-laden minefield. I’ve noticed that the day after I dine in a restaurant, I weigh about two pounds more, not because I ate two extra pounds of food but because the excess salt in what I did eat retains that much water in my body.\nIn lieu of government regulations to limit sodium, consumers might consider writing to producers of their favorite commercial products and asking that they consider lowering the amount of salt used.\nCurrently, the amount of sodium in the typical American diet is more than one-third higher than the daily limit of 2,300mg\xa0recommended by the American Heart Association for otherwise healthy people, and it is more than double the amount –\xa01,500mg\xa0–\xa0the association considers ideal for people with elevated blood pressure. The actual physiological requirement for sodium is a mere 220mg\xa0a day, so these recommended amounts provide a huge safety margin.\nThe human species evolved on a very low-sodium diet of 200mg to 600mg\xa0a day. In fact, our bodies are designed to conserve sodium and get rid of potassium, which explains why a high-sodium diet can be a problem. The body holds on to excess sodium, increasing the chances of ill effects.\nBefore refrigeration, salt was prized for its ability to preserve foods, and was so highly valued it was used for currency. Now, however, salt has become the bête noir of physicians who treat heart disease, hypertension and kidney disease, among other deadly disorders. Though doctors have long argued that Americans should consume less salt, the wheels of regulatory action turn at a glacial pace, and modifying people’s taste buds is equally challenging.\nHOW THE FOOD INDUSTRY IS TACKLING SALT\nAs far back as 1979, an advisory group commissioned by the Food and Drug Administration recommended that salt’s status as\xa0“generally recognised as safe” should be reconsidered.\xa0But the agency only asked the food industry to voluntarily reduce the amount of salt used in commercial foods. Now, at least, the amount of sodium in packaged foods has been added to nutrition labels, giving consumers a leg up if they take the time to compare brands before heading to the checkout counter.\nThe ongoing problem with salt is thoroughly discussed in an excellent book published last year, Salt Wars, The Battle Over the Biggest Killer in the American Diet,\xa0by Michael F\xa0Jacobson, the former executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer advocacy group based in Washington, DC.\nWithout waiting for a regulatory hammer, Dr\xa0Jacobson told me, “some companies have made a real effort to lower the amount of sodium in their products. There are lots of tricks companies can use.”\nFor example, in its canned tomato soup, Campbell’s replaced a quarter of regular salt with potassium chloride, lowering sodium from 760mg to 480mg\xa0per cup, with no adverse effect on consumer acceptance. Nabisco cut the sodium in Wheat Thins, my favorite snack cracker, from 370mg to 180mg\xa0an ounce, and General Mills reduced the sodium in Wheaties, the cereal my sons grew up on, from 370mg to 185mg\xa0an ounce. For those fond of crunchy chips, check out the Kale & Spinach Tortilla Chips from the CVS store brand Abound, which have only 75mg\xa0of sodium an ounce (about 11 chips).\nBy Jane E Brody © The New York Times\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Diet ', '     food ', '     health ', '     Nutrition ']}"

      Cloud kitchens gain traction in Indonesia as pandemic drives demand 
  </h1>, 'text': 'JAKARTA: The COVID-19 pandemic was raging when Nurul Fauzia decided to open her own food business in December last year selling pastries and puddings. She needed to supplement her income after her pilot husband had his salary reduced.\nOperating from her home in Jakarta’s neighbouring city Tangerang, Zia’s Pastries proved to be a hit with customers, with dozens of online orders coming her way every day.\xa0\nBut despite her efforts to promote her business on social media, there was little room to grow.\nThe main problem was that her house – located on a small road 20km from the heart of Jakarta – was out of reach for many people. “(Potential customers) even said to me that the delivery fee would cost more than the food. I got that a lot. I had to expand,” Mdm Fauzia told CNA.\nBut renting space within the city of Jakarta is pricey, as another food entrepreneur Edwin Hartanto found out.\n“To open your own store, you need to spend 200 million rupiah (US$14,000) a year in rent and property owners usually want three years (worth of rent) to be paid upfront. The initial investment is big. Not to mention the fact that you need to spend money on modifying the space to fit your needs and hiring waiters, janitors and security,” the Cwims co-owner told CNA.\nCwims, which sells soup noodles, runs six physical shops at the fringes of the city. It was looking to establish a presence in a more strategic location.\xa0\nBoth entrepreneurs said eventually they found a solution to their problem: renting a space at a cloud kitchen. The market for these spaces has been on the rise in Indonesia since the pandemic began.\nCloud kitchens operate by renting spaces to multiple food businesses which offer meals made for delivery and takeaways. This greatly reduces the amount of space required, allowing brands to operate in an area as tiny as 6 sqm.\nBut the main advantage of joining a cloud kitchen is that it allows food brands to have a presence in a desirable location for a small rental fee, which can be as low as a few hundred dollars a month.\nAlthough they have been around in other countries for years, cloud kitchens – also known as ghost kitchens, shared kitchens and other names – are still in their infancy in Indonesia.\nMr Satrio Wiavianto, operations manager at cloud kitchen provider Everplate, said it was a struggle to get food brands on board when they first opened in February 2020.\n“In the beginning, not many people were familiar with the concept of cloud kitchen. They didn’t know what the value proposition offered by cloud kitchen was,” he told CNA, adding that they only managed to attract 10 tenants at their first location in an upscale residential area in Jakarta.\xa0\nThe facility was designed to host 36.\xa0\nA month later, the pandemic hit Indonesia and the subsequent lockdown forced many restaurants to stop serving dining-in customers or close their brick-and-mortar outlets entirely. \n“The pandemic forced these players to pivot their strategy to online operations,” Mr Wiavianto said. Since then, Everplate has opened six more locations and worked with more than 200 food businesses.\nOne of Indonesia’s biggest cloud kitchens, Yummykitchen, was in a similar situation when they opened in May 2019. “Before the pandemic, it was hard to convince people to join us. Everyone believed that they should build their own restaurants,” its communications manager Diandra Kusuma Wardhani told CNA.\nAt the beginning of 2020, Yummykitchen only had eight locations. Today, the company has 52 kitchens in six Indonesian cities, with plans to add 50 more in the next six months.\nAccording to a report by consultancy firm RedSeer, cloud kitchens are expected to contribute a 15 per cent share to the overall Indonesian online food delivery sector by the end of 2021, up from 5 per cent in 2019.\nOnline food delivery in Southeast Asia, meanwhile, grew by 183 per cent in 2020 compared to the year before, according to a report by venture capital firm Momentum works.\nThe same report stated that Indonesia had the largest food delivery service market in Southeast Asia in 2020, with a gross merchandise value of US$3.7 billion, about 31 per cent of the total food delivery value in the region.\nMeanwhile, more and more people were venturing into the food business to supplement their income after the pandemic battered the country’s economy. According to Google, the number of queries for “food business ideas” in Indonesia rose 250 per cent throughout 2020.\nHowever, cloud kitchens did not only attract budding food entrepreneurs but also well-established businesses seeking to expand to other locations as well as brands from overseas looking to dip their toes in the Indonesian market.\n“They do this by working with a cloud kitchen first. This is their strategy before they open their own physical restaurant,” said Mr Nicholas Hum, the chief executive officer of cloud kitchen operator Telepot.\nPart of the appeal of cloud kitchens is that they are normally located in areas with high demand for online food deliveries, something which might not be available to new food brands operating out of the owners’ homes.\nAnother benefit is that the spaces provided are normally move-in ready. The kitchens have been fitted to adhere to food safety regulations and they come equipped with exhaust, running water, electricity and a centralised gas system.\n“All (tenants) have to do is to bring in their equipment and they can start operating within a week, whereas if you open in a mall, it can take one to two months at the minimum to develop the space,” Mr Rohan Kalwani, the chief executive officer of Eden Kitchens, told CNA.\n“We also provide numerous services for them. We help them with the onboarding process to online food delivery platforms, we do the cleaning, we do pest control. And a significant portion of the marketing that they have to do is taken care of by Eden Kitchens.”\nTelepot, which only began operating in May, went even further by providing tenants with access to a co-working space and a photo studio where they can take professional pictures of their food.\nThe company also provides business and intellectual property rights consultation, particularly for newcomers in the food and beverage industry.\n“You can have zero knowledge on the industry but if you know how to cook, if you’re willing to invest here, the rest we will guide you,” Mr Hum, the Telepot CEO, said.\nMeanwhile, Yummykitchen is operating on a different business model. Food brands only need to supply precooked or ready-to-serve food while the company provides everything from equipment to manpower.\nThe cloud kitchen will take orders, heat up the meals, pack them and hand them over to delivery riders and customers. In return, it takes a cut of the profit.\n“All of their needs are taken care of by us, so our partners can make their (business) expansion quickly and easily. Yummykitchen will take care of the day-to-day operations … so they can focus on their business development strategy,” Yummykitchen marketing director Raetedy Refanatha told CNA.\nJoining a cloud kitchen located in an upscale residential area in Jakarta has\xa0proven to be a good decision for Mr Hartanto’s Cwims.\xa0\n“Initially, we only rented a 7 sqm space because we thought there would only be less than 50 orders a day. Eventually, we moved to a 10 sqm space (within the same facility) and the space we have now is no longer adequate,” he said.\n“Today, we are handling more than 150 orders a day. We have no room to add more staff. We need more storage space. When ingredients come, we have nowhere to put them. We are in the process of moving to a 19 sqm space.”\nMr Hartato said Cwims is also looking to expand to three more cloud kitchens.\nMr Kalwani of Eden Kitchens said had it not been for the pandemic, it would have taken the industry years to get to where it is today.\xa0\n“I still think we are at the early stage as an industry. It’s definitely very interesting to see how this goes two, three years from now,” he said.\nAsked if the cloud kitchen industry is here to stay once the pandemic is over, Mr Kalwani said: “This is the question we asked ourselves many times.”\nThe CEO admitted that dining out with friends and families, particularly at “Instagrammable” restaurants with sleek decor and captivating views of the city or the outdoors, is a big part of Indonesian culture.\xa0\xa0\xa0\n“Cloud kitchens are not here to compete with this directly. Both of these choices will remain. They are definitely something which will coexist simultaneously,” he said.\nMr Wiavianto of Everplate pointed to the fact that in other countries, cloud kitchens have existed and thrived before the pandemic.\n“The main reason why cloud kitchens exist has more to do with the increasing demand for online food delivery. In the past five years, online food delivery has grown significantly. This creates another need for the food industry to prepare food more effectively and efficiently,” he said.\nMeanwhile, Yummykitchen is already looking at a hybrid model by providing dining areas in select locations. “We are starting to collaborate with a number of building management to operate the buildings’ food courts,” Mr Refanatha said.\n“Right now, we are still focusing on online sales but in the long run when the pandemic is over … this will further benefit our tenants and partners.”\nThe presence of cloud kitchens has allowed Mdm Fauzia’s pastry business to expand to two of Jakarta’s upscale neighbourhoods. But Mdm Fauzia said she intended to use cloud kitchens as a stepping stone for her business and she still hoped of one day opening her own brick-and-mortar bakery.\n“If I gain enough capital or find a business partner, I want to open my own store. I can offer more than just pastries and start selling custom-made cakes or other food,” she said. “I think that’s the dream of every food entrepreneur.”\nMr Hartanto of Cwims, however, disagreed that having a physical outlet is a measure of a food business’s success.\n“Time has changed. In the past, you were judged by how big your restaurant is and how many restaurants you operate,” he said.\n“But now, it is about being present online, no matter where our customers may be. There is a sense of accomplishment when customers open their app and see that you are everywhere.”\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\n', 'related_topics': ['     Indonesia ', '     food ', '     business ', '     COVID-19 ']}"

      Impossible Foods to roll out meatless pork in Singapore, Hong Kong, US
  </h1>, 'text': ""HONG KONG: Impossible Foods is rolling out its meatless pork product in Hong Kong in October and Singapore later in the year as it tries to bolster its footprint in the fast-growing plant-based food space.\nThe California-based company said the ground minced pork substitute would be available in 120 restaurants in Hong Kong from Oct 4.\nThe product will also be sold in some Hong Kong grocery stores as ready-to-eat meals. The company is also debuting the product in New York's Manhattan restaurant Momofuku Ssam Bar from Sep\xa023.\nReuters reported in April that Impossible, which makes faux beef products, is preparing for a public listing which could value the US company at around US$10 billion or more. Impossible is exploring going public through an initial public offering (IPO) in the next 12 months or a merger with a so-called special acquisition company (SPAC).\n“It’s a natural step in evolution and growth of our business but the timing is really (to be decided) and we will see how it goes over the course of the next year,” Dennis Woodside, president of Impossible Foods, told Reuters in an interview.\nImpossible’s pork product, which is made from the same key ingredient as its beef product – soy – enters the Hong Kong market at a time when homegrown brands, including Green Monday’s Omnipork have already made inroads into the pork substitutes market in Asia’s financial hub.\nImpossible’s product will be priced higher than animal pork to start with but the company said it aims to continually drive down prices as it has done for its Impossible Beef products.\n“We are optimising our manufacturing process, really every month, and continually growing our manufacturing footprint and as we fill up our factories that is when we can lower unit cost,” Woodside said.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     food ']}"

      Commentary: Could edible insects and bugs be a key part of F&amp;B menus in Singapore soon? 
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: After chickening out from a dare by my father to try a fried cockroach during a family trip in Cambodia, I finally mustered up the courage to sample brownies made with cricket flour during a corporate event in London. \nIt was also the first time I heard insect farming can be more sustainable than traditional animal agriculture in terms of land, water and energy use. \nSince then, I’ve committed to minimising my meat and seafood consumption, mainly to reduce my carbon footprint. But I’ve felt conflicted about eating plant-based foods that are equally resource-intensive to produce such as avocado, almond or cashew. \nAs a regular runner, I have also struggled with getting sufficient protein intake from soy-based meat substitutes such as tempeh or tofu. \nMost people associate alternative protein with cell- or plant-based meat substitutes such as Impossible Foods or Beyond Meat, overlooking the health and environmental benefits of eating insects. \nOver 2,100 species of insects are consumed in 140 different countries across the Asia-Pacific, the Americas and Africa, according to a recent report by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Some of the most popular edible insects include beetles, caterpillars, ants, bees, wasps, grasshoppers, locusts and crickets. \nInsects are a high-fibre, high-protein food source which are low in salt and\xa0rich in vitamins, minerals and fatty acids, although their nutritional value varies depending on the species.\nCrickets for instance are complete proteins, meaning they contain all nine essential amino acids which is not always the case with plant-based meat alternatives. 100g of crickets contains approximately 60g to 70g of protein – two to three times more compared to the equivalent amount of beef or chicken. \nInsects require less feed, grow and reproduce quickly, are more efficient in turning their food into protein, produce less waste and emit fewer greenhouse gases compared to conventional livestock. \nIn land-scarce places such as Singapore, insect cultivation could help improve food security and advance the city-state’s 30 by 30 goal – increasing the proportion of locally produced food from 10 to 30 per cent by 2030.\xa0 \nEven though more than 2 billion people globally consume insects based on the latest FAO data, the idea of bugs as food or feed is still met with disgust and reluctance around the world. \nFor example, feeding farmed seafood insects, rather than fish, could help reverse overfishing and create more sustainable and cost-effective aquacultural practices. \nYet a survey conducted in January 2021 by Professor Shirley Ho at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) revealed mixed opinions on the use of insects as fish feed. \n92 per cent of Singaporeans and permanent residents interviewed were open to using okara meal, a by-product from tofu and soy milk production, while only 46 per cent would endorse plastic-eating mealworm larvae as aquafeed, likely because of food safety concerns.\nUnlike other Southeast Asian countries such as Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam or Thailand, insects have never been part of Singaporean cuisine, but providing transparency over how insects are raised and what they are being fed could help dispel worries over food safety.\xa0 \nSingapore’s two edible insect start-ups Asia Insect Farms Solution (AIFS) and Altimate Nutrition currently partner with farms in Southeast Asia where insects are reared in a controlled, hygienic environment and live on a vegetable-based diet without any hormones, antibiotics or other chemicals. \nBoth companies aim to eventually set up their own production facility in Singapore. \nIn addition, upcycling food waste, agricultural by-products or manure from livestock agriculture offers a low-cost, high-nutrition feed for insects whilst creating a circular farming operation. \nBut rigorous and regular testing is required to mitigate potential food safety risks. \n“General food waste tends to be more heterogenous in composition. It may contain toxic substances and be prone to microbial contamination, which could pass on to the animals and eventually consumers if we use general waste to feed insects”, warns Professor William Chen,\xa0Director of NTU’s Food Science and Technology Programme. \nOne solution is to feed insects more homogenous and cleaner pre-consumer food waste such as okara or spent grains, a by-product of the brewing industry, adds Chen. \xa0\nThe import or sale of insects for human consumption is not currently authorised by the Singapore Food Agency (SFA), although AIFS and Altimate Nutrition expect to receive regulatory approval to commercialise their products in the fourth quarter of 2021. \nTo overcome the “ick factor” typically associated with insects, instead of whole insects, the two companies use cricket flour in functional foods that consumers are already familiar with. Crickets are often considered “edible insects for beginners” because of their earthy, nutty flavour with little after-taste. \xa0\n“During our sensory evaluation, not one participant complained about the taste being different because the protein bar was made with insect flour and most were open to buying it as a snack”, says Gavriel Tan, co-founder of Altimate Nutrition. \nTan plans to charge S$5 at launch and eventually reach a price point which is 10 to 20 per cent cheaper compared to an average protein bar. \nForward-looking restaurateurs are also embracing insects as an ingredient for more innovative menus. With the aim of promoting more sustainable sources of protein whilst preserving local food heritage, social entrepreneur Aaron Yeoh partnered with AIFS to trial cricket flour in some of the dishes for his soon-to-be-launched cafe.\nHis team replaced plain flour with 20 per cent cricket flour in their blondie recipe, which has allowed the cake to maintain its moisture while increasing its protein content.\nThey have also experimented with blending black soldier flies (BSF), primarily used as animal feed, into chili paste. \nAlthough it was never marketed commercially, Insectta, Singapore’s first BSF farm and biotech company, had also tried making edible insect dishes including slider patties, pasta, cookies and sambal, and was even approached by brewery Red Dot to collaborate on an insect-infused beer.\nBSF has a faint taste of pork lard and smells like roasted peanuts, and is easy to eat when seasoned with familiar spices such as salted egg yolk, mala or pink salt, shares Insectta co-founder Kai-Ning Chua. \nPerhaps the key to unlocking this entirely new area of food lies in the younger generation and customised workshops for children are already part of the plan in Chua’s case. \n“The younger generation will be the fastest adopters of edible insects”, says Yuvanesh Tamil Selvan, co-founder of AIFS who found children to be the most receptive to trying insects during his outreach work with schools. \nAlternative protein including insects could offer a viable solution to counter unsustainable agricultural practices, as well as excessive consumption and food waste in certain countries and continued hunger in others. \nBut as a novel food that wasn’t traditionally part of Singapore’s culinary history, it might take an entire generation to make the cultural shift of adopting insects as part of their everyday diet.\nTrang Chu Minh is a consultant on international development projects.\xa0This commentary was written in the author’s personal capacity.

      Creative Capital: Simbian Chua’s bakkwa 'croffles' are making this heritage treat cool again
  </h1>, 'text': 'Like most Singaporeans, I follow a fair number of foodies on Instagram.\nEarlier in the year, I began to notice that several of the ones that I trust — i.e. the ones who pay for their own food — were all ordering a gorgeous and authentic-looking Indonesian bakmie from a brand I had never heard of, Indocin Food.\nBased on those social media posts, I had to try it. And it was amazing. I ordered it not once, not twice, but again and again (hence my expanding waistline). I also tried the other Indonesian-Chinese dishes made by this small artisan brand, which I discovered only started during and because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The nasi lemak, the nasi padang\xa0and the Balinese roast pork were all outstanding.\nBecause of my gluttony, I also got to know Indocin Food’s founder, 30-year-old Chef Simbian Chua. I started to follow her Instagram feed and enjoyed her sense of humour and her authenticity. I also tried some of her outstanding Iberico pork bakkwa, sold under another relatively new brand, Century Bakkwa. Century Bakkwa has just opened its first flagship store on Dunlop Street. Given the occasion, I thought I would chat with Chua about her life and her businesses.\nTELL ME ABOUT YOUR UPBRINGING. YOU HAVE OPENLY TALKED ABOUT COMING FROM HUMBLE BEGINNINGS ON INSTAGRAM. WHAT WAS LIFE LIKE GROWING UP?\nI grew up in a staunch 7th Adventist family. My parents have never eaten pork in their life — I don’t anticipate them ever patronising Century Bakkwa. I like to say that my parents provided me what I needed, but never what I wanted. If I needed S$1, they would give S$0.30 and make we work for the S$0.70. Looking back, I am very grateful for this upbringing because it turned me into a hardworking person, which opened me up to a lot of opportunities.\nHOW AND WHEN DID YOU DISCOVER AND INTEREST IN FOOD AND COOKING?\nWell, this is the irony of my life. As both my parents are 7th day Adventist, we did not get to eat out often, as most (commercial) food contains seafood, lard and pork. This made my Peranakan mother a full-time cook at home and this made me her Sous Chef. It was through that experience that I realised that the way to anybody’s heart is possibly through the stomach.\nYOU STARTED WORKING PRETTY YOUNG. WHAT WAS YOUR FIRST JOB?\nI started working at Burger King Parkway Parade at 13. Back then, they paid me S$3.30 per hour, but the free flow Coca Cola was what attracted me to stay for a year.\nON INSTAGRAM, YOU’VE SAID THAT F&B IS A GREAT INDUSTRY FOR PEOPLE WHO MAY NOT HAVE EXCELLED IN SCHOOL. CAN YOU ELABORATE?\nFrom my personal experience, F&B employers favour skills and commitment over academic achievements. We don’t need a degree to do mise en place.\nCENTURY BAKKWA’S PACKAGING SAYS IT WAS FOUNDED IN 1988. I ASSUME YOU WERE NOT EVEN BORN THEN. IS THIS A FAMILY BUSINESS?\nThe Century Bakkwa master recipe was created 33 years ago. It was founded by a bakkwa maestro, who had\xa0been selling charcoal grilled handmade bakkwa since 1988. A friend introduced us and we hit it off right away.\nOne day, the bakkwa maestro called me for support during the Chinese New Year rush as he couldn’t cope with the volume for Chinese New Year. So I went down with my team to assist them. What I thought to be a two-hour job turned into a two-week commitment. We were exhausted, overworked and overheated, but we were satisfied with doing a good job for him.\nAfter Chinese New Year, the bakkwa maestro and his wife came to speak to me. They told me that they would like to retire as he was turning 65. In his own words, he said that he would rather bury the recipe with him to his grave, like the Apollo char kway teow recipe, if he did not find a suitable successor to perpetuate his craft.\nHe entrusted me with his recipe and craft and I am honoured to continue this tradition and carry on the heritage. This is how Century Bakkwa was born and how we are producing his original bakkwa, along with other variations and food items.\nA crowd favourite has become our signature bakkwa croffle (croissant-waffle), our first permanent menu item that encapsulates both modernity and tradition. We wanted to bring something fresh to show how bakkwa isn’t just “Chinese New Year food” but a treat that can be enjoyed in different ways, all year round.\nYOU’VE JUST OPENED A PHYSICAL STORE FOR CENTURY BAKKWA. DO YOU THINK IT’S IMPORTANT TO HAVE A PHYSICAL PRESENCE AS OPPOSED TO BEING A PURELY E-COMMERCE OPERATION?\nAs Century Bakkwa is founded in Singapore, I have dreams to make it a heritage brand in time to come. I opened a physical store because I want a flagship store located in town, where I can meet customers face to face, speak to them and continuously improve Century Bakkwa.\nHOW AND WHEN DID YOU START INDOCIN AND MIE BIAN BIAN?\nIndocin Food was born from my own food cravings. COVID-19 had just happened and I couldn’t fly to Indonesia, where I worked for half a decade, running a restaurant and entertainment club. Stuck here, I started cooking and posting about Indonesian food. My Indonesian friends based in Singapore were home sick and commented that they could never taste it through the screen, so I invited them to come down and have a meal. They unanimously said that I should start selling Indonesian food and I thought, why not?\nInitially, I only wanted to try selling 10 boxes of artisan nasi padang. You know, to test the market? If no one liked my food, I figured I would pivot to something else. But life had other plans and I sold 50 boxes within 30 minutes. I immediately rushed down to Takashimaya to buy a large rice cooker. The sales lady there asked if I had a big family. I told her “I may have a small family, but I have big dreams"".\xa0From there, the rest is history. Today, we are a team of more than 10 at Indocin food and Century Bakkwa.\nYOUR F&B BRANDS (NOT COUNTING HEXAGON) SEEM TO CELEBRATE HERITAGE. HOW IMPORTANT IS HERITAGE TO YOU?\nHeritage is important to me. It helped me develop an awareness of who I am and where I come from. I do think it’s very important to promote quality food from our region, and I am excited to see that there is demand for it, that people are not only interested in global brands selling international food.\nHOW MUCH R&D GOES INTO THE PRODUCTS YOU SELL?\nThe longest R&D we did was for Miebianbian bakmie noodles. It took four\xa0months. Our Miebianbian bakmie noodle\xa0recipe originated from Medan. After we did R&D for the first month, I almost gave up. It was very tedious. We ate and threw away a lot of bakmie noodles. I never ate so many noodles all my life. There is also no bakmie noodles supplier in Singapore. Most are made in-house or they use mee\xa0kia as a replacement instead. I made my foodie friends come by for many rounds of food tasting. I soon realised that when I wouldn’t hear back from them, I failed. \xa0They just couldn’t bear to tell me. We revised the recipe at least eight times until one day, my foodie friends couldn’t stop calling me to ask me to release the bakmie noodles so they could order them. Only then, I knew we had succeeded. The R&D ended there. During the process, we broke a 30-litre\xa0commercial dough mixer within four\xa0months and I gained a few kilos. The weight is still on me right now.\nDO YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF A SERIAL ENTREPRENEUR? WHY RUN SO MANY DIFFERENT BUSINESSES CONCURRENTLY?\nActually no... I am just a cook. I just like to cook. I like experimenting with food. I work six days a week in the kitchen. On my off day, I will cook at home. I don’t know what I will do if I don’t cook.\nAND YET YOU ARE ALSO A BUSINESSWOMAN.\nI prefer the culinary side. I love the R&D. I love menu creation and making clients happy with the food. I think if you are in F&B for the business side, then you will be disappointed because F&B is time, cost, and labour-intensive. Without passion, one simply cannot be in this business. This business can be both rewarding and depressing, especially with all the constraints the industry is facing.\nYOU SEEM TO HAVE LED A COLOURFUL LIFE WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER. WHAT LESSONS HAVE YOU LEARNT FROM THOSE DAYS?\nI learnt to never be haolian (arrogant) no matter where you are in life, because nothing in life is permanent. Within a short span of time, I have seen a lot of haolian people rise and fall. Very xiasuay (embarrassing). Just be yourself. The biggest prize is that you will be able to build relationships and relate to many more nice and interesting people!\nWHAT IS THE HARDEST PART OF RUNNING YOUR OWN BUSINESS?\nThe hardest part is to find the right team members. I think that without the right team members, who have the same goal and direction as you, it’s very hard to go anywhere — especially in Singapore, where the wages in many other sector seem to be much higher than F&B. It’s hard keeping people and growing a team. But I so happy with the current team we managed to build.\nWHAT IS THE BIGGEST MISCONCEPTION ABOUT YOU?\nDespite being so outspoken on social media, people who have met me in person are often surprised by how quiet I am.\nYOU SEEM TO HAVE REALLY LONG DAYS. CAN YOU WALK ME THROUGH AN AVERAGE DAY IN YOUR LIFE?\nOn an average day, I will try to avoid bringing my son to school myself as he will often convince me make a detour to somewhere else, like McDonald’s! Hahah.\xa0I will go down to the wet market to hunt for fresh produce.\nThen I would go and help the team prepare for the lunch orders. I would sometimes have lunch with them. I would then work on social media posts, R&D and on the dinner orders. I try and spend some quality time with my son later, and then, later in the evening, work on administrative matters and of course on social media — both for work and for unwinding!\nI LOVE HOW HONEST AND BLUNT YOU SOMETIMES ARE ON SOCIAL MEDIA, BUT DO YOU EVER WORRY THAT WILL AFFECT YOUR BUSINESS?\nI think it overall aids my business. There are many times when I am out making food deliveries for Indocin, I get to meet my female customers. When they see me, they will give me a packet of candy or even a fruit and share with me how they started a home-based business as they were inspired by my endeavours. \xa0Social media definitely helps create visibility and also helps generate feedback and appreciation. However it does take quite some time to handle social media, and there have been times that people have not been happy with what I said on social media. I have gotten my fair share of nasty comments!\nHOW DO YOU STAY MOTIVATED AND INSPIRED?\nTo be honest, my customers’ feedback is my motivation. I review every single customers’ feedback. The good feedback keep me motivated, the bad ones inspire me to be better.\nYOU HAVE A YOUNG SON. IF HE SAID HE WANTED TO BE A CHEF OR A RESTAURATEUR WHEN HE GETS OLDER, WILL YOU ENCOURAGE HIM?\nI will encourage him to do so only later in life, after he has given me a grandchild to play with. Hahaha. Working in this industry is really time consuming. Many of my colleagues don’t have time for their spouses or families. Sometimes, I have to force them to take mandatory leave, because work can feel never-ending.\nANY COOL UPCOMING NEWS OR PLANS YOU WANT TO SHARE?\nCurrently we are entering our 3rd phase of R&D for our Hainanese iberico satay. It will be available at Century Bakkwa in mid-September 2021 for a limited time only. Look out for it.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Creative Capital ', '     Asian food ', '     food ', ""     Women's Life ""]}"

      Commentary: Nando’s chicken shortage reflects the logistical nightmare restaurants face in a pandemic
  </h1>, 'text': 'LANCASTER, England: Peri-peri chicken fans were disappointed and frustrated when Nando’s announced the temporary closure of nearly 50 restaurants across the UK.\nA chicken shortage has been blamed, and while reactions to the closures were satirised on social media, the problem is a serious challenge for the company.\nHungry customers will no doubt be asking whether the supply could have been better managed. Similar questions were more widely raised at the beginning of the pandemic when supermarkets ran out of toilet roll and flour.\nSome blamed poor planning by retailers, but spikes of demand like this had not been seen before. And the pandemic continues to disrupt established supply chains.\nA recent shortage of microchips for example is partly due to increased demand for appliances such as phones and games consoles, and a resurgence of coronavirus cases in Asia (where most microchips are made).\nThe situation is so serious that Toyota is being forced to temporarily cut vehicle production by 40 per cent.\nPandemics aside, patterns in demand for goods generally show fluctuations from day to day and from week to week. Some of these are explainable and predictable, for example because of known periods of high demand, like Bank Holiday weekends.\nOther changes defy explanation or prediction and are described in statistical forecasting models as “noise”. And although the nature of the next “noise disturbance” is not known, its impact can be measured and taken into account when setting stock levels.\nBut even this careful approach breaks down when there is a sudden spike in demand, unlike anything that has previously occurred.\nThe current shortages of chicken at Nando’s are due to disruptions in supply, rather than demand, which could not necessarily have been expected.\nFrom a forecasting perspective, sudden changes in supply are similar to sudden changes in demand. Inventory control systems usually base their stock calculations on a regular lead time (the length of time from placing an order to when the product arrives and is ready for the customer).\nIf there are occasional minor variations in the lead time, the calculations can be adjusted accordingly. But again, such an approach breaks down if there is a sudden major problem unlike any others that have gone before.\nIn this situation, we should have some sympathy for Nando’s. It would be incredibly wasteful of them to carry large stocks of raw chicken in anticipation of a possible major disruption.\nIf they were to do this in normal times, a significant proportion of meat would be unused and go off. Clearly, this is not a viable solution.\nInstead, the problem of major disruptions calls for a different approach to forecasting, known as scenario planning.\nThe problem at Nando’s seems to have been caused by labour shortages at their suppliers. And while the timing of labour shortages could not have been anticipated, their occurrence – at some point – could have been foreseen.\nIn a scenario planning exercise, managers imagine major causes of disruption that could happen in the future. This sort of exercise will never be perfect, and some events will remain uncovered, but this should not deter progress being made by thinking through potential supply chain problems and the company’s response.\nFor example, if an organisation is reliant on a single supplier for a product, then they may consider introducing a second supplier, who will also receive regular orders and can flex to respond to higher order volumes if there are problems at the first supplier.\nThis can also help to address responses to unexpected spikes in demand. And if a problem affects all suppliers, then plans can be put in place to order larger quantities of substitute products.\nAs a general rule though, the demand forecasting methods embedded in supply chain software should work well in normal times and can be used with confidence as the basis for stock replenishment planning.\nTo anticipate extraordinary times, forecasting needs to shift from a system-based to a human-based activity. Managers should attempt to foresee the major causes of shocks to their supply chains and put in place policies that will mitigate their effect.\nThis will be beneficial not only to restaurant chains in developed economies, but also to humanitarian supply chains in which food, clothing and medicines are desperately needed.\nJohn Boylan is Professor of Business Analytics at Lancaster University.

      Novel food solutions for a more sustainable future
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Shredded and minced mock meat made from young jackfruit grown and harvested in Sri Lanka has found its way onto the plates of diners in Singapore and Hong Kong.\nFounded three years ago, Singapore-based Karana has found a way to turn\xa0jackfruit into a plant-based substitute for pork, using just four ingredients and a proprietary processing method.\nJackfruit has long been eaten and enjoyed in the region, but these new uses of a traditional fruit are leveraging on its perceived natural meat-like qualities.\nIt also has impeccable sustainability credentials - jackfruit grows so abundantly that an estimated 60 per cent of the world’s jackfruit crop goes to waste. \xa0\nKarana’s founders are on a mission to scale up and in effect, help ease the region’s food waste problems.\n“By utilising this under-utilised source, we\'re able to reduce that waste, promote biodiversity, and give additional income streams to smallholder farmers,” said Mr Blair Crichton, co-founder of Karana\nKarana is doubling down on research and development as it looks to explore new crops and ingredients that have gone under the radar in the region.\nTraditionally, Asia has been a major agricultural basket for the world.\nMore than 90 per cent of global output of rice as well as more than 30 per cent of corn are produced in Asia. But the region’s crop yields are growing vulnerable to severe heat and flooding due to climate change.\nAccording to the Food and Agriculture Organization, Asia’s agriculture sector suffered US$49 billion in losses between 2008 and 2018 due to disasters.\nShould Asia’s crop yields become volatile and grain prices rise by more than 100 per cent in the next three decades, around 750 million people below the poverty line will be affected, said McKinsey.\nWith the global population set to hit 10 billion by 2050, experts say a switch to plant-based proteins could be a solution.\nGlobally, about a third of available land is used for agricultural purposes. The majority of this is for livestock pasture. A large proportion of food crop production is also channelled into animal feed. This is not sustainable in the long run, said experts.\nAgriculture and deforestation also account for more than 20 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. And livestock is expected to lead the rise in the sector’s emissions over the next 10 years.\nAccording to a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, cultivated meat using renewable energy could reduce global warming impacts by 17 per cent versus conventional chicken production, 52 per cent against pork production, and 85 to 92 per cent compared to beef production.\nThis could lead to many business opportunities, said experts.\n“Today, the market for alternative proteins is about 1 per cent of total meat consumption. Looking ahead, given the drivers on climate and environmental awareness, the focus on health and well-being, alternative proteins could amount to up to 11 per cent of meat consumption by 2035. And this is a US$300 billion market. With an upside of up to 22 per cent. So it\'s fairly substantial,” said Mr Dave Sivaprasad is Southeast Asia leader for climate action at Boston Consulting Group.\nGlobal consumption of alternative proteins reached about 13 million metric tonnes in 2020.\nIn funding, more than US$4 billion of global venture capital has flowed into the alternative protein space over the past years.\nFirms in the plant-based alternatives, micro-organisms and animal-cell-based proteins have attracted the biggest investments.\n“We see two areas where there\'s interest and increasing investment. One is in critical steps of technology and in the process of development of alternative proteins, for example, specific ingredients that enhance flavours. The second is investments in scaling production. That refers to increasing the capacity on the extrusion technologies or the other bioreactor technologies that are needed to scale for widespread production,"" said Mr Sivaprasad.\nThe Boston Consulting Group expects plant-based and micro-organism-based substitutes to achieve price parity in the next three to five years.\nCultivated meats will take another decade.\nFor start-ups in the novel food space, experts say it all boils down to the basics.\n“Taste is king and the cost is queen. So we need to consider both. Food innovation needs to be simple and cost effective because only then is the scalability there. If you scale up a particular process to make novel food, the cost is always important to keep it within the reach of consumers,” said Professor William Chen is director of the food science and technology programme at Nanyang Technological University.\nFor Karana, the journey to turn jackfruit into a pork substitute has been a welcome challenge.\n""It’s tough to replicate that whole sensory experience of meat. We\'re still improving but by and large, when people try our product, they\'re pretty blown away by it. We\'re not altering the structure of the ingredient. We\'re just finding ways that we can push it in the direction to make it a better experience for consumers,"" said Mr Crichton.\nIn the next two months, Karana’s ready-to-cook dim sum products will start retailing in supermarkets. It’s hoping the health benefits of young jackfruit will be a major draw for buyers.\nKarana estimates that a third of Singapore consumers are interested in flexitarian diets, meaning they actively reduce the amount of meat consumed.\nStill, it will take a while before alternative proteins become a staple in people’s diets.\n“A big part of it comes down to consumer choice and consumer habits. These typically take many years to shift. But we see the momentum picking up. Our projections show by 2035, about two-thirds of the alternative proteins will be consumed in Asia,” said Mr Sivaprasad.\nConsumer education, regulations and risk assessment of processes will be crucial in growing the alternative protein market.\nFor now, consumers can play their part in the sustainability agenda by being mindful of what is on their plate.\nThe next move, according to Professor Chen, will be to move the technology beyond Singapore.\n“Because the impact will be greater, and then the market demand will be greater too. So in a way, we will be helping to enhance regional food security.”\n\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     Money Mind ', '     food ', '     health ']}"

      Commentary: Losing that pandemic weight gain is a lot more complicated than eating less
  </h1>, 'text': 'LIVERPOOL, England: People around the world ate a lot more during the pandemic. \nThe latest figures by Public Health England suggest that more than 40 per cent of British adults gained an average of 3kg during the pandemic.\nThe reasons for the rise in body weights seem, at first glance, obvious. We tended to move less during prolonged periods of lockdown, with emotional eating and gym closures intensifying the trend.\nA look at PHE’s Better Health campaign launched this summer reveals a focus on the “energy balance equation”. This is the idea that excess weight accumulates when food intake, commonly measured in calories, exceeds the body’s use of energy.\nAnd while obesity’s impact on health is by now well-documented, the link between COVID-19 mortality and a body mass index of more than 30, undoubtedly adds a sense of urgency to finally tackling the UK’s expanding waistlines.\nYet a look at the history of dieting and health campaigns should remind us that the realities of weight gain are more complex than “calories in versus calories out”.\nThis raises questions about whether a focus on conventional diets aimed at reducing energy simply by counting calories are really likely to adequately address the issue of excess body weight gained during the pandemic.\nWeight-loss diets in the UK first increased in popularity when rationing gave way to a burgeoning consumer culture and affluence in the 1950s and 60s.\nCommon weight-loss regimes initially tended to focus on curbing the consumption of carbohydrates. But towards the end of the 1960s, low-fat approaches and calorie counting became much more widespread.\nAt the same time, scientists became increasingly concerned with the connections between body weight and heart disease.\nResearch began to emerge documenting the detrimental effects of obesity, such as the Framingham Heart Study or Build and Blood Pressure Study. And although rates were still comparatively small, by the late 1960s concerns were such that they led to the foundation of the Obesity Association in 1967.\nDespite the rising focus on these health problems and with dieting, since the 1960s, people around the world – especially in Western countries – have been gaining weight.\nGlobal obesity levels are now nearly three times what they were in 1975. Rates doubled in the UK between 1980 and 1991, and today the country has the third highest rate of obesity in Europe.\nYou might assume that in line with these changes, the amount of calories that people in the UK were eating also went up.\nBetween 1950 and 2000, the National Food Survey monitored the diets of households in Great Britain. Its seemingly paradoxical data shows that calorie consumption in the post-war years actually decreased, even as obesity rates went up.\nThis apparent contradiction is linked to the increase of fat in the national diet from the mid-1960s onwards. But parallel to a change in nutrition, Britons also became more sedentary than ever before, with car ownership and motorised travel, for instance, sharply increasing since the early 1950s.\nIt illustrates that there’s more to weight loss than just trying to reduce your calories, and that we have to consider the wider picture of what’s going on with people’s lives.\nThe same issue has been highlighted during the pandemic. For example, the Food Standard’s Agency’s report on Food in a Pandemic emphasises that during the first lockdown a higher proportion of the population shopped locally, consumed home-cooked meals and reported eating healthier.\nThe report found that there was a probable link with the increase in the time available for food-related activities due to working-from-home orders and furlough schemes. And yet on average, many people still gained weight.\nThe reality is that the extra time granted by the ability to work at home during during lockdown can be mostly associated with higher income earners. Levels of food insecurity, as well as a lack of time spent at home, would have prevented many on lower incomes from making similar healthy food choices.\nIn the face of ever-increasing obesity, a focus on diets has clearly proved futile over the last 70 years or so. From not eating any bread or potatoes to consuming as little as 500 calories a day, there were hundreds of diets throughout the 20th century that promised but failed to deliver.\nYet today, public health campaigns still seem focused on the simplistic message of getting people to consume fewer calories.\nVery little, if any, progress has been achieved since the recognition of obesity as a priority for public health in 1998. Obesity is not a conscious lifestyle choice and the continued focus on individualised solutions and self-regulation fails to recognise the health inequalities that the pandemic has unmasked and aggravated.\nIdeally, the issue of weight gain during the pandemic should prompt us to re-think such conventional methods for weight loss and place more focus on root causes and integrated approaches.\nMyriam Wilks-Heeg is Lecturer in Twentieth Century History at the University of Liverpool.

      Commentary: Singaporeans are proving you can grow your vegetables and eat them too
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Each morning, when I step out of my back gate with my two-year-old before sending him to school, I am excited to point out a new bud bursting or another edible item ready for harvest. \nHe would point out a blue pea flower or even a bright red chilli not there the day before.\nOnce in a while, we spot an orange flower and cross our fingers for a pumpkin, but the Singapore weather means such flowers usually wither within a few days. \nThere is great pity when that happens but therein lies lesson number one: Gardening is about the circle of life, of things dying as much as it is about the most suitable and carefully tended plants flourishing. \nFruits of our labour have a literal meaning to gardeners. My son has yet to take a liking to our green great hog plums, more affectionately known to us as kedondongs, but we point out the dishes prepared with it to him at the dining table.\nAnd it is a labour of love. My edible garden was once an infertile, small grass patch when we first moved in. \nBut thanks to my father who developed an interest in his retirement years and decided to try growing species that could be used in the kitchen, a luscious plot of flowering plants lies before us today.\nGardening is also about community and sharing in our collective labouring. \nIt helps that I live in an estate of avid gardeners who readily share tips and their harvests of cherry tomatoes and jackfruits. Moringa, banana and mango trees grow freely in the neighbourhood – reminiscent of the kampung days of Singapore, my father said. \nWith more time spent at home, Singaporeans have been getting their hands dirty and discovering a whole new world of horticulture. \nLocal commercial farms, like Edible Garden City, have seen a surge in volunteer applications, along with an increase in the number of calls asking for home gardening advice.\nThe Urban Farmers (Singapore) Facebook group saw a surge in membership since the onset of the pandemic. Members of the 48,000-strong group post about harvest successes, pro tips and the latest horticulture trends. Some users even swap plant cuttings and seeds.\nMeanwhile, NParks has been distributing free seed packets to households through their Gardening with Edibles initiative. Many of my friends and family took full advantage and now have a small edible garden in their homes too.\nStuck together due to pandemic restrictions, my friends Valerie Lo, 29, and Francis Woo, 31, decided to start a home garden together. Tending to their starfruit, asparagus and melon plants at the end of a long day proved to be a great way to destress.\nNow veteran gardeners, they plan to secure a plot of land to experiment with other vegetables and fruits.\nCOVID-19 has caused us to pause, reflect and invest in tomorrow. “Gardening is all in the future, and the less future people have, the more they tend to think about it,” famed public intellectual Germaine Greer once said.\nThe gardening movement is only set to grow. NParks aims to increase the number of community gardens and allotment gardens by up to three times, to 3,000 of each by 2030. \nThe Community in Bloom initiative, a nationwide gardening movement, has seen over 40,000 gardening enthusiasts volunteer to care for farms or lease gardening plots in over 1,600 community gardens.\nDo our inclinations to grow plants at our doorsteps translate into a desire for more locally grown foods? \nThere is a practical side to pushing for local gardening on a commercial level. Rising interest in gardening and urban farming fits into the broader picture of Singapore’s food security aspirations. \nSingapore relies heavily on imported food. We import more than 90 per cent of our nutritional needs from about 170 countries – but hope to produce 30 per cent of our nutritional needs by 2030 under the “30 by 30” goal.\nThe pandemic has been a wake-up call to look inwards in terms of food security. We might remember waking up to empty shelves and snaking queues at our supermarkets in March 2020, when fears over the availability of food triggered panic buying.\nBut can local produce take off?\nFarmers face high operating and capital costs. Land and manpower are expensive. Our farms also spend on marketing and outreach to grow their customer bases.\nAccording to a survey by Urban Origins, an overwhelming majority of Singaporeans are aware that local produce is fresher, more sustainable and that buying them contributes to the local economy. But buyers baulk at the price tag – local produce can cost up to 20 per cent more than imported produce.\nHowever, cost is set to be less of an issue. Farmers and food scientists are optimistic that prices of locally grown food will decrease as economies of scale are met.\nThis looks set to happen in Singapore. Lim Chu Kang, where many traditional vegetable farms are situated, will be redeveloped to take Singapore’s agri-tech capabilities to the next level.\nWith upgraded water, electricity and transport infrastructure to support high-tech farming, Lim Chu Kang could more than triple its current food production.\nSince COVID-19 revealed how vulnerable the status quo of importing food is, Edible Garden City founder Bjorn Low said smaller scale, decentralised urban farms on rooftops of malls and even carparks are the way forward. And Singaporeans are on board.\n“We are optimistic about ’30 by 30’, with the government strongly pushing urban farming by injecting funding and spreading awareness among locals. We have also personally noticed more Singaporeans supporting local agriculture, and choosing to buy local produce over imported varieties,” he said.\nThere’s room for improvement. Local agriculture companies could do more to meet the demands of Singaporean consumers.\nMany focus on growing more commercially viable, high-value crops such as kale instead of vegetables more commonly found in our hawker culture and local cuisines, such as cabbage, kailan and kangkong.\nThat needed mindset shift among consumers does not have to be a grand, sweeping change – it can start with the humble act of growing basil and thyme by the kitchen window, or visiting the farmers’ market, such as the one held in Kranji Countryside every three months.\nGetting involved in community farms is a good start for us, especially young ones, to appreciate the time and effort that go into growing something from farm to table.\nToday, my mother-in-law who stays with us and helps out with cooking is the main caretaker of the plants in our house.\nShe finds joy in plucking the chilis and planting new kinds of seeds. She proudly tells my son that the lady’s fingers he eats are grown from our garden every time she prepares them.\nJust as it takes a village to raise a child, it takes a community to sow the seeds of appreciation among our young of how food reaches our plate. So start now, start at home and soak in the tenderness of cultivating your own food. It can be a tonic in these trying times.\nSuzanna Tang is Co-Founder of Urban Origins, a ground-up initiative connecting communities with local urban food.

      Creative Capital: He serves delicious gifts from the sea at his one-man restaurant
  </h1>, 'text': 'Singapore is home to all kinds of restaurants representing cultures and cuisines from around the world. We have restaurants, helmed by both local and foreign chefs, that are on par with the very best in the world. We have been for decades and continue to be one of the best places in the world to eat.\nOne kind of restaurant I have been tracking more recently is something you see a lot in countries like Japan, but on our shores, are rarities – restaurants owned and operated by a single chef who does everything, from the front of house to the cooking and cleaning, by him or herself. One such restaurant is Ovenbird, which opened less than half a year ago, after having existed as a private dining experience for several years.\nChef-owner Jeffrey Yeo is an untrained former Navy man who is humble, passionate and has been able to develop a devoted and loyal following of friends and patrons. Several of my friends are among his fans. Over the last few months, each of them has individually implored me to check out what he is doing, promising me I will love his food. And while I have a reservation (for September) I decided I would check with him now and get to know him and his story. \nHI JEFFREY, HAVE YOU ALWAYS BEEN AN AVID COOK?\nI started pottering around the kitchen 12 years ago when I was living in Tiong Bahru, right across the street from the market. It wasn’t a particularly great time in my life. There were lots of changes – unhappy ones – but I found solace and a lot of fun in cooking my own meals, and putting food on the table for my friends as they gathered at my pad for a drink or two. \nThings sort of took off from there, and as my life sorted itself out – met a girl, got married, had kids – cooking became a big part of my family life. The biggest step was perhaps when I started taking over CNY cooking duties from my mum five years ago. That was a big deal.\nWHAT WAS THE GENESIS FOR OVENBIRD? \nOvenbird is my wife’s nickname for me. When we were dating, I’d be slaving over meals by the oven, and then off in a flash, like a bird taking off, to do my Ironman training and then back again to serve the meal. That’s the story behind the name. The Ovenbird Facebook page was borne out of necessity to catalogue my cooking adventures. I’m glad I did that because a lot of great memories were captured in the posts. \nWHEN DID YOU START OFFERING PRIVATE DINING?\nAround 2015, not long after I started Ovenbird’s Home Cooking Adventures. I figured it was a nice idea to host strangers who were game enough to eat food prepared by a home cook. It was about meeting people, sharing food, practising my cooking, and having a great time making new friends. I broke out my bottles of wines – I’ve been a wine geek for a while – and from my earlier “private dining” sessions, I met many friends who are now scattered across the globe. \nBecause I never spent a single day in F&B, I didn’t know there was a term to describe what I was doing. I called it my “Experimental Kitchen” back then. \nAND WHAT MADE YOU WANT TO GO FROM COOKING FOR FRIENDS AND LOVED ONES TO START SERVING PAYING CUSTOMERS? \nTo be honest, the transition wasn’t a conscious decision. I enjoyed cooking and meeting new people, and there were new people, total strangers, who loved this kind of experience, so it just occurred naturally. \nHOW HAS YOUR FOOD EVOLVED OVER THE YEARS?\nSo here’s the deal. I never had any formal culinary training. Never really considered myself a foodie by any measure. My interest in food started simply with me trying out heritage recipes passed down from my mum – dishes I remembered eating as a kid, like my grandma’s food. \nAnd because I love my wines, I travelled to Europe quite a bit back then and becoming interested in Italian and French food. So I started experimenting with recipes. But I guess the more I cooked, the more cross-cultural influences I’ve been able to introduce into my recipes. \nThe biggest evolution – the giant leap that led me to what I’m cooking now – was when I bought my first Japanese knife, a Sakai Kikumori Yanagiba, in 2017. The minute I picked up that knife, and the 90 or so after that, I delved into the art of Japanese cooking as best I could, without knowing the language, or having travelled to Japan at the time, or having eaten at a high-end sushiya or kappou restaurant in Singapore. \nWHAT DO YOU CALL YOUR FOOD? IS IT MOD SIN, JAPANESE, OR SOMETHING ELSE?\nI guess I start with the main produce, which 90 per cent of the time, involves a seasonal fish from Japan. And that means almost always working the fish as a sashimi, or involving some form of curing – Shoyuzuke, Misozuke, Sakekasu, etc. I will then work in seasonal vegetables and work out saucing around the fish. I think as a rank amateur and being utterly untrained, save for a six-week “tourism” sushi course at the Tokyo Sushi Academy, I have to work within my limitations. \nWHAT CHEFS OR RESTAURATEURS INSPIRE YOU? \nI run a one-man restaurant. Never did I imagine that I’d ever work in a restaurant let alone own one. But if there was anyone who has given me the confidence and the inspiration to do what I am doing now, it is Chef Javier Low of Iru Den, even though he doesn’t know me. He probably doesn’t even recall that I dined at his one-man project three or four years ago. But that dinner was life changing. To put one’s entire heart, soul and craft into running a small restaurant is exactly what every home cook does for his or her family every day. It’s a labour of love. \nMy first trip to Japan in 2018 gave me the opportunity to dine at one-chef and at family-run izakayas, sushiyas, and ramen joints. The pride and effort they put in, day in day out, and how that is all rooted in a tradition of hospitality and community, those establishments really inspired me. \nIF YOU COULD COOK FOR ONE SMALL GROUP OF DREAM DINERS, WHO WOULD YOU INVITE? \nI would love to cook for Chef Javier. That’s one. \nThe next person would have to be my Sensei at the Tokyo Sushi Academy, Chef Hiro, who pretty much taught me what little I know about sushi making and Washoku. \nThen there’s Hashinokouchi-san and his wife. They’re an inspirational couple who own an izakaya near Nihonbashi where I stayed at during my sushi course in Tokyo. They made me a Singapore-style herbal Bak Kut Teh using seasonal ingredients and a fusion of cooking styles when I was there – paired with seasonal sake, wines from Yamanashi. \nThe last two group of people I’d love to cook for would be my original group of Japanese guests who are expats working in Singapore. They’ve journeyed with me from my home cook days up until today.\nWHEN AND WHY DID YOU DECIDE TO OPEN A PROPER RESTAURANT?\nTo be honest, I had no choice but to open a restaurant if I wanted to continue to serve what I loved most, raw fish. I had a visit from the SFA back in Sep 2020; they had received “feedback” about me preparing and serving sashimi at home. Partly because of this, a new regulation was implemented that essentially banned home cooks from preparing and serving raw, ready to eat seafood. It wasn’t a food poisoning case, as no food samples were taken. And it all took place in a space of two or three weeks. \nI wasn’t the only one affected; there was another home chef who is a trained sushi chef and he had to cease his private dining practice as well. I could have reverted to cooked food and continued my private dining practice, but I didn’t want up give up sashimi, which is a big part of what I do – especially aged sashimi. So I put all the savings I have, scrounged up whatever else was needed from my wife and family, and sunk it all into Ovenbird the restaurant.\nWHAT WAS YOUR PREVIOUS CAREER? \nI started my work life as an SAF Scholar. I was a Navy man. Then, I spent about a decade in healthcare operations. My last full time job was as a sports director at Singapore Sports School working with young student athletes.\nWHAT DO YOU WISH YOU HAD KNOWN ABOUT THE F&B INDUSTRY BEFORE BECOMING A FULL-TIME RESTAURATEUR? \nWhere do I begin! If I’d been 15 years younger, I’d sink myself into the toughest apprenticeship in a Kaiseki restaurant, provided there was one willing to take me. I would have loved to have gotten that kind of formal training and the experience of working in a real Japanese kitchen. \nI would also have liked to have trained in a traditional French brigade style kitchen. Because I don’t have the experience of working with others in a kitchen, right now, it’s easier, I guess, that I run my shop alone. If I had to work with a team, I’d be an unmitigated disaster.\nWHAT’S THE BEST THING ABOUT WHAT YOU DO? \nThe conversations I have with my guests and friendships we develop over the course of time. It’s very easy to get sucked into one’s own existence in a vacuum, and it’s worse during the pandemic. But right now, having that connection with my guests, it’s the best thing. \nAND WHAT IS THE TOUGHEST? \nBeing away from Edith, my eight-year-old daughter; Esme, my three-year-old girl, and my wife. We’re a close family. I took year-long breaks in my career to be a stay-home dad when my girls were born. Being away from them, it’s tough. Especially for Edith. I see her only two nights a week, Sunday and Monday. And she’s really growing up too fast. \nWHAT IS THE BIGGEST MISCONCEPTION PEOPLE HAVE ABOUT YOU? \nI don’t really know. Some people say I’ve got a lot of talent, but I don’t think I have anything close to what can be described as talent. What I have is the courage to pursue what I love and do it all the way. I try to make every day in the kitchen a great one for myself and those who I cook for. \nHOW HAS THE PANDEMIC AFFECTED YOUR BUSINESS? \nIt hasn’t ruined me financially, but that’s after four months of Ovenbird being run as a commercial concern. I guess, being so small, the dining-in restriction doesn’t hit me as hard. The enforced no dining-in periods haven’t killed me either, as I was able to pivot to a takeout model quite easily. But that’s really because I work alone. \nThe wear and tear comes from the extra hours I have to put in to do takeaways, and that takes a toll on my physical health. Apart from that, the fear that Ovenbird would somehow become a cluster is always hanging over my head. That is my number one fear. \nWHAT IS YOUR VISION FOR OVENBIRD? \nAs a newcomer to the scene, I think being able to survive in my current model – a one- man restaurant – is what I’m focused on. It’s something not all too common in Singapore, unless you count hawkers. In fact, I always tell my friends that I’m a hawker in a mall. Basically, I hope that this new career I have chosen will be able to last at least two decades.\nI UNDERSTAND YOU ARE A KNIFE GUY. ANY FAVOURITE CAN’T-LIVE-WITHOUT PIECES? ANY PIECES YOU ARE SAVING UP FOR? \nKnives…where do I start. The 150mm Mizuno Tanrenjo Ai-Debra is my most heavily used knife and therefore the favourite I can’t live without. Made by my friend Mizuno-Jun san who is a remarkable knife maker from Sakai, this knife is used to fillet 70 per cent of all my fish. \nI guess I’m not really saving up for a dream knife, not at the moment at least. But I do have in mind to get a heavier Hamokiri (400mm) as I improve my honekiri technique working on Hamo.\n', 'related_topics': ['     food ', '     Chefs ', '     Creative Capital ']}"

      A ‘miracle’ once saved these hawkers’ lives. Their stall is now battling to survive again
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: There are nine types of vadai (deep-fried lentil fritters) on sale at Gina Rajan’s stall at Dunman Food Centre, such as dhal, prawn, vegetable and ikan bilis vadai.\nThey all have one thing in common, according to her.\n“My vadai is very crispy on the outside, soft on the inside — when you have one bite, you feel like eating more,” the 63-year-old said about the Indian snack made to her late husband’s secret recipe.\nShe has been selling vadai since 1985. Her stall, Gina’s Vadai, has moved multiple times, from its original premises in Geylang Bahru to Simpang Bedok and other locations before it settled in Dunman Food Centre in 2017.\nIt has not been easy to survive this long, she tells the programme On The Red Dot\xa0about her\xa0fluctuating fortunes\xa0over the years which have\xa0taken her\xa0from the pits of hopelessness and grief, to the heady high of success.\nWATCH: Widow behind Gina’s Vadai fights to keep husband’s legacy alive (4:03)\nNow with the COVID-19 pandemic, business is only getting worse for one of Singapore’s oldest vadai brands.\n\n\nIT STARTED AT HOME\nGina got married to husband James in 1981, and she remembers two things he told her about himself: He loved vadai, and he wanted to open a business.\nThey first started making the snack at home, planning to sell it door to door. Her eldest son, David, who was four or five years old then, even volunteered to help.\nThe now 39-year-old does not remember much, but he recalls trying to sell “50 pieces or so” and getting feedback on his parents’ product. “It was literally just pocket money — spare cash that would help the family,” he says.\nIn 1987, they opened their first stall. “Dad came up with about S$300. And they gathered some pots and pans and frying materials and, through the business, slowly grew to buy other things,” recounts David. “It was really from scratch.”\nAs time passed, they made a name for themselves — perhaps, Gina quips, owing to a name change. Previously their stall was called Born Again Vadai. But a friend of her husband’s suggested that he put her name on the signboard.\n“You’ll see. Your business will boom,” she remembers him saying. “(Sure) enough, the business totally turned around.”\nBY A MIRACLE\nBut in 1994, the demolition of some blocks in the vicinity affected their business. “Because the crowd that (used to) walk past was no longer there,” says David.\nHis parents moved to another stall, in Simpang Bedok. But in a location where no one knew about them, business was bad.\nJames despaired and felt like they should both end it all.\nBut at the last minute, their phone rang. “So he answered the call. A guy said, ‘I need to do some write-up about you and your vadai,’” she recounts. “(The caller) said, ‘My name is Seetoh, from Makansutra.’”\nAfter their vadai was featured in the food guide, the newspapers started calling, she says. Their business was also featured on television. “After the write-up, the queue was super long,” Gina adds. “That was really a miracle.”\nCARRYING ON\nOnce business picked up, James wanted to open more outlets. But in 2009, he died of a heart attack.\n“When he held my hand on the way (to hospital), I was telling him, ‘You don’t have to worry, you take care,’” Gina recalls. “I didn’t know he was going to leave me.”\nSince then, she says through her tears, life has been difficult. Although she tried to hide her emotions and be strong for her three children, they could not help but notice the change in her.\n“It was really emotional (for us to) see her lose the one support that she always felt (she’d have),” says David. The family decided to downsize the business and eventually moved to their current location.\nShe missed her husband. But she never gave up and held fast to what he used to tell her. “He always pushed me, asked me to learn, (to) always trust God (and) carry on with the business,” she says.\n“I still have to take care of this family. I need to survive, so I just carry on my life that way.”\n\n\nRICE BOWL IN DANGER\nBut now, Gina is facing a big drop in customer numbers. Before the pandemic, she could sell at least 300 vadai a day; nowadays, her sales average about 100 pieces a day.\nShe does not offer delivery, she says, as she has no one to do it for her. Customers have requested that she go online, but she does not know how.\nGoing with the food delivery platforms would mean having to sell her vadai for S$1.80 apiece, when people already think S$1 is expensive, she adds. “(At) S$1.80, I’d be saying bye-bye (to them).”\nWhen it comes to food deliveries, the hawker option also tends to be overlooked, according to food blogger Leslie Tay.\n“A packet of chicken rice (is) S$5 or S$4, and then you’ve got to pay the delivery fee. It just doesn’t make much sense,” he says.\n(So) people … buy something of a higher value, and then the delivery charge makes sense.\nCompared to hawkers selling meals, snack sellers face even greater uncertainty. “A lot of the sales for snacks come from people wandering around,” says food blogger Seth Lui. “In the COVID-19 situation, people do less of that.\n“A lot of people are coming out to just purchase lunch and dinner. And they don’t really want to stay out long, so I think the chance of an impulse buy is lowered.”\nWATCH: Hawker snacks: Why are they more affected by the pandemic? (23:23)\nGina is especially affected whenever COVID-19 restrictions are tightened and dining out is suspended.\n“Say we’re starting to fry … (but) they don’t want to wait,” she says, citing customers who say they are in a rush or have a car waiting. “That kind of situation (is what) we’ve gone through. It’s not easy.”\nTHE QUESTION OF SUCCESSION\nGina is carrying on as best as she can. But a question also remains as to whether her business can continue after she retires.\nDavid once had to run the stall on his own — when his mother went to India to get treatment for a head injury.\n“I was struggling with it and eventually picked it up. But it couldn’t work for (me in terms of) income and Mum’s income as well,” he says.\n“We’re still trying to figure out how we can mass-produce (the vadai), because that’s the only way forward.”\nAt present he is reluctant to quit his “stable” job to take over the stall. He is a property agent who also does some interior design.\nFor children of hawkers, he says, giving up a career to take over the family business can be akin to “starting from zero”.\nWhile his family has had offers for their recipe, he discloses, his mother is “very sentimental” about it and “wouldn’t want the recipe to go to anybody else”.\nShe has not given up hope that her children will take over. “In future, I’ll just pass the recipe to them. I’ll say, ‘Whenever you all really want to do (it), you all do (it),’” she says.\n“Mummy won’t force (you), but this is what your father told me to do.”\nWatch this episode of On The Red Dot here.

      Commentary: Plenty of fish in the sea? Seafood-loving Singapore may not have its fill in the future
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The Netflix documentary Seaspiracy has triggered discussion about the ills of the global seafood industry.\nWhile it got blowback for its sensationalism and quoting studies out of context, the film has shone a spotlight on issues such as overfishing and plastic pollution, convincing many viewers to swear off seafood.\nBut is abstaining from seafood consumption really the solution?\n\n\nThat doesn’t sound like an easy task when Singaporeans love seafood. Each person consumes an average of 22kg of seafood per year, above the global average of around 20kg.\nIn 2020, Singapore imported 134,000 tonnes of seafood worth S$760 million, mostly from countries in the region such as Indonesia and Malaysia.\nBut this rate of seafood imports might give one pause given the finite number of fish in oceans and Singapore’s food security goals.\n\n\nA SEAFOOD-LOVING NATION\nA 2016 report by WWF revealed that 75 per cent of the seafood consumed in Singapore is unsustainable, meaning they are irresponsibly fished or farmed.\xa0\nA notorious industrial fishing method is bottom trawling, in which a large fishing net is used to comb the seabed. The net collects everything in its path, including juvenile fish, turtles and marine mammals, and destroys coral reefs in the process.\nSpecies that are trawled include ikan kuning (the fish typically served in nasi lemak), silver pomfret and swordtip squid.\nYet, Singapore is highly dependent on these imports. Over 90 per cent of the food we eat is imported, with only 9 per cent of fish\xa0produced in local farms, according to the Singapore Food Agency (SFA).\nThis makes Singapore vulnerable to temporary shocks in supply chains. The Jurong Fishery Port, a source of a growing COVID-19 cluster, has been closed for deep cleaning until Jul 31, causing short-term disruptions to the supply of chilled seafood. The Ministry of Health noted on Jul 17 that there was a rush to buy fish and urged visitors to avoid crowds when marketing.\nIt’s therefore no surprise that Singapore aims to beef up its food security with its “30 by 30” goal: To produce 30 per cent of its nutritional needs locally by 2030.\nTHE GLOBAL PICTURE\nBut the problem goes beyond Singapore. Worldwide, seafood consumption has reached 156 million tonnes every year. The United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimated global fish consumption per capita more than doubled from 9kg in 1961 to 20.5kg in 2018.\nThe annual growth in seafood consumption has outpaced population growth twofold and is higher than the growth in consumption of all other animal proteins.\nThe world’s insatiable appetite for seafood has led to overfishing and resulting declining fish populations. In 1974, 90 per cent of the world’s fish stocks were at healthy levels. That figure dropped to 65.8 per cent in 2017, according to FAO.\nFifty years ago in Thailand, 300kg of seafood could be fished per hour. Today, only 18kg of seafood can be fished per hour.\n\n\nFarming practices such as aquaculture can fill the shortfall in consumer demand for seafood. But aquaculture has also been associated with environmentally harmful practices, including overfishing, ironically, when an unsustainable number of wild fish is caught to feed the farmed fish.\nThere’ve been health scares linked to cultivated seafood too. For instance, the US Food and Drug Administration issued an import alert in 2016 on shrimp and prawns from Malaysia, alleging the presence of antibiotics that prevent disease in farmed crustaceans, but are harmful to humans.\nThe ongoing pandemic has added another layer of complexity. According to a recent FAO information paper, the slowdown in consumer demand, disruption to fishing supplies and health measures for crew members have all affected the seafood industry.\nIn the US, fishing catches dropped by 40 per cent at the peak of COVID-19.\nWith all these stresses on the seafood industry, it’s time to think about the bigger questions during our trips to the supermarket.\nSUSTAINABLE SEAFOOD LABELS – A GUARANTEE?\nOne solution to the depletion of fish stocks is to eat responsibly. The big boys know this trend is on the horizon. Marina Bay Sands, for instance, is starting to use more certified sustainable products in their kitchens with Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) being the dominant seafood sustainability certifier.\nMSC labels caught or farmed seafood as sustainable based on three criteria: Using sustainable fish stocks, minimising environmental impact and effective management.\nOther certifiers include the Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC) and the Global Aquaculture Alliance’s Best Aquaculture Practice (BAP).\nStill, there’s understandable public scepticism over sustainable seafood labels, not to mention the green-washing risk of seafood being wrongfully claimed as sustainable, or simply mislabelled. In 2018, CNA enlisted a laboratory to test eight samples of certified sustainable fish, and found one product did not match its packaging label of Pacific cod.\n\n\nNonetheless, seafood labels do go some way to raise public awareness about sustainable seafood and guide consumers in making better choices. In a study conducted by consultancy GlobeScan, 75 per cent of people in Singapore felt consumers should protect fish stocks so others can enjoy them in the future.\nBut sustainable seafood is still by far the exception rather than the norm. Walk through the seafood section in a local supermarket and you’ll find that only about one in 10 seafood products have any of the three sustainability labels (MSC, ASC, or BAP).\n\n\nTAKING MATTERS INTO OUR HANDS\nHow should we as consumers prepare ourselves now for the future that we are aware of global threats to seafood availability?\nWe could get educated, for a start. WWF Singapore published a sustainable seafood guide in 2016, identifying species that are sustainable and those that should be avoided.\nBut the industry too must step up. Food vendors today may have no idea whether their fish is sustainable and where it comes from, or even what is in a product such as fish balls.\n\n\nThe good news is that aquaculture using sustainable technology is showing results and gaining support as part of Singapore’s “30 by 30” plan.\nConsumers can now choose from a growing range of seafood products from local farms (like fish, prawns and crabs). Operated and monitored according to the sustainability guidelines by SFA, consumers have less to worry about compared to labels from MSC and the like.\nFood safety of new local aquaculture products will also receive a boost from NTU’s recently launched Future Ready Food Safety Hub (FRESH), which uses data analytics to cut down the risk of food fraud so Singaporeans can feel more confident in these products.\n\n\nInnovations in food science and technology have produced higher nutrient values in familiar seafoods like seabass, groupers and soon hock.\xa0\nFor example, the St John’s sea bass, a new breed developed by SFA and Temasek Life Science Laboratory, is healthier for consumers and easier for farmers to produce.\n\n\nIt’s true the current scale and production yield of Singapore’s aquaculture are not yet comparable with the economies whose seafood exports we rely on.\nThat’s why local innovations should be shared with neighbouring countries, in the hopes that regional collaboration can address the threats to seafood supply. Already, local aquaculture firms Barramundi Asia and Apollo Aquaculture are expanding their operations into Brunei.\nIn the meantime, responsible seafood consumption – such as eating less sambal stingray and steamed red grouper – may be a small way of ensuring that we can continue enjoying these dishes in the years to come.\nHow could climate change reshape your dinner? Listen to an expert break it down on The Climate Conversations podcast:\n\xa0\nProfessor William Chen is the Michael Fam Chair Professor in Food Science & Technology and Host Principal Investigator of the Future Ready Food Safety Hub.\n', 'related_topics': ['     sustainability ', '     food ', '     COVID-19 ']}"

      Hawkers and their heirs struggle with uncertainty — and lack of rental relief
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: A cult following, the thumbs up from food reviewers and an almost superhuman work ethic have kept many traditional food sellers going for decades.\nEven with a successor in sight, however, these ingredients may not be enough to shield their trade from change.\nTake, for example, My Cosy Corner, a shop in Coronation Shopping Plaza famous for its popiah, whose fans include national swimmer Quah Ting Wen and restaurateur Loh Lik Peng.\nOwner Alice Hang’s 29-year-old son Abraham Leong is “constantly surprised” people know about his mother’s shop — which also sells mee siam, mee rebus and laksa — and is proud of what his parents have achieved since 1998.\n“I just want to be able to continue that because it’s a legacy I don’t want to just throw away,” said Leong, who works at a tailor shop and helps them out at My Cosy Corner on weekends.\nBut the closure of even established restaurants owing to the pandemic has shown him the industry’s “thin” profit margins and made him realise “it’s like building a house on sand”.\n“Definitely, I have a lot of uncertainty. That’s one of the few things I think about at night,” he said.\nDuring Singapore’s Phase Two (Heightened Alert) from May 16 to June 13, only takeaways were allowed, and My Cosy Corner’s profits fell by 30 per cent compared to pre-COVID-19 levels.\nBut Hang, 63, did not sign up with delivery service GrabFood. She felt its 30 per cent commission was “very expensive”.\n“If I didn’t increase the price of my food and stuck to the original price, it wouldn’t be worth it,” she said.\nHer son added: “If I open my services to delivery, my existing customers would have to wait even longer during lunchtime. But I’d earn less from delivery because (the service providers) take a cut.”\n\n\nHence delivery “doesn’t really make sense” for them, although he has not ruled out the option. “I understand that … not everyone can afford to drive across the island to get popiah, and sometimes it’s just way more convenient,” he said.\n“I told my mum that we can’t just keep doing the same things (we did) pre-pandemic, because it’s a completely different world out there.”\nThe dining-out ban in Phase Two (Heightened Alert) impacted many hawkers, especially those in business districts, the show On The Red Dot found in its Hawk This Way series.\nIf places like My Cosy Corner shut, “it’d be a tragedy”, said Loh, a customer for over 10 years and the founder of hotel and restaurant group Unlisted Collection.\n\n\nWhile he said some hawkers would do well to adapt better to technology, “the reality is that most of their customers have a hard time conceiving of a different dynamic” of hawker fare — specifically, what they are prepared to pay.\nHe thinks people should change their mindset that hawker food is cheap and not something that should cost them more than S$2 to S$3.\nSLIPPING UNDER THE RADAR, BUT HANGING ON\nWhile stallholders at centres managed by the National Environment Agency and its appointed operators received rental relief and other support, food blogger Leslie Tay noted that these subsidies would not necessarily apply to hawkers operating elsewhere.\nAmong other measures, the Government encouraged commercial landlords to support their food and beverage tenants during the recent phase. “Some are doing well. But the others are also falling under the radar, and they’re on their own,” Tay said.\nAt Jalan Berseh, Teochew fish ball noodle seller Sim Ah Tee operates in a private coffee shop. Like My Cosy Corner, he is not on any food delivery platform.\nSim said he had to pay the full rent even when dining out was not allowed. He earned about S$100 to S$200 a day and sometimes did not make enough to cover rent. Before the pandemic, he could earn S$500 to S$600 a day.\nWATCH: Another dine-in ban: Hawkers without rental waivers\xa0(23:14)\nBut even for a S$3 portion, his noodles are generously topped with lard, minced meat, char siu, fish balls, fishcakes and fish dumplings, he said with pride.\nExplaining his prices, he added: “This neighbourhood has many old people; they usually get the S$3 portion. (They) don’t have much money — how can they afford a S$4 portion?”\nHis stall, Ah Tee Ko Ko Mee, is named after the “kok kok” sound made by street hawkers hitting bamboo pieces to attract customers in the 1970s.\nWhen he was young, his parents did not have money to send him to school. His father roped him in to sell noodles in Sungei Road so that he would not mix with bad company.\n“I pushed the cart, hit the bamboo sticks, walked on the road and earned some money,” he recalled.\nAfter his father died, patrons complained that his skills did not match his father’s. Sim spent a year mastering his craft before business started improving.\nToday, customers such as The 1925 Brewing Co’s co-founder and executive chef Ivan Yeo praise the texture of his noodles, the juiciness of his fishcakes and the crunchiness of his fish balls.\nAt the age of 74, Sim still opens the stall at 5.30am. This means he leaves his home in Tampines by 4am.\nWATCH: 74-year-old fish ball mee hawker can’t\xa0bear to retire after 50 years despite COVID-19 pandemic (3:45)\nTo neighbouring stall operator Nick Yeo, the routine is “really a bit crazy”, especially when there is not much business in the morning. But Sim said customers have eaten his noodles in the morning all this while.\nDespite developing a deformity in his leg, he cannot bear to retire yet. “I’ve already done this for so many decades,” he said.\nMore than a decade ago, he did train his son, Calvin, to take over, and after three years, Sim gave him the capital to open a branch. Calvin initially set up shop in Beach Road before settling in Amoy Street.\nCalvin said he operated the branch for about 10 years before shuttering it owing to rising rent, food and operating costs as well as manpower shortages. The hours were long, and he sacrificed time with his children and wife.\xa0\n""It was really tough,” said the 49-year-old, who had considered the stall his “baby”.\nIt harked back to his childhood — he said he did not spend much time with his father, who worked seven days a week. If his father was short-handed, then Calvin helped out at the stall.\nAccording to Sim, his son does not want to take over after he retires as he believes a salaried job is better.\nBut for Sim, the business has enabled him to raise two children with his wife, and he feels happy and proud when customers compliment his food.\n“If I do retire, I’d keep my bamboo pieces as a memento because (they) have been with me for decades,” he said. “Does anybody want them? If anyone (does), I’d give it to them. Otherwise, I’ll take them home.”\nWatch this episode of On The Red Dot here.

      Double whammy for food buyers as freight costs spike amid high grain prices
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Rising costs to ship crops globally are adding to concerns about food inflation that are already at decade-highs and hitting cost-sensitive consumers in import-dependent markets.\nThe cost of bulk carriers that move grains and oilseeds from production hubs in the Americas and Black Sea to key consumers have roughly doubled from last year due to rising fuel costs, tighter vessel supply and longer port turnaround times amid COVID-19 curbs, according to grain and shipping sources.\n""Freight cost has become a real challenge as it comes when we see huge increases in grain prices,"" said Phin Ziebell, agribusiness economist at National Australia Bank in Melbourne.\n""For years, buyers enjoyed low grain and freight prices. I see no immediate end to high freight costs.""\nThe cost of moving grains from Australia to Southeast Asia has risen to US$30 a tonne from US$15 last year, and to US$55 from US$25 from the US Pacific Northwest to Asia, shipping sources said.\nShips carrying wheat from the Black Sea to Asia now cost around US$65 a tonne, from around US$35 last year.\n""It is the cost of bunker fuel and the cost of bulk ships lifting the prices of carrying grains,"" said one trader at a leading brokerage in Singapore. ""We also have COVID-19 quarantine requirements slowing cargo movement.""\n\n\n\nFUEL TO THE FIRE\nWith world food prices having risen at their fastest pace in over a decade in May, the spike in crop freight costs poses a fresh challenge to food importers and policymakers attempting to keep inflation levels in check just as several key economies reopen following coronavirus lockdowns.\nAnd the price of key crops like corn and soybeans are set to remain elevated and volatile through the rest of the northern hemisphere growing season as crops develop.\nChicago corn futures are up roughly 90 per cent from a year ago on strong global demand and stressed crops in the United States, while soybeans are up more than 50 per cent after drought clipped output in top grower Brazil. Wheat is up around 30 per cent from a year ago following growing problems last season.\nDOUBLE WHAMMY FOR BUYERS\nThe double whammy of higher crop and freight prices is pinching buyers in Asia, the top crop consuming region and home to China that accounts for more than half of the world\'s soybean purchases. Japan is one of the world\'s biggest corn buyers.\nFor a typical wheat buyer in Indonesia, the world\'s second-largest wheat importer, the cost of a 50,000-tonne cargo of food-grade wheat from the Black Sea has jumped by US$4 million from a year ago to around US$15 million, with the freight cost alone rising by US$1.5 million.\nCrop price volatility is another challenge.\nBenchmark corn futures lurched more than 10 per cent higher in the last week of June before slumping 10 per cent the following week as weather forecasts shifted market sentiment.\n""We have seen a drop in consumption with these high prices,"" said a procurement manager at a flour milling company with operations across Southeast Asia.

One woman has become famous on TikTok for making “sandwiches” from raw green peppers, cream cheese and bagel seasoning.\nOn YouTube, there are hundreds of videos in which people try to follow a supermodel’s diet for\xa0the day. Influencers make videos that show every meal and snack they consume, aware that many of their followers want to look just like them.\nThe backlash to these aspirational eating diaries are the videos that deliberately make a virtue of being humdrum. British TikTok star Eden Harvey has amassed over 2 million followers with her daily “eat with me” videos, in which she records herself having a one-sided conversation while eating her dinner, pausing to allow viewers to answer her questions.\nThe food is comforting in its ordinariness: Spaghetti bolognese, sandwiches and chicken kiev. Harvey’s fanbase of viewers often seems skewed towards those who struggle with food issues. Her success is an indication of just how many people, particularly young people, have a difficult relationship with what they eat.\nBut even if that’s not the case, there is something appealing about knowing what another person eats every day. This is not a new phenomenon. One of the most vivid illustrations of life in the 17th century comes from diarist Samuel Pepys’ description of his meals. There is the venison pasty that “stunk like a devil” and the “pretty” dinner that included stewed carps and neats’ tongues.\n\xa0\n\xa0\nYears later, English housewife Nella Last’s wartime diaries are memorable for her make-do recipes, including margarine created from milk, salt and corn flour. Whenever I buy potatoes, I think of the legend that Jackie Onassis’ diet consisted of a single baked potato each day, stuffed with caviar and sour cream.\nIt is not unusual to be interested in the minutiae of someone else’s life either. See the success of Vogue’s online videos showing famous women putting on their make-up and the livestreams of people sleeping or silently revising homework for hours at a time.\nWebsite Refinery29 has found success with its money diaries, in which readers record their exact spending habits over the course of a week. There is a sense of companionship in seeing the banal details of another person’s life – plus the chance to judge.\n\xa0\n\xa0\nWhat the Internet has done is allow more people the ability to film their daily routines and upload the results, sharing them with a bigger audience than ever before.\nPart of the appeal is nosiness. But many of the videos are also designed to make it feel as if the viewer is with a friend. Watching someone eat online seems to help some viewers feel less alone. Dining is a social activity, after all. Perhaps it makes sense that this side of our social lives is moving online, along with everything else.\nBy Elaine Moore © 2021 The Financial Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     Culture & Trends ', '     TikTok ', '     food ']}"

      Singapore’s ageing heritage hawkers hope for successors; one has put up recipe for sale
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Maxwell Food Centre hawker Ng Kok Hua started helping out at his father’s stall when he was in Primary Six. He took over when he was 16 and has been plying his trade ever since.\nIn the beginning, he took a bus to China Street after school to help wash the plates and serve mainland Chinese cuisine to customers.\nAt night when the stall had closed, his father took him to sample other hawker food in nearby Amoy Street, Boon Tat Street or Pickering Street.\n“So (it didn’t feel like) I was coming to help my father, (but rather like) I was coming for the good food,” he recalls.\nWhen he was in Secondary Four, his father fell ill, so Kok Hua left school before his GCE O levels to continue the business and support his nine siblings.\n“As a 16-year-old student, suddenly (I had to) take over the whole stall. It wasn’t easy,” the 64-year-old tells the programme On The Red Dot. “I was thinking the rest of my brothers were all still studying, so no choice.”\nSome five decades later, he still starts his day before sunrise.\nHe heads to Upper Boon Keng Market at 6am to buy items such as bean sprouts, chives, spring onion and pork before meeting his wife, sister and brother at their central kitchen in MacPherson.\nThey spend roughly six hours preparing Hokkien-style ngoh hiang — consisting of meat rolls flavoured with five-spice powder, egg slices, liver rolls and pink sausages — using a recipe passed down from his father.\nHis brother, Richard Ng Kok Eng, 65, arrives at Maxwell Food Centre around 11am to take pre-orders, and the others follow with containers of handmade ngoh hiang an hour later.\nTheir day does not end after closing the stall at about 8pm.\n“We have to go back to our central kitchen to do some preparation for the next day. By the time we reach home, it’d be something like 10.30pm or 11pm. Every day it’s like that,” says Kok Hua.\nThe family-run business, China Street Fritters, is one of only two stalls left in Singapore that sell Hokkien-style ngoh hiang.\nWith plans to retire by next March, the family made the news earlier this year when they offered their recipe for sale at S$1 million.\nKok Hua tells On The Red Dot the sum of money, to be divided among the team who run the business, is “not a lot”.\n“This S$1 million, divided by five, is only S$200,000 per person. It’s for retirement,” he says. “Age is catching up with us. My wife has to go for knee surgery, then I have to go for ankle surgery.”\nNeither his three children nor his brothers’ children are interested in taking over the business, and the team is willing to sell the recipe to an outsider.\nWATCH: One of Singapore’s last handmade Hokkien ngoh hiang may be gone soon (3:22)\nHe has seen a few hawkers at Maxwell Food Centre simply calling it a day when the younger generation was unwilling to take over. “It’s a pity that all the traditional food just goes down the drain,” he says.\nThe median age of Singapore’s hawkers is about 60. And while the challenge of finding successors has simmered for years, COVID-19 has made it even tougher.\n\n\n‘YOU ALL MUST CONTINUE’\nChina Street Fritters saw a potential investor pull out when the pandemic hit.\n“The company said, ‘We’ll hold the project,’” recounts Kok Hua. “It’s because they lost money in other sectors. They weren’t willing to come up with money to invest in other things.”\nRichard chortles as Kok Hua quips: “Maybe it’s fated. Maybe it’s the spirit of our father trying to tell us, ‘You all must continue.’”\nWATCH: A Hokkien ngoh hiang recipe worth S$1 million (2:40)\nAt 63 years old, fellow Maxwell hawker Ng Chow Gee, who sells duck rice and duck noodles, is also hoping that fate intervenes “soon” to bring a successor, since his children are “chasing their dreams”.\nLamenting that “youngsters now aren’t willing to take hardships”, he says he hired “a few young workers” decades ago and taught them how to wash the ducks and prepare the spice mix. But they were not serious about the trade or could not take the rigour.\nHe, too, began by helping his father out. His family lived above their stall on China Street, and as a young boy, he used to walk past everyone’s stalls and look.\n“I’d ask them, ‘What are you cooking now?’ Some, if they were in a bad mood, would say, ‘Kid, just watch, don’t ask so many questions,” he recounts.\nWhen he was 13, his father lost a helper — his elder sister had got married. Chow Gee told his demoralised dad that he would stop studying to help out. The senior Ng told him to “think it through properly”.\n“I said, ‘I won’t regret it. Let me help you.’ From then on, I helped him sell and cook duck rice.”\n\n\nHis father died in 1981, and Chow Gee took over the business. He experimented and developed a recipe using herbs and spices such as licorice, cassia bark, Sichuan pepper, fennel and star anise. He also tenderises the meat before braising it for over an hour.\n“Initially, I was struggling to decide whether I should use these spices because the price was quite high. My mum asked, ‘Our profit margin is so thin, will you earn money?’” he recounts.\nBut he persisted, and business improved. Before the pandemic hit, his Oriental Stall — which he runs with his wife — sold 12 to 15 ducks a day. But sales are now down to two to three ducks a day.\nWhen filming took place during the Phase Two (Heightened Alert) from May 16 to June 13 — with no dining out allowed — he still had one and a half ducks left after lunchtime.\n“These last two years have been really bad,” Chow Gee says ruefully.\nDespite this, he does not want to retire. “The hawker centre is our first home. Our home is like a hotel. We go back to shower and sleep. When we wake up, we come down here, and we’re here the whole day, in this home,” he says.\n\n\n‘THE WORLD CAN’T COME’\nBefore the pandemic ground air travel to a halt, Maxwell Food Centre was popular with tourists. A former market, it was turned into a food centre in 1987 and housed many street hawkers who were originally from the China Street area.\nIf Singapore loses its heritage hawkers like those at Maxwell, it would lose a “big part” of its hawker culture, says food blogger Leslie Tay.\nSingapore’s hawker culture earned its Unesco Intangible Cultural Heritage listing last year, and “we wanted to show the world our hawker heritage”, he adds. “But now, the world can’t come.”\nHawkers in the central business district have suffered a bigger blow, with most office workers holed up at home.\nUnlike pricier restaurants, hawkers have found it harder to get on food delivery platforms, because the fee imposed would mean increasing their prices. Many hawkers want to keep their food affordable instead, says food blogger Seth Lui.\n“Some of these hawkers expressed to me that they feel bad having to increase the price of their food just to have it on the delivery platform,” he says. “They feel bad for the customers.”\nIt is hawker food fans like Tan Han Kee who are keeping some of their favourite stalls going. He has been buying from China Street Fritters for over 50 years — his grandfather and father were customers, as are his children.\nHe knows this familiar ritual would end if Kok Hua and his family retire. “It’s sad because all my childhood hawker stalls are going, one by one,” he says.\nRichard says that if there are no takers for the family recipe, the “worst-case scenario” is to record it for their descendants.\nA food critic had advised them to do this, saying, “Who knows (if) some day, somewhere, your third or fourth generation … would like to be involved in (the food and beverage business)? They can bring out this so-called treasured recipe to continue the legacy.”\nRichard himself joined the family business full-time in 2000 at his mother’s behest. Decades earlier when his father fell ill, he could not take over the business despite being the oldest son (and the third of 10 children) because he was under contract to an employer.\nAfter spending 30 years in the corporate world, his duties at China Street Fritters now include marketing and social media.\nWATCH: Hawkers in Maxwell Food Centre: Keeping the legacy alive (23:54)\nOriental Stall’s Chow Gee has also written down his recipe in a notebook in case his children want to use it in future.\nBut for now, the hawkers continue to labour hard each day. “I find that working as a hawker — long hours, humid environment, sacrificing family (and) friends — at the end of the day … is worth it,” says Kok Hua.\nWatch this episode of On The Red Dot here.

      The artisanal bakery in Bangkok with a sad past that few customers know of
  </h1>, 'text': 'At the Holey Mothership in Phra Khanong, Bangkok, customers swoon over tangy sourdough loaves and beautifully aerated, flaky croissants. Slow, Beautiful and Precise is the bakery’s motto, a tagline that reflects founder Nasirul Alam Porag’s insistence on strict quality control.\nIt was Porag’s Brazilian wife, Lilian Guerra, who planted the seed that gave birth to the Holey concept. Guerra and Porag, who is Bangladeshi-American, moved from New York to Dhaka in 2005 when he set up a natural pharmaceuticals business. The lack of decent bread in Dhaka led Porag to remedy the situation.\n\n\nA single-minded quest to make – as he calls it – ""the best bread in the world"" involved emailed consultations with global bread experts. This process finally led Porag to Maurice Chaplais, an internationally renowned artisan bakery consultant from the UK.\nChaplais had the experience of baking in Bangalore, India. That made him the perfect person to school Porag on the intricacies involved in nurturing perfect sourdough loaves, baguettes, croissants and other pastry products in a hot and humid environment.\n“He [Chaplais] came to Dhaka for three days. He brought some flour and a flask of yeast with him, and within hours we were making bread that was far superior to anything I had attempted before,"" Porag recalled.\nStill, multiple challenges remained. Chaplais had provided a list of the expensive Bongard equipment Porag would require to accomplish his mission. But getting it delivered to Dhaka was a process fraught with difficulty.\n“We had to have it delivered to Malaysia and then shipped to Dhaka,” explained Porag. “I’m very friendly with the people at Bongard now, but they just wouldn\'t believe that anybody was serious about using such advanced equipment in Bangladesh.”\nPorag and his business partner, Sadat Mehdi, achieved what many doubted was possible. Through a painstaking process of trial and error, they had introduced world-class bread and other bakery items to Bangladesh, a country where dhal traditionally takes precedence over sourdough.\n\n\nTo provide a showcase for their products, they created a gastronomic hub by the banks of Gulshan Lake in one of Dhaka’s most desirable residential areas, an enclave that is home to many foreign embassies.\nOpened in late 2014 in a villa overlooking the lake, Holey Artisan Bakery was beloved of expatriates and wealthy Bangladeshis alike.\nBut this gourmet utopia was shattered on the evening of Jul 1, 2016.\nPorag was at his new home in Bangkok when the call that would upend his life came through from Bangladesh. Mehdi was on the other end of the line, informing him of an armed siege on their Dhaka cafe.\n\n\n""It was surreal,"" recalled Porag. “We were in the process of opening our first bakery in Bangkok, so it was a busy period. I was at home with my family and friends visiting from New York when Sadat called to let me know what was unfolding in Dhaka.”\nWhen five militants stormed the restaurant just before 9pm, the venue was packed with customers dining and conversing at tables dotted around its interior and expansive grounds.\nThousands of kilometres away in the Thai capital, Porag was in near-constant communication with his partner.\n“I was the only one who had access to our internal camera with a partial view inside the bakery shop area, so I was watching what was going on throughout the siege,” he recalled.\nBy the time it was over, 29 people had died. A domestic terror group, Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen, was later blamed for the attack.\n“It was something we – perhaps naively – never saw coming,” reflected Porag. ""There\'s a tradition of warmth towards foreigners in Bangladesh so it was unexpected. In Gulshan, security is very tight. Therefore, the idea that anyone would have the audacity to conduct such an act is beyond the pale.”\nSuch a horrifying incident would have spelt the end for many businesses. It takes a tough constitution to compartmentalise tragedy and move forward. That Holey Artisan Bakery has managed to do so successfully reflects its high-level product and the strength of Porag’s resolve.\nPorag’s pursuit of perfection continues to this day. In Bangkok, there are currently three branches of Holey Artisan Bakery. And more are on the way. Porag is also eyeing a post-pandemic entry into the Japanese market, with a venue planned for Tokyo.\nHoley’s operation in Dhaka is also back up and running, albeit at a different Gulshan location. Nearly five years on from the attack, Holey Artisan Bakery is reasserting its credentials as a Bangladeshi success story.\nNevertheless, indelible scars remain.\n“When something like that happens, you try to remove yourself from the horror to an extent,” said Porag. ""I don\'t talk much about it. I try to remain positive, but I lost some great friends in the attack that day. I’ll carry that hurt forever.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     Bangkok ', '     Thailand ', '     Asia ', '     F&B ', '     food ', '     business ']}"

      'Fokus kami hanya kelangsungan hidup dari sehari ke sehari': Restoran lama KL guna simpanan sendiri harungi COVID-19
  </h1>, 'text': 'KUALA LUMPUR: Kawasan Petaling Street yang biasanya sibuk kini lengang dan sunyi sepi di bawah sekatan pergerakan penuh yang sedang berkuatkuasa.\nPeter Chin yang telah menguruskan Restoran Kiew Yee Baru di sini sejak 1960an berkata beliau\xa0mula menutup restoran pada jam 7.20 malam tanpa menunggu jam 8 malam seperti yang ditetapkan oleh kerajaan.\n“Lihatlah, langsung tiada apa pun yang berlaku,” ujar beliau sambil menuding ke arah Jalan Tun HS Lee.\n“Keadaan ini lebih sunyi daripada peristiwa 13 Mei,” kata Chin, merujuk kepada rusuhan kaum 1969 di Kuala Lumpur dan perintah berkurung bagi mematahkannya.\nWaktu restoran dibuka, menantu Chin, Chong Wan Heng, hanya memasang dapur sekali-sekala apabila ada pesanan masuk. Restoran yang beroperasi di premis kedai yang kelihatan sederhana ini menghidangkan masakan goreng seperti mi goreng Kantonis, tauhu daging cincang dan nasi goreng makanan laut.\n\n\nMalaysia mengenakan sekatan pergerakan di seluruh negara bermula 1 Jun untuk membendung kenaikan mendadak kes COVID-19. Makan di restoran tidak dibenarkan dan kedai hanya boleh beroperasi dari jam 8 pagi hingga 8 malam, manakala bekerja dari rumah menjadi aturan kerja utama untuk sektor bukan keperluan utama.\nHanya dua orang wakil isi rumah dibenarkan keluar membeli barang keperluan dan pergerakan dihadkan kepada 10km dari kediaman.\nSekatan pergerakan yang telah dilanjutkan sehingga 28 Jun ini merupakan pukulan yang hebat kepada golongan peniaga dan penjual. Kedai makan lama yang telah berpuluh tahun menghidangkan makanan tradisi antara yang teruk terjejas oleh sekatan pergerakan ini, memandangkan kebanyakannya belum lagi beralih kepada stail berniaga menerusi penghantaran.\nPengusaha kedai makan seperti ini tidak pasti berapa lama boleh terus beroperasi kerana mereka kini bergantung pada wang simpanan. Tumpuan mereka hanya untuk terus hidup dari sehari ke sehari.\n“Buat masa sekarang, saya tidak memikirkan langsung soal keuntungan. Selagi dapat pulang modal, tanggung kos bahan-bahan, gas, bil api-air dan gaji pekerja, saya bersyukur,” kata Chin.\n“Semasa muda, memang benar kami bimbang sama ada restoran kami akan gulung tikar. Tetapi kini kedai kami sudah cukup terkenal dan bersejarah. Kami boleh gunakan wang simpanan untuk mengharungi waktu sukar seperti ini.\n“Sekarang kami tiada masa untuk berfikir apa akan berlaku jika terpaksa menutup perniagaan. Fokus kami hanya untuk terus beroperasi dari sehari ke sehari,” ujar beliau.\nGUNA SIMPANAN SELAMATKAN PERNIAGAAN\nBagi Rosnah Husin yang menguruskan gerai\xa0Ikan Bakar Pak Din bersama suaminya Zainuddin Abdullah, kitaran sekatan pergerakan dan pembukaan semula selama setahun lepas telah mengurangkan simpanan perniagaan mereka.\nGerai ikan bakar yang dibuka pada 1997 ini merupakan kedai makan popular di kawasan Jalan Tanglin di tengah bandar raya Kuala Lumpur. Sebelum pandemik melanda, pelanggan datang berbondong-bondong. Malah, ada yang dari Kajang, Gombak dan Subang, kata Rosnah.\n""Kami terkesan teruk kerana had 10km. Orang-orang\xa0pun takut kena kompaun. Sebenarnya saya ada banyak pelanggan yang sudi datang dari jauh, bukan dari kawasan sekeliling saja,"" ujar beliau.\xa0\nSemasa zaman kegemilangannya, gerai\xa0ini menghabiskan sehingga 10 karung atau 100kg beras dari pagi hingga ke petang.\nKini, mereka hanya menggunakan dua karung beras, kata Rosnah. Pelanggan pula cuma datang untuk membeli ikan bakar dan nasi, tidak seperti dahulu di mana mereka boleh makan di situ dan memesan lebih banyak makanan.\n\n\nMenurut Rosnah, beliau dan suaminya tidak lagi mengambil gaji diri sendiri, sebaliknya menumpukan kepada kelangsungan perniagaan gerai mereka setiap minggu. Separuh daripada pekerja mereka telah berhenti atau diberhentikan. Yang selebihnya sanggup bekerja dengan potongan gaji 50 peratus.\n“Nasib baik kami ada simpan duit masa bisnes baik, jadi dapat guna masa PKP ini. Tapi makin panjang keadaan macam ini, lama-lama\xa0bukit pun jadi dataran,” ujar Rosnah.\xa0\nApabila CNA mengunjungi kedai mereka pada hari Rabu (16 Jun), pesanan makanan masuk pada kadar yang perlahan. Rosnah mengambil pesanan menerusi telefon dan suaminya atau para pekerja membungkus ikan bakar dengan kertas timah berserta nasi dan perencah seperti cili, bawang merah, sambal dan asam jawa.\n“Sama juga dengan jiran-jiran\xa0saya di warung ini. Kami semua pun nak terus hidup saja. Kini betul-betul\xa0hidup ibarat kais pagi makan pagi, kais petang makan petanglah,” ujar Rosnah.\nBegitu juga dengan Sathya Seelan Vijayakumar, pemilik Sri Ganapathi Mess di Petaling Jaya yang terpaksa menanggung sebahagian daripada kos niaga kedainya menggunakan wang simpanan kebelakangan ini.\nRestoran nasi daun pisang ini dibuka oleh bapanya sekitar 20 tahun lalu. Sotong goreng, rasam ketam dan parathal kambing merupakan antara makanan kegemaran pelanggannya.\nSri Ganapathi Mess terletak betul-betul bertentangan sebuah sekolah rendah. Jika dahulu, pada waktu makan tengah hari biasa, lalu lintas pasti sesak dengan pengunjung restoran dan ibu bapa yang berpusu-pusu mencari tempat letak kereta.\xa0\nKini, tempat ini sunyi sepi dan restoran pula kosong. Sekali-sekala apabila ada pesanan menerusi telefon atau dalam talian, para pekerja akan bingkas menyediakan makanan dan membungkusnya.\nMENYERTARI PLATFORM PENGHANTARAN\nDi kala banyak restoran dan kafe menyertai platform penghantaran seperti Grab dan Food Panda, sebahagian daripada kedai makan berusia puluhan tahun ini menahan daripada berbuat demikian atas beberapa sebab yang munasabah.\n“Pertama, saya tidak begitu mahir dengan teknologi baru,” kata Chin, pemilik Restoran Kiew Yee Baru.\n“Kedua, platform-platform ini mengambil komisen untuk setiap pesanan dan keuntungan tidak begitu besar untuk makanan asas, bermakna saya perlu menanggung kerugian atau menaikkan harga untuk menanggung kos buruh dan bahan-bahan,” tambah beliau.\nJika memilih untuk menaikkan harga, beliau berisiko kehilangan pelanggan.\n\n\nRosnah berkata perniagaan ikan bakar keluarganya baru sahaja berdaftar dengan sebuah platform penghantaran makanan utama dan sedang dalam proses mendapat kelulusan.\n“Saya pun dengar dari kawan-kawan\xa0tentang isu komisen. Untuk saya, saya kena jaga pelanggan-pelangan saya dulu. Lagipun, macam harga ikan pun tak tentu, ikut musim,” ujar beliau.\nKedua-dua perniagaan\xa0selama ini bergantung pada pesanan yang masuk menerusi panggilan telefon.\n“Setelah selesai memasak, kami akan menelefon pelanggan untuk memberitahu pesanan mereka sudah siap dan mereka boleh mengambilnya menggunakan servis penghantaran atau mengambilnya sendiri,” kata Chin.\nSri Ganapathi Mess milik Sathya Seelan pada awalnya tidak tersenarai di mana-mana platform penghantaran dalam talian, namun beliau mula menyedari keperluan ini setelah mengalami kerugian ketika sekatan pergerakan pada Mac tahun lalu.\n“Setelah 10 hari tanpa sebarang jualan, saya terpaksa menutup perniagaan selama sebulan, kemudian mendaftar dengan sebuah platform dan membuka semula perniagaan,” ujar beliau.\nBeliau mengakui jualan akan terjejas lebih teruk tanpa adanya platform penghantaran atau ambil sendiri tempahan. Semasa sekatan pergerakan kali ini, hasil jualan dalam talian dan bawa pulang telah membantu menanggung 70 hingga 80 peratus overhed perniagaan beliau.\n“Yang lebih penting lagi, kami boleh menjual kepada pelanggan yang tinggal di luar radius 10km atau had perjalanan rentas daerah semasa sekatan pergerakan penuh ini,” kata Sathya Seelan.\nRINDUKAN SUASANA\nPara pengusaha ini sayu melihat perniagaan mereka sunyi sepi semasa sekatan pergerakan.\nBagi Sathya Seelan, beliau paling merindui hiruk-pikuk berniaga.\n“Biasanya, waktu paling sibuk bagi kami adalah hujung minggu. Namun Sabtu lepas contohnya, jam 2 petang kami hanya berbual sesama sendiri kerana tidak banyak pesanan yang masuk.\n“Seorang daripada kami mencelah ‘Eh, selalunya kita akan sibuk ke sana ke mari menghidangkan nasi, sayur dan kari,’” jelas beliau.\n“Selain jualan, kami juga rindukan interaksi dengan pelanggan kerana kami ada beberapa orang pelanggan setia yang telah berkunjung semenjak kami memulakan perniagaan lagi, atau telah makan di sini selama lima, 10 tahun. Mereka kadangkala singgah dan minum secawan teh atau kopi,” ujar beliau.\xa0\nMembungkus nasi dan sayur dengan kotak kertas tidak menimbulkan keseronokan yang sama,\xa0kata beliau.\n“Tujuan utama orang datang ke restoran daun pisang adalah daun pisang itu. Kalau dimasukkan ke dalam kotak, apa beza kami dengan restoran nasi campur?” katanya sambil berseloroh.\nSesetengah pelanggan merindui perkara yang serupa sehinggakan ada yang meminta supaya kotak makanan mereka dialas\xa0daun pisang, kata Sathya Seelan lagi.\nBerdasarkan perkiraan beliau, Sathya Seelan berkata perniagaannya masih boleh berjalan dengan wang simpanan sehingga akhir Julai tanpa perlu memberhentikan mana-mana pekerjanya.\n“Namun menjelang Ogos, segalanya menjadi tanda tanya. Saya akan terpaksa membuat pertimbangan bagaimana untuk membolehkan perniagaan kami terus hidup,” ujar beliau.\xa0\nArtikel ini diterjemah dari\xa0Bahasa Inggeris.\nBaca juga artikel Bahasa Melayu\xa0ini tentang sekumpulan penunggang motosikal yang mencabar stereotaip bahawa wanita tidak mampu mengendalikan motosikal berkuasa tinggi.\nIkuti CNA di\xa0Facebook\xa0dan\xa0Twitter\xa0untuk lebih banyak artikel.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Malaysia ', '     COVID-19 ', '     lockdown ', '     restaurant ', '     food ']}"

      'We focus on getting through each day': Old KL eateries dig into savings while waiting out COVID-19 storm
  </h1>, 'text': 'KUALA LUMPUR: Petaling Street, a usually bustling area,\xa0was\xa0deserted and quiet under the current total lockdown.\xa0\nPeter Chin, who has been running\xa0Restoran Kiew Yee Baru in the same spot since the 1960s, said they would start closing the restaurant by 7.20pm on most nights and not\xa0even wait\xa0for the 8pm limit set by the government.\xa0\n“Take a look, there’s nothing going on,”\xa0he gestured down Jalan\xa0Tun HS\xa0Lee.\xa0\n“It’s even quieter than it was during May 13,” Chin said, referring to the 1969 race riots in Kuala Lumpur and the subsequent curfew to quell the incident.\xa0\nDuring the opening hours, Chin’s son-in-law Chong Wan Heng only fired up the stove\xa0whenever an order came\xa0in, which was few and far between. The restaurant, operating out of\xa0an unassuming shop lot, serves ""tze char"" dishes like\xa0Cantonese fried noodles, mincemeat tofu and\xa0seafood fried rice.\xa0\n\n\nMalaysia entered a nationwide lockdown from Jun 1 to contain the spike in COVID-19 cases. Dine-in at restaurants are prohibited and\xa0shops can only operate from 8am to 8pm, while work from home is the default arrangement for non-essential sectors.\xa0\nOnly two\xa0people per household are allowed to purchase essentials, with movement limited to a 10km radius from their residence.\xa0\nThe lockdown, which\xa0has since been\xa0extended until Jun 28,\xa0has dealt a serious blow to\xa0businesses and retailers. Time-honoured eateries that have been\xa0serving comforting, nostalgic dishes for decades are among those hit hard by the restrictions, especially when they have yet to jump on the delivery bandwagon.\xa0\nThey were unsure how long they could continue to operate as they are currently surviving on their savings, but their immediate focus is to take things one day at a time.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\n“Right now, I’m not even thinking about profits. As long as we can break even, cover the cost of our ingredients, our gas, the utilities and workers’ wages, I’m happy already,” Chin said.\n""When we were younger, yes we did worry that the restaurant might not survive.\xa0But we’re now an established eatery (lao zhao pai) and have such a long history, we can use our savings to help tide things over.\xa0\n""Right now, there’s not even time to entertain such thoughts about whether we might have to close or not, and we focus on getting through each day,"" he said.\xa0\nDIGGING INTO RESERVES TO STAY AFLOAT\nFor Rosnah Husin, who manages Pak Din Ikan Bakar with her husband\xa0Zainuddin Abdullah, the cycle of lockdowns and reopenings in over a year\xa0have\xa0depleted their businesses’ reserves.\xa0\nThe grilled fish stall, which was founded in 1997, is a popular establishment in central Kuala Lumpur’s Jalan Tanglin area. Before the pandemic, customers came in droves from areas as far as\xa0Kajang, Gombak and Subang, Rosnah said.\n“The 10km travel limit and people’s fear of being fined have really badly affected us. Because a lot of customers and our regulars don’t just come from the surrounding area,"" she said.\xa0\nIn its heyday, the stall used up to 10 sacks or 100kg of rice from morning until late afternoon.\xa0\nThese days, they only use two bags of rice, Rosnah said. Customers also just came to buy\xa0grilled fish and\xa0rice, unlike when they were able to dine in and order more food.\n\n\nRosnah said she and her husband have stopped paying themselves salaries, and were just focused on ensuring the stall\'s survival each week. Half of their workers had left or were let go; the remaining ones were willing to work at half their usual pay.\xa0\n“Luckily we always put money away for reserves, but as\xa0this current lockdown drags on, even the hill has become flat,” Rosnah said, playing on a traditional Malay proverb about slowly accumulating wealth.\xa0\nWhen CNA visited their stall on Wednesday (Jun 16), orders were only trickling\xa0in slowly. Rosnah was taking orders on the phone and\xa0her husband or the workers would wrap the\xa0grilled fishes in tin foil and pack\xa0them with rice and condiments made of chilli, shallots, sauce and tamarind.\xa0\n“It is the same with my neighbours here. We’re all just trying to survive, it’s literally surviving on what we can scratch out in the morning,”\xa0Rosnah said.\n\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bLikewise,\xa0Sathya Seelan Vijayakumar, the current proprietor of Sri Ganapathi Mess in Petaling Jaya, said he has to cover\xa0part of the outlet\'s overheads from its reserves these days.\xa0\nThe\xa0banana leaf rice restaurant was started by his father some 20 years ago. Fried squid, crab rasam and mutton parathal were among the well-loved dishes.\xa0\nSri Ganapathi Mess is situated\xa0right opposite a primary school, and had it been a normal lunch hour, traffic would\xa0often be a snarl as diners and parents jostle for parking space.\nNow, the area was quiet and the eatery was empty. An occasional call or online order would prompt the workers to prepare and pack.\nSIGNING UP WITH DELIVERY PLATFORMS\xa0\nWhile\xa0many restaurants and cafes have\xa0signed\xa0up with delivery platforms such as Grab and Food Panda, some of these decade-old eateries said they were resisting\xa0the idea\xa0for practical reasons.\xa0\n“One, I’m not very conversant with new technology,” said\xa0Restoran Kiew Yee Baru\'s Chin.\xa0\n“Two, the platforms take commissions for every order, and the profit isn’t very big for the basic dishes, so either I take the loss, or I have to raise prices to cover the costs of labour and ingredients,” he added.\xa0\nBut if he were to raise prices, he would be in danger of losing his customers.\nRosnah\xa0said her family’s grilled fish stall had only just signed up with a major food delivery platform and was going through the approval process.\xa0\n“But I had heard from my other friends in the food business about the commission structure, and for me, my primary concern is I have to take care of my customers first. Items like fish are also seasonal and the prices are not fixed,” she said.\xa0\nBoth establishments have been relying on orders that came in through phone calls.\xa0\n“Once we’re done with cooking, we call the customer to let them know their order is ready and they can arrange either for a delivery rider, or come themselves to pick it up,” Chin said.\xa0\n\n\nSathya Seelan\'s Sri Ganapathi Mess was initially not on any online delivery platform but he saw the need after suffering bad business during last year\'s\xa0lockdown in March.\xa0\n“After 10 days with no business, I had to shut everything down for a month, register ourselves on the platform, and then reopen for business,” he said.\nHe acknowledged that business would be much worse without the delivery platforms and takeaways. In this current lockdown,\xa0electronic orders and takeaways helped cover 70 to 80 per cent of their overheads.\xa0\n“More importantly, we can reach our customers who live beyond the 10km or inter-district travel limits during this total lockdown,” Sathya Seelan said.\xa0\nMISSING THE ATMOSPHERE\nIt has not been easy seeing their establishments stay quiet during the lockdown.\xa0\xa0\nFor Sathya Seelan, the thing he missed the most\xa0was the atmosphere.\n“Usually, our busiest times are the weekend. But last Saturday for instance, it was 2pm and we talked\xa0among ourselves because not many orders were coming in.\n“And we were remarking that ‘Hey, usually we would be busy running around the place serving rice, vegetable and curries,’” he described.\xa0\n“Sales aside, we also miss the interaction with our customers because we have some really long-time regulars, who have been coming here since we started business, or have been dining in for five, 10 years.\xa0They sometimes stop and linger over a cup of tea or coffee,” he said.\xa0\nPacking rice and vegetables into paper boxes was just not the same, he said.\xa0\n“The whole point of banana leaf rice\xa0is the banana leaf. Packing our food into boxes makes us like nasi campur (mixed rice),” he laughed.\nApparently, some customers also miss the experience so much that they made a special request to have their takeout boxes lined with banana leaves, Sathya Seelan said.\xa0\nBy his own calculations, Sathya Seelan said, the business could run on its reserves until\xa0the end of July, without having to let go of any of its workers.\n“But by August, it becomes a question mark, and then I have to see how we are able to keep this business running,” he said.\xa0\nRead this story in Bahasa Melayu here.\xa0\n\n\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     Malaysia ', '     COVID-19 ', '     lockdown ', '     restaurant ', '     food ']}"

      The real deal on air-frying: Is it that much healthier than deep-frying food?
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Can you have fried food without feeling guilty, knowing that it is unhealthy?\nThis is what manufacturers of air fryers promise — great-tasting food with minimal fat. Some even claim a fat reduction of up to 90 per cent as air-frying does not require oil.\nAnd people are buying into it. The global air fryer market is expected to reach US$1.18 billion (S$1.56 billion) in size by 2026, up from US$680 million in 2019, according to brand and consulting firm KBV Research.\nAir-frying involves creating and circulating hot air to “quickly cook the surface layer” of food and “quickly dry it out” for that fried, crunchy texture, noted food scientist Zhou Weibiao.\nAdding just a “touch” of oil can “bring the air-fried food closer to the deep-fried one” — minus the calories — said the professor, who heads the National University of Singapore’s Department of Food Science and Technology.\nBut caloric intake aside, how much healthier is air-fried food?\nTo find out, the programme Talking Point selected three everyday foods: Chicken wings, selar kuning (yellow-banded scad, the fish that often accompanies nasi lemak) and French fries.\nOne set was air-fried, the other was deep-fried, and both sets were tested for saturated fats, trans fats and cholesterol.\nThe laboratory test results showed that the air-fried chicken wings had 38 per cent less saturated fats than the deep-fried version, while the air-fried selar kuning and chips had about 53 per cent less saturated fats.\nThe air-fried chicken wings also had 55 per cent less trans fats and 25 per cent less cholesterol than the deep-fried version.\n\n\nThere was little to no difference, however, in trans fat levels between the air-fried and deep-fried versions of selar kuning and French fries.\nNutritionist Carolyn Stephen of Singapore Polytechnic’s Food Innovation and Resource Centre attributed this to the fact that the fish and potatoes had little trans fat in the first place.\nAs for cholesterol levels, there was only a 1 per cent difference between the two versions of selar kuning. Fish is naturally low in cholesterol, she noted, while potatoes “don’t have cholesterol because it’s a plant-based food”.\nTHE ACRYLAMIDE TEST\nThe chips were also tested for acrylamide, a chemical that forms when certain types of starchy foods, such as potatoes and bread, are cooked at high temperatures. That includes the frying process.\nResearch has suggested that acrylamide in food has the potential to cause cancer. And in February, tests carried out by the Hong Kong Consumer Council found acrylamide in the chips fried in various models of air fryers.\nThe levels ranged between 102 micrograms (μg) per kilo and 7,038 μg/kg, with samples from six of the 12 air fryer models containing acrylamide that exceeded the European Union benchmark of 500 μg/kg.\nFor\xa0the Talking Point samples, the test results showed a huge spike in acrylamide: The deep-fried potatoes contained less than 10 μg/kg, but the air-fried ones contained 1,400 μg/kg.\nWATCH: Can air fryers cause cancer? 3 ways to reduce this risk (2:50)\nStephen said she understands if this “raises some concern”. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has described acrylamide as a health concern, although she noted the caveat that the evidence on “what’s safe and what’s not safe” in humans is “lacking”.\n“A lot of studies that have been done in the area of acrylamide have been based on lab animals,” she said.\nThe WHO has called for more long-term studies of acrylamide levels in food and the risk exposure. Accordingly, Singapore has not yet established a regulatory benchmark for acrylamide intake, she noted.\nOn its website, the Singapore Food Agency states that the information available so far “reinforces general advice on healthy eating, including moderating consumption of fried and fatty foods”.\nTo reduce the build-up of acrylamide, Philips Asean Pacific personal health leader Nicholas Lee said consumers should also take note of three factors: Cooking time (not too long), cooking temperature and preparation.\nTalking Point host Sharda Harrison had air-fried her potatoes for 14 minutes at 200 degrees Celsius, while the deep-fried version was on medium to high heat for eight minutes. Lee, however, recommended cooking them at 180° Celsius “or slightly below”.\n“If you’re cooking fresh potatoes, 160 (degrees) for the first part and then 180 (degrees) for the second part … would reduce the quantity of acrylamide that forms,” he said.\nAs for the preparation, soaking potatoes before frying them was one of his tips. “That’ll remove a lot of the starch and … sugar content (which) influence the formation of acrylamide,” he said. “It actually makes the fries taste better.”\nHe advised against storing potatoes in the fridge at very low temperatures, which would increase the sugar content and therefore the amount of acrylamide.\nConsumers can also avoid overcooking by sticking to “that golden brown texture that you’re looking for in beautiful, home-made fries”, he added. Darker crusts indicate higher acrylamide levels.\nAIR-FRIED HAWKER FOOD?\nAs a cooking option at home, air-frying may be increasing in popularity — one brand in Singapore saw air fryer sales grow by 50 per cent between 2019 and last year — but eating out is a different matter.\nIndustrial-grade air fryers are not readily available, nor are Singapore’s hawkers putting air-fried dishes on the menu.\nIt is not for lack of demand — a 2017 Nielsen online survey showed that 74 per cent of Singaporean respondents were willing to pay more for foods that promote health benefits.\nNot all foods, however, are suitable for air-frying, said blogger Erinna Chng, who was previously hired by a leading brand to try out air fryer-friendly recipes.\nDishes fried in batter, such as Indian rojak and banana fritters, would “create a mess in the air fryer” as it does not have the oil to “set the batter”.\n“I think western (food) stalls that mainly use frozen pre-fried food would be suitable for (air-frying); for example, if they cook the fries in the air fryer, it would help to drain the oil,” she added.\n“Air fryers actually work for stalls that don’t totally depend on frying. For example, nasi lemak stalls (could) air-fry their chicken wings and fish. The wonton noodle (stalls) can pre-cook their fried wontons beforehand and … reheat using the air fryer.”\nTo put theory to the test, Kong Chee Chiew, assistant general manager of Fatty Bom Bom’s chain of western food stalls, agreed to offer air-fried versions of three side dishes.\nUsing three air fryers with the biggest capacity Talking Point could find, his team air-fried roasted wing sticks, Cajun wings and Cajun onion rings for lunch.\nAt the end of the one-hour experiment, most of the diners who tried the items enjoyed the taste and said they would love the air-fried dishes to be permanent options on the menu.\nKong does not think it is possible, however, to completely switch from deep-fried to air-fried meals one day. “Customers normally don’t want to wait too long (at) lunchtime,” he said. “(The air fryer) is slow … (and) too small.”\nWATCH: The full episode — is air-fried food really healthier? (22:05)\nBut he would consider air-frying if bigger, industrial-size air fryers that can handle a high volume of orders were available.\nUntil then, said Harrison, citing the health benefits, “I’ll just have to air-fry at home when I’m craving for something deep-fried”.\nWatch this episode of Talking Point here.

      Nasi lemak buah keluak and mee siam rosti? You can enjoy them at the Raffles
  </h1>, 'text': 'There are no shortage of dining options in Singapore, but the most popular venues require quite a bit of planning to secure a reservation.\nTake Peranakan private dining chef Annette Tan’s FatFuku outfit, for instance. Her thrice-weekly dinners are technically fully booked until the end of the year. Or, as she described over the phone, she’s working her way down her waiting list, “which could take until the end of the year”. Right now she’s filling slots with diners who booked in October 2020.\n\n\nFor those lacking saintly patience, there’s an easier way to sample some of Tan’s specialities. From May 12 to Jun 11, she has teamed up with Raffles Courtyard to present a scaled-down version of what she typically serves at home, packaged for the setting. A FatFuku pop-up, if you will.\nFrom 3pm to 9pm daily during the monthlong collaboration, foodies can savour Tan’s signature items like the aforementioned nasi lemak buah keluak and mee siam rosti, as well as pandan kueh koh swee and roasted banana ice cream with gula melaka syrup – amid palm trees and elegant wrought-iron pavilions in the terracotta-tiled patio setting.\nThe collaboration is the second in a series that sees Raffles Courtyard teaming up with Singapore’s private dining luminaries; the first, with PasirPanjangBoy (aka Tinoq Russel Goh and Dylan Chan), was held from Mar 12 to Apr 11. Tan herself is no stranger to collaborative efforts, having worked in the kitchens of Nouri during the Circuit Breaker and Roketto Izakaya last September, among others.\nOn Wednesdays and Thursdays from 6pm to 8pm, Tan will be present to meet diners. Of her specially curated menu for Raffles Courtyard, she said: “In my house, I serve a big communal dinner. Raffles Courtyard intrinsically serves a menu of bar food – easy to eat dishes that go well with drinks. This menu that I’ve created is themed that way. The nasi lemak is individually portioned. The mee siam is snack-sized. The prices are also accessible – S$39 for the entire bundle.”\nDiners have a choice of ordering the dishes a la carte, or in a bundle that includes all four. They can also pair them with drinks (priced separately) from Raffles Courtyard’s bar menu.\nAt a media preview in April, we were delighted by the combination of nasi lemak and buah keluak in a single dish. On a bed of fragrant nasi lemak, Tan heaped a generous helping of buah keluak – a mixture of the fruit, minced prawns and pork – the dish served in a banana leaf package with a side of crisp, tangy achar (pickles). That the buah keluak was served out of its shell and ready-to-eat was a bonus for us.\nWe found the mee siam rosti to be a clever take on the local favourite. There was no mee involved – in its place, potato pancakes, topped with two plump prawns and quail eggs, then lashed with sambal. Very addictive.\nAlso potentially habit-forming was the pandan kueh koh swee: Soft, starchy squares infused with the aroma and flavour of pandan juice and coconut. Much less cloying than some versions you get elsewhere.\nRounding off our meal was the roasted banana ice cream with gula melaka syrup, made from caramelised bananas roasted with pure cane sugar, which gave the dessert a flavour reminiscent of pisang goreng (fried banana fritters). For such a small spread of bite-sized treats, we were surprisingly sated.\nRaffles Courtyard x FatFuku runs from May 12 to Jun 11, 3pm to 9pm daily.

      Wagyu prices have gone up in Singapore, but that hasn’t dented demand
  </h1>, 'text': ""When Singaporeans can’t travel to Japan to get their wagyu fix, they’ll go all out to savour it here in as many forms as they can. And buoyed by the demand, especially in the past year, restaurants have been rolling out new wagyu omakase menus and introducing new varieties of the marbled Japanese beef coveted for its divinely tender and umami flavour.\nThe Gyu Bar recently added a nine-course, wagyu-focused omakase menu (S$238++ per person) featuring breeds from seven different Japanese prefectures including Furano and Kagoshima, eaten in different ways such as shabu shabu (hotpot), yakiniku (grilled) and as a steak katsu with homemade curry.\n\n\nAt Bedrock Bar and Grill's first edition of its annual World Meat Series early this year, it featured Yamaguchi wagyu from Jukuho Farm. While beef is usually aged hung or placed on a rack to dry for several weeks, Yamaguchi’s “ageing” process refers to the cattle rearing period of 100 months instead of the usual 26 to 28 months. This increases the wagyu’s unsaturated fatty acids and amino acid, which render it much richer in flavour.\nChef Isaac Tan, head of culinary and product innovations at Commonwealth Concepts, which owns and operates Bedrock, said: “Over the years, consumers have become more well-travelled, and their palate and spending power have also changed. They now seek to experience the rarest and the best. Wagyu is considered the most superior beef variety, so we have definitely seen a significant increase in wagyu consumption compared to the past.”\nVadim Korob, managing director of Zafferano Italian Restaurant & Lounge shared that the restaurant introduced Japanese A4 Kagoshima wagyu and Australian Jac and Sher wagyu earlier this year.\n“Ever since we changed the a la carte beef option from Black Angus to wagyu, we have noticed significantly more guests selecting beef as their main course,” he explained, adding that due to the increase in demand, the restaurant has started to purchase wagyu in larger quantities, “hence our suppliers are offering better prices at more competitive rates”.\nOther popular wagyu dishes include the Wagyu Beef Tenderloin Tartare (S$28++) and the grilled A4 Kagoshima wagyu beef striploin (S$148++ for 160g).\nDuring the Circuit Breaker, eight out of the top ten bestsellers at Fat Cow were wagyu-focused items, such as The Fat Cow Donburi (S$48++), the Fat Foa-Gura Don (S$48++), and the 21 Days Dry-Aged Nagasaki A5 Wagyu Premium Donburi (S$138++).\nTo cater to customers who are becoming more educated in the different types of wagyu and who are interested in trying out variations, it launched a new wagyu omakase menu last August.\nThe restaurant’s\xa0 spokesperson said: “The number of guests dining on the wagyu omakase have steadily increased each month. Based on the current trajectory, we expect this to continue.” It currently has wagyu from more than seven Japanese prefectures such as Hyogo (Kobe beef) and Hida.\n“Over the years, consumers have become more well-travelled, and their palate and spending power have also changed. They now seek to experience the rarest and the best.” – Isaac Tan\n\n\nRISING PRICES\nKaren Cheng, co-founder of The Gyu Bar, shared that while wagyu prices have increased, the difference varies depending on the brand and prefecture, as well as the “limited supply and growing demand, and external circumstances like currency fluctuation and the recent pandemic”. Other restaurants have also cited rising labour and freight costs as factors in the increased prices.\nCheng shared: “Since The Gyu Bar opened in 2018, we have noticed an up to 20 per cent increase in price in the last two to three years for some brands, and up to 5 per cent for others within the same period. We have adjusted and increased the variety of our menu offerings instead of increasing prices. This lets diners appreciate a wider selection of wagyu across different preparation methods.”\nAcross the industry, Cheng has observed more Japanese wagyu-focused restaurants popping up to cater to increasing consumer demand. “Traditionally, Japanese wagyu was featured more often in Japanese restaurants. Now, more premium and fine dining restaurants are offering quality Japanese wagyu across both Western and Asian cuisines such as Italian and Chinese.”\nAt The Gyu Bar, “newcomers” such as the Kumamoto and olive-fed Sanuki wagyu from Kagawa (Japan’s smallest prefecture, which only started producing wagyu in the 2000s and is renowned for its olive groves) strut alongside household names such as Kobe, Miyazaki and the Oh Mi wagyu from Shiba, the\xa0production of which dates back to over four centuries ago.\n“We have noticed an up to 20 per cent increase in price in the last two to three years for some brands, and up to 5 per cent for others within the same period.” – Karen Cheng\n\n\nCheng said: “Over the past two to three years, Kumamoto wagyu has been gaining popularity for its buttery milky flavours, as well as its affordability. Our customers also enjoy the olive beef for its marbling, texture, and balanced flavours that stem from its special diet that includes pressed olives. We serve Sanuki olive beef sirloin as yaki-shabu, a signature at the restaurant that pairs sliced beef grilled yakiniku-style with egg yolk, sukiyaki sauce, and truffle shavings.”\nShangri-La Hotel’s Origin Grill also recently introduced an olive-fed wagyu from Hata Farm in Kagawa (S$218++ for a 250g A4 ribeye). Cows munching on the olives produce beef with exceptionally high levels of oleic acid and a rich and buttery mouthfeel. The restaurant also has rare and exclusive cuts such as a 500-day, Japanese diet-fed Shiro Kin Wagyu and snow-aged wagyu from Niigata (S$168++ for a 200g striploin).\nA spokesperson from Origin Grill said that demand for wagyu has increased by 20 to 30 per cent over the years. The restaurant serves grass-, corn- and grain-fed pure, crossbred and full-blooded Angus and wagyu cattle from Australia and Japan. Its Origin Beef Platter for two is especially popular with guests as they can enjoy four different types of beef and wagyu.\n“While the prices of wagyu have not decreased, the price range has certainly widened to include more accessible products. As the number of wagyu producers increase, there are more affordable types of wagyu sourced from crossbred cattle farms. These are not pure-bred wagyu, but cattle mixed with other bloodlines. Full-blood wagyu usually come with a higher price point.”\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Singapore ', '     food ', '     Restaurants ', '     F&B ', '     gastronomy ', '     Fine dining ']}"

      From Wall Street to seafood shack: Who’s the Luke behind Luke’s Lobster? 
  </h1>, 'text': 'As a big seafood (and of course, lobster) fan, imagine my delight when the famed Luke’s Lobster opened its first outlet here in Singapore in September last year. When I finally sunk my teeth into a lobster roll, I couldn’t help but crave for more.\nWell, we’re now almost midway through 2021, and I may or may not have gone back to Luke’s a couple more times. I’m probably not the only one either, as owing to popular demand, Luke’s has since opened its second outlet\xa0at\xa0Jewel Changi Airport.\n\n\nJuicy, succulent lobster rolls aside, it is 7.30pm here in Singapore, and I’m scheduled to get on a Zoom call with Luke Holden, founder of Luke’s Lobster. And yes, he named the business after himself.\nHolden dials into the call a little after 7.30pm. It’s 7.30 am in the morning where he is based in South Portland, Maine, but he’s already at his work desk. He apologises for the wait. He spent the morning making smoothies with his two little daughters, “and we made a mess, so we were running a bit late,” he said.\nHolden calls himself a “third-generation lobsterman”. For the uninitiated, a “lobsterman” is a fisherman who catches lobsters.\n“My father was a lobsterman-turned-lobster dealer. Eventually, he opened the first licensed lobster processor here in the state of Maine 40 to 45 years ago,” Holden shared.\nThe 37-year-old spent his childhood “growing up on the back of boats”. In his youth, he worked at his dad’s production facility. Even through high school and college, Holden kept on lobstering.\n“In my second year of studying business at Georgetown University in Washington, DC, my parents basically told me that if I was going to continue lobstering, they were not going to support my education. If I wanted to keep doing it, they’d teach me what I needed to know. I wouldn’t need to go to college for four years and rack up all this debt,” Holden said.\nEventually, Holden took up an internship working at an investment bank. “That was fine, I was good at it, and I liked the people I worked with,” he said.\nIn his junior year, Holden ended up accepting a full time position as a financial analyst in an investment bank in New York, so he packed his bags and moved to the Big Apple. “It was rewarding. I got to work with smart people, solve big problems and make some money. But there was no passion behind it,” he admitted.\nOne afternoon, seated at his work desk, Holden started feeling a little homesick. He decided to search for something that reminded him of Maine. “That was a lobster roll, but there was really no affordable high quality lobster rolls in New York at the time. So I wrote a business plan and decided to team up with my dad.”\nAt the time, Holden’s dad was still running one of the largest lobster production facilities in Maine. Together with business partner Ben Conniff, the pair “bought all our seafood from him and opened up a tiny little shack in the East Village in 2009. It was extremely popular and so much fun.”\n\n\nA LABOUR OF LOVE\nIn the early days of Luke’s Lobster, Holden was running the business while still holding his job at the investment bank. “I was working 70 to 80 hours a week, and sleeping a couple of hours a night,” said Holden.\nHolden would wake up early to help set up the restaurant in the morning before clocking in to his day job. As soon as work was done, he would head back to the restaurant to “help clean up, count the jar, manage inventory, and get set for the next day”.\nIt must have been exhausting, I offered. But Holden shrugged it off. “It was just so energising,” he quipped. “It really helped that I was 25 years old. You have a lot of energy at that age.”\nAside from having youth on his side, it did help that Holden didn’t have any other commitments either. “This was my focus, I had no distractions. I had an apartment lease, a gym membership, and a running bar tab. That was about it for responsibilities. It was an interesting time to be all in and entirely consumed with Luke’s.”\nSo what was the push that made him eventually leave Wall Street? “Well, I wanted to go from a cushy job with a high salary and benefits to a job that only paid me US$30,000 a year with no healthcare. In a startup business, where 80 per cent of restaurants fail in the first two years,” he joked. “But honestly, I was just passionate about the business. I’ve always loved the lobster industry.”\n""I was just passionate about the business. I’ve always loved the lobster industry.”\nBRIGHT SPOTS IN A PANDEMIC\nFast forward to today, and Luke’s Lobster has expanded all over the US with restaurants in Boston, Chicago, New York, Philadelphia, Washington, DC, Miami, San Francisco and Las Vegas. Its first international outpost opened in Japan in 2015.\nWhat’s lesser known about Luke’s, however, is that the company is one of the US’ largest supplier of lobster products. Not only does it supply seafood to its shacks around the world, it also supplies frozen lobster products sold in supermarkets such as Whole Foods.\nAt the time of our chat, Holden revealed\xa0that it had\xa0been a “trying year” for the company, what with the pandemic. In the US, all but its flagship shack in Portland was shuttered, and the company had to furlough 90 per cent of the team. “It was gut-wrenching,” he said.\nNonetheless, there have been some bright spots for the business. For one, Luke’s Lobster made a pivot to e-commerce, selling seafood products such as lobster, crab, bluefin tuna, scallops and more on its online marketplace. “We stood that thing up in a matter of days,” Holden shared. The e-commerce business has now become a sustainable revenue stream for the company.\nThen there is, of course, the company’s expansion into Singapore, its first Southeast Asian foray. The first Luke’s Lobster outlet in Singapore was a long time coming, said Holden. The company’s shacks in Japan, famous for their long queues, had built pent-up demand among\xa0Singaporeans. “We had close to 300 enquiries from Singaporeans asking to license Luke’s.”\nEventually, the company decided to partner with Vijay Pillai, CEO of Caerus Holding, to franchise the business in Singapore. Holden describes initiating what he called a “dating process” with Pillai.\xa0\n“We started \'dating\' Pillai almost four years ago. We brought him to New York and had him work in some of our shacks. I had him stay with my family in South Portland, I took him out on my boat. It’s really important to understand who we\'re partnering with, both on a personal and professional level.”\n\n\nMuch to his regret, Holden could not be present in Singapore when the first outlet opened at Shaw House, nor the second at Jewel Changi Airport. Nonetheless, Holden said that “sales are going very well”, and he can’t wait to fly down here to “spend some time in the shacks and with the team”.\n\n\nA post shared by Luke’s Lobster Singapore (@lukeslobstersg)\nA spokesperson from Caerus Holding\xa0shared that “compared to the US, the food culture here in Singapore is fast-paced as consumers are always seeking new experiences and flavours”.\nTo that end, Luke\'s Lobster Singapore\xa0has launched several seasonal rolls to excite local fans. At the start of the year, it introduced a Truffle Butter Lobster Roll. Available from April to May is the Hot Honey Lobster Roll – a spiced-honey version of the signature roll aimed at spice-loving locals.\nWe locals really love our unique flavours, like our beloved chilli crab, I shared. “Yes, and what we would love to do is take these recipes that work very well in Singapore, and then share\xa0them in our domestic shacks in New York, Boston, Chicago, DC and more. We set up the franchise in a way that allows us to share limited time offers across borders,” Holden responded.\nDoes that mean we’ll see a chilli crab lobster roll in New York in the future? “I hope so!” Holden quipped.\n""What we would love to do is take these recipes that work very well in Singapore, and then share\xa0them in our domestic shacks in New York, Boston, Chicago, DC and more.""\xa0\n\n\nLIFE OUTSIDE LUKE’S\nThough Holden said that recovery for Luke’s restaurant business in the US has been slow, he remains hopeful. “There\'s momentum on our side and things are steadily improving every week.”\nWhen he’s not busy running one of the world’s most beloved lobster restaurants, however, the proud dad enjoys spending time with his family. “But I also love spending time at our restaurant, so this past weekend, I brought my two little rugrats there and we had a wonderful time,” he said, sharing a video of his three-year-old bravely touching one of the restaurant’s live lobsters through the computer screen. \xa0\nHis girls are big fans of Luke’s lobster rolls as well. “But I’ll be honest and say that my oldest prefers the lobster bisque the most,” shared Holden.\nHolden is also an avid ice hockey player, and plays in what he calls an “old man’s league” that gathers around 10pm at night for a game. “We have a beer and play hockey. It’s not that competitive. It’s about having fun and getting a sweat in.”\nAnd if you’re curious to know what his favourite item on the Luke’s Lobster menu is, Holden says that his go-to is always the classic lobster roll.\nOutside of the Luke’s Lobster menu, however, his favourite food is baked haddock. “A baked haddock platter is just so, so good,” the avid seafood lover chirped.\n', 'related_topics': ['     dining ', '     food ', '     Singapore ', '     F&B ', '     Profiles ']}"

      All your favourite restaurants fully booked? Here’s how to snag a reservation
  </h1>, 'text': 'It’s a late Friday afternoon. Your body has had enough of the week-long grind and your brain is done too. You’ve worked in excess of 45 hours, taken three too many Zoom calls, and spent too much time explaining something so straightforward you can’t believe your manager doesn’t understand it.\nYou’re ready for an early drink and dinner at that restaurant everyone’s talking about. But you’re late. Every restaurant you call is booked solid. You could now brave the hawker centre and humidity, or arrange a McDelivery while you slink home in lonely surrender.\n\n\nYou would have had better luck if you had\xa0planned ahead, of course. And by planning ahead, we mean sitting by your computer or tablet, fingers poised to book a coveted reservation at exactly 10am, at least two months ahead on the first of the month (that’s the only way to score a spot at popular modern Singaporean restaurant Mustard Seed, by the way).\xa0 \xa0\n\n\nA post shared by Mustard Seed (@mustardseed_sg)\nRestaurants, if you haven’t already heard, are the happy beneficiaries of the travel dollars that Singaporeans haven’t been able to spend. And it certainly seems like the more expensive the establishment, the less available it is.\nTake Burnt Ends, where the pleasure of sitting by an open kitchen in front of coal grills emanating thick waves of warmth will set you back upwards of S$230 at dinner. Reservations are released 30 days in advance and are snapped up faster than Lil Nas X’s unofficial “Satan” Nikes.\nJapanese restaurant Shoukouwa, which has prices starting from S$320 for lunch to S$480 for dinner, is more or less booked solid for the next two months as well. While customers can try to book on its website’s reservation page, Edina Hong of the Emmanuel Stroobant Group, which owns the restaurant, said it’s easier to call and ask when they can be slotted in.\n“They can also leave their name and we will call them when there is a cancellation, which happens sometimes a week or so in advance,” she added. “Very often, people come in for a meal and then book their next reservation before they leave. We only have eight seats so reservations fill up quick.”\n\n\nLOOK UP, KEEP UP\nPaying attention to time and social media serves the eager diner well. Many restaurants have booking systems where reservations open 30 to 60 days in advance at specific times.\nUpscale kappo restaurant Kisho, for instance, opens reservations at 10am on the first day of each month, while Odette – voted number two in Asia’s Best Restaurants 2021 – accepts bookings 60 days in advance. Wildly popular Japanese restaurant Esora releases reservations at 12pm on the 1st and 15th of every month, two months ahead.\nOnce aware of these schedules, all that’s left to do is set your alarm and keep your browser poised at the exact time. Then it’s that old-fashioned game of fastest fingers first.\n“Our seats are usually fully booked from the moment slots open,” said a spokesperson for Odette and Esora, which are both under the stable of The Lo & Behold Group.\n\n\n“We feel incredibly humbled and grateful for the support every time this happens. As much as possible, we try to accommodate all enquiries. If guests have difficulty making a reservation, we always encourage them to drop us an email where we can offer alternative dates or times to accommodate their schedule. Alternatively, we will invite them to be placed on the waitlist to be contacted promptly should a table become available.”\nSocial media is another means of keeping an eye out for available reservations. Establishments like Appetite, Mustard Seed and The Orientalist House use the likes of Instagram to broadcast the release of new reservation dates or last-minute cancellations that the public can snap up.\nA less painstaking way of snagging a booking is settling for an off-hour reservation at say 2.30pm, 5.30pm or 9.30pm – if you’re not famished by that time. Alternatively, lunch bookings at fine restaurants like Odette can be easier to come by since there are the odd one or two available tables (or seats in the case of larger Japanese restaurants like Hashida Singapore) earlier in the week.\nBecause restaurants are configured in their own unique ways, sometimes changing the number of people in your party gives you a better chance of scoring a table.\nWhen we tried booking a table for two at Mexican restaurant Nixta some months ago, the reservation system showed no availability for the next couple of months. However, when we changed the request to a table for four, several options appeared.\nAnd then there’s the old-fashioned strategy of calling in favours or booking your next reservation as soon as you’ve finished your meal at the restaurant. It is much easier for restaurant staff to find you a spot when you’re personally picking out dates with them.\nFinally, it always, always pays to be a gracious guest. If you show appreciation for the food and service, and perhaps even tip well, restaurants would be far more willing to bend backwards to have you back time and again.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Singapore ', '     Restaurants ', '     Chefs ', '     food ', '     F&B ', '     Fine dining ']}"

      Jackfruit 'ngoh hiang' and soy ‘kalbi’: Singapore restaurants serving alternative meats
  </h1>, 'text': ""People choose to eat less meat – or not at all – for many reasons. But no matter where your beliefs lie, one thing is for sure. With a growing consumer demand for alternative or plant-based meats as more people seek to minimise animal suffering and mitigate global warming, we are likely to see an increasing number of alt-meat options showing up on the menus of our favourite restaurants in time to come.\nFor instance, when American company Eat Just’s Good Meat Cultured Chicken was launched in Singapore earlier this year, private member’s club 1880 scored a coup by being the first restaurant to offer the lab-grown meat on its menu.\nThe novelty factor certainly attracted attention but by most accounts, most diners not only said the cultured chicken tasted as good as, or better than, conventional chicken, but would consider substituting regular chicken with cultured chicken.\nWhile only members can make reservations to dine at 1880, the brand has also recently launched an exclusive menu prepared in collaboration with its chef Kaimana Chee, which can be ordered by the public via foodpanda. Dishes include katsu chicken curry and Caesar salad.\n\n\nAnd even if you are a devoted meat lover, having access to a wider variety of alt-meats is not necessarily a bad thing. For one, it means there will be more places where it will be a breeze to satisfy gatherings where you have friends of varied dietary preferences.\nPlus, one of the greatest joys of dining out is discovering something new and interesting that might just change some preconceived notion that you might have about your palate. To inspire your foodie adventures, CNA Luxury did a taste test at some of Singapore’s most well-regarded restaurants to hunt down the most delicious plant-based meat dishes available.\n\n\nADDA\nAdda, the new restaurant by Manjunath Mural, former executive chef of Michelin-starred The Song of India, is a fun destination to enjoy a more relaxed but still elevated take on Indian cuisine. Mural’s playful version neo-Indian soul food is most evident in the three TiNDLE chicken dishes on the menu.\nFor a showstopper, order the butter TiNDLE pot pie where the classic British pot pie meets Indian favourite butter chicken. The murgh makhani curry is served in a pot which is sealed with a wonderfully flaky pastry crust that is sliced open when served at your table.\nSink your teeth into generous chunks of plant-based chicken, with generous lashings of rich, creamy curry and be slightly in awe as you tear apart what might just be the meatiest non-meat dish you have ever tried.\nAnother winner are the desi tacos, where TiNDLE chicken strips are marinated overnight in spices before they are cooked, imparting flavours that are as intense as tandoori chicken fresh out of the oven.\nABURI-EN\nIt is indeed a sign that the times are a changin’ when a restaurant known for its grilled-meat donburi bowls – always a treat in Japan-mad Singapore – is the first in the country to debut Next Meats, billed as the world’s first plant-based yakiniku meat.\nThe two sets, kalbi or boneless short rib don and stamina teishoku (stir-fried kalbi with cabbage), are the first plant-based dishes on Aburi-En’s menu.\nMade largely from soy proteins, the slices of alt-meats certainly look realistic and the kalbi don even smells irresistibly like chargrilled meat. The stamina teishoku is garnished with a vividly hued Okinawan egg, which adds a creamy smoothness to the dish when it is mixed in.\nStill, when you bite into the meat slices, it is clear that you are eating a very well marinated, chunkier, seitan-like meat alternative. That said, this is not a bad thing. We imagine these bowls will be popular among non-meat eaters who wish to have something other than salad when they dine with their meat-loving friends.\nAfter all, many vegans and vegetarians will likely tell you they don’t necessarily crave the taste of meat anymore. These bowls are also a good choice for those who wish to dig into a hearty meal that does not necessarily have to taste just like beef or pork.\n\n\nBUTCHER BOY\nAnother gem of a find is Asian fusion grill and bar Butcher Boy, which surprisingly has a decent list of plant-based food options to complement its meat-centric menu.\nWe especially love their juicy Karana potstickers, which are stuffed with mushrooms and jackfruit “meat” and fried to give a delightfully crispy crust. What pulls this dish together is the specially concocted spring onion vinaigrette which adds a fresh tangy burst of flavour to this dish.\nCombine this with its other yummy vegetarian dishes like aubergine tempura or edamame hummus for a wholesome yet filling plant-based meal.\nCANDLENUT\nPeranakan food, as most of us know, tends to go heavy on the meat and seafood ingredients. So it is great to know that one-Michelin-starred joint Candlenut is taking baby steps to adapt to changing dining sensibilities.\nIts Karana ngoh hiang, which is made with jackfruit-based “pork”, is a good start. Sourced from small farms in Sri Lanka, Karana is made from jackfruit which quite magically does not have the pungent flavour of the fruit, which can be an acquired taste, while still preserving its shredded or minced meat texture.\nWhen marinated with five spice and dipped into sticky, sweet sauce and chilli, this plant-based ngoh hiang is a yummy and guilt-free appetiser to start off a hearty Peranakan meal.\nEMPRESS\nNon-meat eaters have long gravitated to this beautifully designed restaurant along the Singapore river for its wide selection of well-executed meatless dishes.\nSo it is not surprising that Empress, part of the Prive Group, also offers a carefully curated range of alternative meat dishes made from a variety of brands including OmniMeat, Impossible and TiNDLE.\nIts Dragon’s Breath Hor Fun, made with Impossible meatballs, is an immediate winner. The noodles are masterfully scorched with dragon’s fire (we mean wok hei) and the juicy Impossible meatballs are just the slightest shade of pink in the middle. So good you won’t even miss the absence of seafood or real beef.\nAnother fun dish to try is the lemon TiNDLE chicken, which looks and tastes pretty much like a katsu-style patty. This homegrown, soy-based chicken, which contains just nine ingredients including sunflower oil and coconut fat for texture and mouthfeel, has a tender bite and none of that stringy dryness that plagues real chicken meat when it gets overcooked.\n\n\nTUNGLOK SIGNATURES\nThe next time you host a family luncheon at TungLok Signatures, one of the grand dames of elegant Chinese dining in Singapore, add the vegan sweet and sour “pork” with vintage vinegar to your order.\nWith a delicately crispy coating, this umami-laden dish is a dead ringer for the real deal thanks to the chunky texture and juicy bite of the soy-based meat substitute NoChicken Chunks by The Vegetarian Butcher, which does not have the chalky taste of some other soy-based meats.\nOr better yet, call ahead and ask the chefs to whip up a custom plant-based menu for you, including the hugely addictive vegan chicken chips and stir-fried ee-fu noodles with vegan chicken for you to get a better sense of the versatility of the alternative meats.\nThe Vegetarian Butcher, which started out as an alternative butcher in Holland before it was acquired by Unilever, has partnered with the TungLok Group to offer plant-based proteins at six more of the group’s dining concepts, including Qin, TungLok Heen and Duckland.\nYAN\nWith a focus on light, flavoursome dishes, fine Cantonese restaurant Yan's\xa0newly launched Joy of Spring a la carte menu offers a range of vegetable-forward fare that include plant-based dishes created in partnership with social enterprise Green Monday.\nWhat this National Gallery dining spot, which is popular among business executives and ladies who lunch alike, gets right off the bat is that the plant-based meats are best used to complement the dishes by adding a “meaty” texture, while allowing the flavours of other ingredients to shine.\nDon’t miss the delicious braised rice vermicelli with minced OmniMeat and eggplant – the noodles are braised in such a rich vegetable stock that all it takes is a sprinkling of minced meat substitute to give the dish some “bite”.\nAnother favourite is the nostalgic steamed beancurd with pickled vegetables and minced OmniMeat, in place of regular minced meat. Again, this comfort food derives most of its taste from the mushrooms and pickled veggies, so you won’t even quibble over the use of a plant-based meat even if you not-so-secretly prefer the actual thing.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Singapore ', '     food ', '     Restaurants ']}"

      In Telok Ayer, a new way to dine in Singapore: Learn while you eat
  </h1>, 'text': 'Did you know that the Chinese language was influenced by the languages of the Turkic and Altaic tribes living around China’s periphery? Or that wheat brought from Europe altered the eating habits of the people of North, Central and South America? Or that as members of the cashew family, pink peppercorns can cause allergic reactions in people with nut allergies?\nMe neither, but I do now since I consumed these nuggets of information at dinner one night as part of the R&D Sessions at Appetite, the research arm of, and multi-concept space that sits above, Nouri.\n\n\nSeveral times a month, diners can buy into these eye-opening meals that take place at the restaurant’s intimate eight-seat counter behind which chef-owner Ivan Brehm and his Appetite culinary team, headed by Ashlee Malligan, serve an eight- to 14-course menu that explores food history in an unprecedented way.\nTo wit, our dinner featured elements as diverse as rasam and kimchi, skyr and tortilla, with each dish embodying origin stories that take surprising turns. Through a course of crisp, palm-sized appam topped with caviar and served with a mound of beet chutney and mustard, we learn about what Brehm calls “a very deep connection between the Indian empires, Coptic Christian origins and the Jewish diaspora, and how the movement of these ancient religious people enhanced the culinary traditions of places like South Asia”.\nIn the package of notes given to diners at the start of the meal (don’t fret, you may peruse them post-meal), a card explains that according to Jewish food writer and historian Gil Marks, “the three separate Jewish communities of Cochin, Mumbai and Calcutta in India have a variation of the hopper as a staple dish amongst them. He therefore speculates that it might have originated with them in the Indian subcontinent”.\nPut simply, appam or hoppers could well have begun with the Jews.\n\n\nAROUND THE WORLD IN SEVERAL PLATES\n“That connection really explained a ton of stuff for us and opened further questions about their daily use and fermentation, and the link between North African and South Asian fermentation techniques. We were so excited to make that loop,” said Brehm.\n“It’s always good to use trademark dishes like appam to talk about historical connections around the world. Dishes like that, which people recognise as very local but now seen from different optics, help open the window for people to see these cross-cultural links and how one tradition is always linked to another.”\nIn the same way, kueh rose, that honeycomb cracker familiar to most Singaporeans, provided another opportunity to discuss how things that are now instantly recognisable as Asian staples actually have their roots elsewhere.\nBrehm served the cracker made from kueh pie tee batter filled with wagyu nduja made from only Korean ingredients. Alongside it sat a tortilla de camarones or shrimp fritter that is not unlike cucur udang (Malay shrimp fritters).\nThese fried batters are commonly recognised to have arrived in Southeast Asia by way of British and Portuguese influence, but Brehm says that further research revealed that Spanish and Portuguese food traditions owe much to their Arabic invaders.\n“The Moors seem to have been the first to introduce fried battered dishes to the Portuguese and Spanish. The tortilla de camarones gave us the opportunity to talk about the origins of tempura, introduced to the Japanese by the Portuguese,” explained Brehm. \xa0“Peixinhos da horta (garden fish), tempura’s distant cousin, is an example of several battered dishes of Portuguese and Spanish origin”\n”Dishes like [appam], which people recognise as very local but now seen from different optics, help open the window for people to see these cross-cultural links and how one tradition is always linked to another.” – Ivan Brehm\n\n\nEAT AND LEARN… OR JUST EAT\nThese R&D Sessions often reflect the projects that Appetite’s research team might be working on as part of their consultancies or development work for corporate clients. Or they may simply be explorations into the crossroads-of-culture theme that has long shaped Brehm’s ethos at Nouri.\nResearch and history may lay the foundations of these meals, but it never feels like a classroom that serves Michelin-worthy food. Even if delving into antiquity is not your cup of vegetable broth, an R&D meal here is much like any other – that is, rooted in exquisite food, warm service and served against an eclectic playlist.\nYou can choose to ignore Brehm as he waxes intelligently about the Arabic roots of dumplings by nodding and making appreciative sounds as you nibble your food, or engage him by suggesting extrapolations of your own. The meals – available at lunch and dinner, and priced between S$300 and S$400 – are about curiosity, exchanges and discovery.\n“This intimate environment allows us very immediate feedback from guests that we wouldn’t otherwise have,” said Brehm. “In exchange for that, as you eat, we give as much information as we can about the things we are working on and why they are important and you then help us to perfect them (with your feedback). Sometimes it happens in unexpected ways, like someone would say, ‘this reminds me of a particular dish’ and we go and research it and it’s dead on the money.\n“The overall goal is really to facilitate and get people to question more deeply their notion of identity. I find that especially important today. We have this specific notion of who we are and where we are from, but that’s been crystallised without much scrutiny.\n“When we do the deep investigation, we start to realise that nothing is really as it seems. Perhaps we should start looking at one another with a bit more respect, curiosity and openness. That’s the overarching concept behind all our projects, to reconnect people to themselves, to product and to experience in a less transactional and more direct way.”\n“The overall goal is really to facilitate and get people to question more deeply their notion of identity. I find that especially important today.” – Ivan Brehm\nTo book, visit Appetite’s Instagram page where R&D Session dates are announced a month in advance. \xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     Singapore ', '     food ', '     F&B ', '     gastronomy ', '     Chefs ', '     Restaurants ', '     Fine dining ']}"

      Creative Capital: The vegan baker whose chocolate cupcakes inspire rave reviews
  </h1>, 'text': 'I have never been a huge chocoholic. My wife, daughter and younger son are, though. So I am always on the lookout for nice, yummy, well-made chocolate treats to buy for them.\n\nRecently, a friend started telling me about his favourite chocolate cupcakes. Actually, he didn’t just tell me. It was more akin to a Southern Baptist testifying before God in a Mississippi church. He was that enthusiastic in his praise. I was almost expecting him to do a backflip and start speaking in tongues.\nWhat interested me most – about the cupcakes, not my friend’s enthusiasm – was that the cupcakes were vegan, gluten-free and contained avocado.\nCuriosity piqued, I dug up a little more information on ROA, founded two years ago by 39-year-old Singaporean Jane Tan. The various reviews and testimonials I found equalled my own friend’s unbridled love for Ms Tan’s cakes, so much so that I reached out to her to chat.\n\n\nHI, JANE. TELL ME ABOUT YOUR LIFE BEFORE ROA. WHAT DID YOU DO?\nI was working in a local bank as a HR professional. Prior to that, I was also a flight attendant at a local airline for a short period. I was adamant about wanting to travel all over the world after university. I’ve always enjoyed exploration and whenever I travelled, I sought out delicious pastries and desserts.\nWERE YOU ALWAYS A FOODIE?\nYes. I was brought up to enjoy all kinds of cuisines. My dad would bring us to eat at various places, from the finest exotic restaurants to the most delicious hawker fare. We were raised never to be picky with food and learnt to enjoy all kinds. That being said, I never once thought I would be making pastry full-time.\nWHAT PROMPTED YOU TO MAKE THE SWITCH TO PASTRY? LEAVING THE CORPORATE WORLD TO GO TO CULINARY SCHOOL IS A PRETTY BIG DECISION. WAS THERE A CATALYST?\nI had been working in the bank for about five years and I felt like I had explored enough to figure out corporate life wasn’t what I wanted. During that time, I had already been baking a lot for various charity events and also taking small-time orders for friends and family. All that made me seriously consider going to culinary school. Coincidentally, soon after I got married, I knew it was a good time for me to make the switch, before kids and all. It was now or never.\nTELL ME ABOUT YOUR TIME IN SYDNEY. IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU WORKED WITH SOME AMAZING AND WELL-KNOWN CHEFS.\nIt was an incredible experience. The intensive training at Le Cordon Bleu gave me a good foundation in the science and art of baking. It also trained me in the basics and techniques of the pastry world.\nWorkwise, being completely new to the industry, I decided that I had to start out as a waitress at a local Australian cafe, just to get my hands dirty and to learn from the ground up. But a few months in, I managed to wheedle my way into the kitchen. I guess it was sheer hard work and determination – and knocking on many doors\xa0– that eventually helped me to land a full-time job at one of the top cake designers in Australia, Faye Cahill Cake Design.\nI also worked alongside and assisted chefs like Australian representative Andre Sandison during the training sessions for the Asian Pastry Cup\xa0– and yes, he won it! Stints with other celebrity chefs like Luke Ngyuen and Adriano Zumbo also exposed me to how professional kitchens are managed at the highest standards. I wanted to get as much exposure as possible, so I held down multiple jobs\xa0– three at a time even\xa0– and sometimes even worked without pay. But the experience was invaluable and I came back with a lot of knowledge that couldn’t be bought.\nDID YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU CAME HOME, THAT YOU WANTED TO START YOUR OWN BUSINESS RIGHT AWAY?\nWhen I first came back to Singapore, I had a baby! Taking care of a newborn meant I had to put my career on hold. However, the passion in me was so strong that five months after I gave birth, I was back to baking for others. That’s when I started my first home-based business making celebration cakes for people. It grew rather quickly and soon, I was booked out 12 months in advance. I knew then that running my own business was truly fulfilling and my calling.\nWHAT IS THE STORY BEHIND ROA?\nWhile making cakes for a lot of people, especially young kids, I kept getting requests from parents to omit certain ingredients like sugar, eggs or nuts, as they or their kids were allergic, or they just wanted to follow a certain diet. I used to turn them away as I didn’t want to compromise the taste. Omitting ingredients changes the taste and texture of a cake drastically. But it was when my own goddaughter Emma was allergic to four out of the top five most commonly found allergens\xa0– nuts, eggs, gluten and dairy\xa0– that I knew I had to do something. I truly wanted her to enjoy a delicious cake. I also knew at the back of my mind that many others like her would appreciate it.\nI UNDERSTAND THAT PERFECTING YOUR VEGAN CHOCOLATE CAKE RECIPE TOOK NINE MONTHS. WHY WAS IT SO DIFFICULT?\nIt was difficult as it was more than just switching out ingredients with substitutes. For example, changing butter to margarine would have been a quick and cheap fix. But nutritionally, that’s not great. The exploration in search of more wholesome ingredients, like avocado for example, meant a lot more work and a lot more testing to perfect the cake.\nThe biggest challenge was making the product gluten-free. If you are into food science, you may know that wheat flour contains gluten and is what gives cakes their light springy texture. Often, gluten-free products are thought of as dry, hard and dense as common substitutes are nuts, beans and chickpeas. I was adamant about wanting to make a light, fluffy cake without any artificial stabilisers. I used my own flour blend consisting of four different natural, gluten-free flours – potato, corn, rice and tapioca. This meant a whole lot of testing as each flour has different binding and raising properties.\nEven after the initial launch of the product, I continued to get feedback from paying customers, and I kept tweaking the recipe. For example, instead of canola oil, which is what we used to blend with our avocados, I switched to rice bran oil. I learnt from my customers that canola actually isn’t the healthiest product\xa0– it is highly processed. There’s nothing like truly listening to your customers and embracing ongoing change positively.\xa0\nSO, WHAT IS THE SECRET TO WHY YOUR CAKES ARE SO GOOD? OR IS IT REALLY A SECRET?\nThe secret is truly in the high-quality ingredients used. There are really no two ways about it. You are what you eat, and your taste buds know it. I get customers telling me they go, “Mmmm” when they taste our cakes because they instantly know that we use good quality chocolate.\nIt also helps that the people who make the cakes are a bunch of very positive and happy individuals. The old adage about the food being as good as the emotional state of the chef is very true. Happy chefs make delicious food! Our team is a truly bonded group and we are usually in the best of spirits. I think this really helps, too.\nWHEN YOU SET ABOUT TO CREATE THE CAKE FOR YOUR GODDAUGHTER, WERE YOU ALREADY THINKING ABOUT A NEW BUSINESS AND A NEW MARKET SEGMENT, OR DID IT ALL HAPPEN ORGANICALLY?\nWhen the cake was so well received, it felt very heartwarming. The turning point was when I had some friends who said, “Finally, a birthday I can actually enjoy!” Instinctively, I knew that many others would appreciate this. More than that, it was a great way to be inclusive. This kind of cake means no one gets left out of enjoying a celebration because of food allergies and intolerances.\nBY THE NATURE OF YOUR INGREDIENTS, YOUR CAKES ARE VEGAN. DO YOU THINK VEGAN BRANDS GET A BAD RAP?\nI think the term “vegan” evokes a love-hate emotion for a lot of people. The problem is an old-school mindset about alternative proteins\xa0– think mock vegetarian meats\xa0– or eating only salads. The misconception that vegan food is bland and tasteless can put many people off. Thankfully, this is all changing, with many new, upcoming, awesome-tasting brands that wow people all the time.\nWhen it comes to dessert and cakes, I find that it’s a lot less intimidating as most cakes are already vegetarian to begin with. But when you say vegan\xa0– no butter or eggs\xa0– some people can be skeptical. I always joke that all I need to do is to get some of my cakes into their mouths, and the rest will be history. Thankfully, many positive online reviews have helped and my business has grown organically. We have been blessed with great word-of-mouth since Day One.\nWHAT’S YOUR IMPRESSION OF THE PLANT-BASED MOVEMENT HERE? IT FEELS LIKE IT’S GROWING RAPIDLY.\nDefinitely! The fact that so many new, alternative protein brands are growing right here in Singapore is a telling sign. That an increasing number of eateries have plant-based options on their menus shows growing demand. As someone who is largely plant-based myself, I often keep a lookout for options and am usually pleasantly surprised to find that eight out of 10 places do offer some form of plant-based alternative – even if it’s something as simple as soy or oat milk for your coffee.\nWHAT IS A TYPICAL DAY LIKE FOR YOU?\nAfter the morning mum duties, I often head to the kitchen to check in with the team. Once I know that the operations are running smoothly, I attend to all my messages and emails. I also do taste tests on batches of cakes made. Then it’s usually meetings with clients and suppliers until the end of the day, when I have to resume my parental duties. Once my two girls are in bed, I continue to oversee the operations and planning for the day or week.\nWHAT PART OF YOUR WORK DO YOU ENJOY THE MOST?\nI actually love brainstorming ideas. These days it is split between growing the business\xa0– I’m on the lookout for potential collaborations\xa0– and thinking of new flavours and products for the coming year.\nANY REALLY REWARDING MOMENTS SINCE STARTING ROA THAT YOU CAN SHARE?\nThere have been three times when I have had people tell me their cakes made them tear up! Tears of joy, thankfully. I distinctly recall one lady who came to pick up her cakes during Christmastime and described the first time she tried my cakes, which had been a few months prior. She had just had bloodwork done and been told by doctors to avoid a whole range of foods. When she finally found my cakes at a cafe that sold them and tried a slice, tears rolled down her cheeks. Her story made my hair stand, and my own eyes welled up. She was so glad that she could enjoy desserts again. What an emotional ride it was for her, and for me, too.\nWHAT HAS BEEN YOUR HERO PRODUCT?\nThe bestseller is our Midnight Classique cupcake. This is the best size for eating enjoyment and can be stored easily. I guess it’s versatile as you can enjoy it as a regular cupcake or warm and serve it as a decadent lava cake. I often hear of people enjoying it close to midnight whenever they want a treat to wind down at the end of a long day.\xa0ARE YOU DOING ANYTHING COOL THIS YEAR THAT YOU WANT READERS TO KNOW ABOUT?\nWe are planning a whole new range of desserts, such as chocolate cake truffles. We are also exploring different styles of celebration cakes to cater to a wider audience. While we innovate, we will of course stay true to what ROA stands for: Desserts that are ethically made, luxurious and delicious, and don’t contain dairy, eggs, nuts, soy or gluten, the five most common food allergens.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Trending ', '     food ', '     Chefs ', ""     Women's Voices ""]}"

      Bak chor mee: The first thing that restaurateur Yenn Wong wants once she’s back
  </h1>, 'text': 'Overlooking the colonial era architecture of Tai Kwun, Hong Kong\'s classy rebirth of a 19th-century police station in the heart of Central, Between is one of the city\'s hottest new caffeine-fuelled spots.\nThe all-day-dining space is full at 4pm, with influencers – both aspiring and real – waiting in turn for space on the balcony to get the perfect backdrop shot. Its popularity is testament to the savvy of Singapore-born restaurateur Yenn Wong from JIA Group, a hospitality entrepreneur with a portfolio of restaurants garlanded with Michelin stars and places on the prestigious list of Asia\'s 50 Best Restaurants.\n\n\nA post shared by Between (@_betweencoffee_)\n\n\nWhile Between isn\'t on the radar for Michelin inspectors, it has quickly become a popular draw for a young crowd seeking signature blends by baristas, coffee cocktails and Japanese cafe dishes, all served within a space celebrating art and design.\nIt\'s also emblematic of Wong\'s ability to pivot – surely one of the defining words of 2020 – from one project to another. The space was formerly Old Bailey, a restaurant celebrating dishes from Shanghai, Hangzhou and Suzhou.\nIn common with everyone in the embattled Hong Kong dining landscape, reinvention was critical as the industry came under unimaginable pandemic-induced pressure. At one point, four of her fifteen restaurants closed completely, although they\'re now back to that total with new ventures and formats.\n""We\'ve been very reactive to the situation, but as a company it was very difficult. We started focusing on deliveries, but running mid to high-end restaurants, doing HK$70 (S$12) rice boxes made it hard to survive. So we launched a Peking duck dinner from Duddell\'s and roast chicken from Louise, as well as different home-cooked meals. We opened fine dining from 11.30am to 6pm to do more than just lunch. We had our chefs cooking in homes for little celebrations, offered hampers, cakes, products – anything we could sell.""\xa0 \xa0 \xa0\n""We don\'t want to become a Deliveroo, we\'re trying to become a more bespoke delivery platform, especially for bigger orders. We\'re playing with the idea of a cloud kitchen concept, a central kitchen built up with the facility for different cuisines, of eight to 10 virtual brands developed by existing restaurants. Online pastry brands, ordering cakes from Instagram – Western, Chinese, Southeast Asian. It has to be flexible, so if it doesn\'t work out, just change it. Bricks-and-mortar is a risky business.""\nOne area hit particularly hard during COVID-19 has been Chinese restaurants, given their dependence on larger group dining.\n""Old Bailey was set up for events, which we simply didn\'t have. With Chinese kitchens it\'s very different compared to other cuisines as you need the volume. We discussed what would be great here and a 3,000 sq ft cafe was a risk, but we wanted all-day dining and as a company we\'re very keen to have a younger crowd of customers, to progress and stay relevant and nurture the next generation.""\nShe\'s keen to stress that through the pandemic, the Hong Kong restaurant industry showed a lot of support to one another, sharing information and the latest updates. At the same time, she characterises Hong Kong as a robust city where “self-disciplined and careful” people have helped to contain the spread. As things stand now, she hopes that vaccinations will show light at the end of the tunnel.\n""I\'m really for vaccination and it\'s good to be an example for my staff. It\'s the way we can have some sort of normality.”\n\n\nKITCHEN CONFIDENTIAL\nWong counts some of Asia\'s most awarded and respected chefs among her portfolio, not least of whom are Julien Royer and Ricardo Chaneton. Royer is of course best known for Odette in the National Gallery of Singapore, formerly Asia\'s Best Restaurant, but he is also chef-founder at JIA Group\'s one-Michelin-starred Louise in Hong Kong, an Andre Fu-designed two-storey heritage house.\n""Julien is the most un-French person I know! He even has Singapore slang when he speaks English! I\'ve never seen him aggressive, never lose his temper, his focus is so strong. He focuses on his food and customers, there\'s so much noise with social media and difficult guests, but he never gets upset and still keeps his cool. I\'ve learnt a lot from him, that he has managed to not fret about things not worth it and focus on the important things.”\n""He had an amazing salad with everything grown in Singapore, with rojak ginger flower. It\'s amazing to create such a high-quality dish and find that familiarity with one of the local ingredients. Every time there\'s that improvement, it\'s not conceptual, it\'s still very real as food.”\nBack in Hong Kong, another chef making real waves in her group is Ricardo Chaneton at the highly-regarded Mono, a recent addition to Asia\'s 50 Best Restaurants list thanks to its fabulous mix of cultures, flavours and ingredients. The Venezuelan worked for years as head chef at the legendary three-Michelin-starred Mirazur in Menton outside Monaco. In Hong Kong\'s Central district, however, Wong has let him return to his roots.\n""We like to take calculated risks. With someone like Ricardo, he was thinking about the direction he should go. We talked a lot about his home town and where he came from. You need more than strong techniques – you need feelings, passion, memories – when you sit in the restaurant people really feel it. So with Ricardo going more to Latin America, it was his own choice. It\'s great you have some roots to what you\'re doing.""\n\n\nTalking of roots, I ask Wong about her upbringing in Singapore, culinary and otherwise. She admits with a laugh that, as a teenager, she would grumble when her mum took her to a hawker centre as she wanted to go to “the fancy places”.\nWhen she does next get back – the last time was last February – the first dish she\'ll go for is the Hokkien minced pork noodle favourite, bak chor mee, something she misses as ""it\'s impossible to get the right taste”.\nI ask her impression as to the key difference between Hong Kong and Singapore dining.\n""Singapore has stronger flavours in terms of local food. In Hong Kong, the local food is quite ingredient-based, there\'s a lot more focus on the taste of the ingredients. Everything comes with chilli in Singapore and there\'s bigger variety in terms of Malay, Indian, Chinese, all kinds of influences. Hong Kong food has more north Asian influences.""\nWong previously owned restaurants in Singapore, so it begs the question whether she would consider opening up there again?\n""I stopped doing restaurants there because the concepts need a personal touch. When I got married here (to property developer and fellow restaurateur Alan Lo) and had my first child, I made the decision to travel less and wanted to focus on Hong Kong. Singapore has a very vibrant food scene, but the challenge of labour is tough, everyone is scrambling for staff. It\'s easy to get a strong head chef or GM but hard to find other staff. It\'s a big challenge to run restaurants in Singapore.”\n“Singapore has a very vibrant food scene, but the challenge of labour is tough, everyone is scrambling for staff. It\'s easy to get a strong head chef or GM but hard to find other staff.” – Yenn Wong\nUltimately, despite a brutal 18 months of protests, COVID-19-enforced closures and downsizing, Wong has emerged with newfound accolades: a Michelin star and Asia\'s 50 Best Restaurants acclaim for Ando and Mono, respectively.\n""It means a lot and I\'m happy that in this climate we\'re focused and able to achieve that, to give the chefs the freedom and creative space to do what they want to, and to nurture each other as well. I\'ve had a really fruitful journey and continue to learn and progress. Let\'s see where it will lead us to.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     Singapore ', '     Hong Kong ', '     Restaurants ', '     food ', '     F&B ', '     business ', ""     Women's Life "", ""     Women's Voices ""]}"

      Taste of home: Malaysian actress offers Kelantan food at Toa Payoh hawker stall
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: The Toa Payoh Lorong 4 hawker centre situated in Singapore’s heartlands is renowned for cheap and good local delights – Hokkien mee, kway chap and wonton noodles.\xa0\nHowever, over the last few months, diners have another reason to visit -\xa0a stall offering\xa0Kelantanese cuisine.\nThe stall named Kelate, which is the colloquial name for the east coast\xa0state in Malaysia, is run by former actress Sasqia Dahuri.\nThe Malaysian model has starred in films such as Misteri Dilaila (2019) and Senario the Movie: Ops Pocot (2011). But she has now swapped her career in glitzy showbusiness for gritty hawker gloves after she opened Kelate earlier this year.\nA year ago, due to travel restrictions, Sasqia decided to settle down in Singapore with her Singaporean husband, Muhammad Asyraff Khan.\nAt the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Sasqia began to miss Kelantanese dishes like those cooked by her mother, so she took it upon herself to prepare them for her husband and his family.\n\n\nWhen she earned rave reviews, she decided to cook for her husband’s friends and eventually started a home-based business.\n“In Malaysia, Kelantanese food is hugely popular. But I’ve been surprised by how Singaporeans have taken to it,” said Sasqia.\n“When I was just trying it out, my husband invited his friends over to try the dishes. I suggested we order pizza in case they didn’t like the food, but they each ate three to five plates of laksam. Chinese, Malay… all Singaporeans love the food,” she said.\nEncouraged, she decided to expand the home-based business\xa0and turn it into Kelate - a stall dedicated to Kelantanese cuisine.\nTHREE ITEMS ON THE MENU\xa0\nPrioritising quality over quantity, Kelate’s menu features only three dishes - the recipes of which were taught to Sasqia by her mother, who is Kelantanese-Thai.\nKelate’s two mains are laksam, which is a Kelantanese variant of laksa, and mee celup, Kelantan’s take on Thai beef noodle soup.\nLaksam is the stall’s most popular dish, priced at S$4.90 for a small bowl, S$6.90 for medium and S$7.90 for large.\nIt consists of soft rice noodles rolled neatly into cylindrical shape and served in a pool of creamy gravy that is\xa0rich with coconut milk and lip-smackingly savoury with its blend of spices and flaked fish.\nThe dish has a good balance of creaminess, known in Malay as lemak, sweetness and spices.\nWhile laksam’s pale gravy and white rice rolls may come across as simple, it requires tedious preparation.\xa0\nThe noodles are made from scratch\xa0and Sasqia takes around five hours to do so in the wee hours of every morning.\n\n\n“We need to steam the noodle rolls, and every aspect has to be perfect – the temperature, type of steamer we use, how we store the rolls. People love it and it sells well, but it’s very difficult to make,” said Sasqia.\n“It gets crazy sometimes, and laksam may get sold out at 11am. People come over and buy 15 to 20 packets, but that’s something we cannot control,” she added.\nHer other main dish, mee celup, may seem like the secondary choice, but it packs a punch as well.\nThe soup noodle's broth is made from beef and chicken bones, giving it depth and a lightness in flavour. The noodles are topped with preserved mustard leaves and chunks of beef.\nThe meat is tender because Sasqia only uses specific cuts of beef.\n“We only use certain parts of the beef, and we boil the meat with more stock so that the flavour is more intense,” she explained.\nThe prices for mee celup are\xa0the same as laksam’s.\nThe last item on the menu is\xa0appetiser colek malah, anchovy-vegetable fritters served with a special dip.\nCrispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, colek malah is a delight, especially when it is\xa0drenched in the accompanying sweet and spicy chilli sauce.\nIt is priced at S$4 for three pieces and S$7 for six pieces.\xa0\nSasqia explained that this dish reminded her of home the most, as many Kelantanese consume it for a midday snack.\n“In Kelantan they pour the sauce on top of the fritters and eat them with a spoon,” she said.\nA TASTE OF HOME FOR MALAYSIANS\nKelate has garnered encouraging reception from people\xa0in Toa Payoh, and some customers also visit from other parts of the island.\nBut Sasqia is especially touched by how the stall has become a gathering point for some Malaysians who have not returned home due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n“For some of the Malaysians who come, eating these dishes has a sentimental value for them. When they eat laksam, it reminds them of stories with their grandmother, or parents, or of their experiences in their kampung and hometown,” said Sasqia.\n“When they tell me this, I feel that all this hard work becomes worth it,” she added.\n\n\nOne Malaysian who felt that the food reminded him of his hometown was Chia Sin Hui, who comes from Kota Bharu in Kelantan but has lived in Singapore for 30 years.\nChia told CNA that the laksam he ordered reminded him of his childhood.\n“It's as good as what you get back home. Very authentic,” he added.\nMeanwhile, Selen Yap, who ordered the mee celup, also had compliments.\n“I’ve been working in Singapore for eight years but I’ve not tasted something so close to what I usually eat back home,” said the 30-year-old from Kuala Lumpur.\nFor Ramadan, Sasqia is offering\xa0two new items\xa0– nasi kerabu kuning, or yellow rice mixed with salad and sambal tumis, as well as lompat tikam, a soft rice pudding with coconut milk and gula melaka.\nShe has also expanded her business slightly by having a central kitchen in Clementi for food preparation and buying a company van to make deliveries.\nAsked whether she would be keen to open a cafe or restaurant,\xa0Sasqia seemed hesitant.\n“I like opening this humble stall in a hawker centre. A restaurant gives off a different vibe, more high-end. Hawker stalls are for everyone and I want to cater to everybody,” she said.\n“I’m friends with the hawker uncles and aunties here, and it’s a nice feeling, a nice community. I like being around people, my customers and other stallholders. This is what I want,” she added.\nRead this story in Bahasa Melayu here.\xa0\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Malaysia ', '     food ', '     Kelantan ', '     Toa Payoh ', '     Trending ', '     women ', '     food ']}"

      Buat lepas rindu, pelakon Malaysia jual masakan Kelantan di gerai Singapura
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPURA: Pusat penjaja Lorong 4 Toa Payoh yang terletak di Singapura terkenal dengan makanan jalanan yang murah dan enak seperti mi Hokkien, mi kuay chap dan mi wantan.\xa0\nNamun dalam tempoh beberapa bulan kebelakangan ini, pengunjung mempunyai satu lagi alasan untuk ke pusat penjaja ini iaitu sebuah gerai yang menawarkan masakan asal negeri Kelantan.\nGerai yang diberi nama Kelate sempena negeri di Pantai Timur Semenanjung Malaysia tersebut dikendalikan oleh bekas pelakon, Sasqia Dahuri.\nModel yang berasal dari Malaysia ini pernah membintangi filem seperti Misteri Dilaila (2019) dan Senario the Movie: Ops Pocot (2011). Beliau kini meninggalkan dunia hiburan yang penuh glamor dan beralih ke bidang perniagaan setelah membuka Kelate awal tahun ini.\nSetahun lalu, disebabkan sekatan pergerakan, Sasqia mengambil keputusan menetap di Singapura bersama-sama suami beliau, seorang warga Singapura bernama Muhammad Asyraff Khan.\nKetika wabak COVID-19 memuncak pada 2020, Sasqia mula merindui masakan Kelantan seperti yang dimasak oleh ibunya. Beliau lantas menyediakan sendiri masakan yang sama untuk suami dan keluarga.\nSetelah masakan beliau mula mendapat perhatian, Sasqia memasak pula untuk sahabat-sahabat suaminya dan mula berniaga dari rumah.\n“Di Malaysia, masakan Kelantan cukup popular. Namun saya terkejut melihat sambutan yang diterima daripada warga Singapura,” kata Sasqia.\n“Asalnya saya hanya memasak secara suka-suka. Suami mempelawa rakan-rakannya ke rumah untuk mencuba masakan saya. Saya mencadangkan kami memesan piza, takut-takut mereka tidak menyukai masakan saya, tetapi rupa-rupanya mereka menghabiskan tiga ke lima pinggan laksam seorang. Baik yang berbangsa Cina mahu pun Melayu, orang Singapura gemarkan masakan ini,” ujar beliau.\nDengan galakan yang diterima, beliau mengambil keputusan meluaskan perniagaan dari rumahnya ke gerai Kelate yang mengkhusus dalam masakan asal negeri Kelantan.\nTIGA ITEM DALAM MENU\xa0\nDemi memelihara kualiti dan keaslian, menu Kelate menampilkan hanya tiga resipi yang telah diajar oleh ibu Sasqia yang berdarah kacukan Thai-Kelantan kepada beliau.\nDua hidangan utama Kelate adalah laksam yang merupakan sejenis laksa versi Kelantan, dan mi celup yang merupakan mi sup daging Thai ala Kelantan.\nLaksam yang merupakan hidangan paling popular di gerai ini berharga S$4.90 (RM15.20) untuk semangkuk kecil, S$6.90 untuk saiz sederhana dan S$7.90 untuk saiz besar.\nLaksam terdiri daripada mi leper dibuat daripada tepung beras yang digulung menjadi silinder dan dihidang dalam kuah santan berkrim yang kaya dengan adunan bahan dan isi ikan dikisar. Ia benar-benar membangkitkan selera.\nRasa laksam merupakan campuran rasa lemak, manis dan rempah-ratus.\nMeskipun kuah putih laksam dan gulungan mi putihnya nampak ringkas, penyediaannya bukan mudah.\xa0\nMi laksam Kelate dibuat oleh Sasqia sendiri. Beliau mengambil masa kira-kira lima jam membuatnya pada waktu dinihari.\n“Mi laksam perlu dikukus dan setiap aspek perlu dibuat dengan teliti termasuk suhunya, jenis pengukus yang kita gunakan dan cara kita menyimpan gulungan laksam ini. Memang laksam digemari ramai dan laku dijual, namun menyediakannya amat sukar,” kata Sasqia.\n“Ada kalanya laksam sangat laku sehingga habis terjual pada jam 11 pagi. Pengunjung datang dan membeli 15 hingga 20 pek seorang. Ini bukanlah sesuatu yang kita boleh kawal,” tambah beliau.\nHidangan utama yang satu lagi, mi celup, mungkin kelihatan seperti menu sampingan namun tidak kurang hebatnya.\nAir rebusan hidangan mi ini dibuat daripada tulang lembu dan ayam. Ini memberikan kepekatan dan kelembutan pada rasanya. Mi ini dihidang bersama sawi jeruk dan potongan daging.\nDagingnya lembut kerana Sasqia hanya menggunakan bahagian daging yang khusus.\n“Kami hanya menggunakan bahagian daging tertentu. Kami rebus daging ini dengan air rebusan yang banyak untuk menaikkan rasanya,” jelas beliau.\nHarga mi celup adalah sama seperti harga laksam.\nItem terakhir dalam menu adalah pembuka selera, colek malah, sejenis jemput-jemput mengandungi ikan bilis dan sayur yang dihidang bersama pencicah istimewa.\nRangup di luar dan gebu di dalam, colek malah menjadi kesukaan terutama sekali apabila dimakan secara ""banjir""\xa0dengan sos cili manis berempah yang disediakan.\nHarganya S$4 untuk tiga keping dan S$7 untuk enam.\xa0\nTerang Sasqia, hidangan ini mengimbau kenangan di kampung halaman kerana ia merupakan snek minum petang yang biasa di Kelantan.\n“Di Kelantan, orang menuang sos ke atas jemput-jemput ini dan makan menggunakan sudu,” kata beliau.\nLEPAS RINDU BAGI KOMUNITI MALAYSIA\nKelate telah mendapat sambutan menggalakkan daripada pengunjung di Toa Payoh. Ada juga pelanggan yang datang dari segenap pelosok pulau Singapura\xa0ini.\nSasqia amat terharu melihat gerai beliau menjadi tempat pertemuan sebahagian rakyat Malaysia yang tidak dapat pulang ke tanah air akibat wabak COVID-19.\n“Bagi sebahagian pengunjung rakyat Malaysia, hidangan kami mempunyai nilai sentimental. Menikmati laksam mengingatkan mereka kepada kisah bersama nenek atau ibu bapa serta pengalaman lain di kampung dan bandar kelahiran,” ujar Sasqia.\n“Apabila mereka bercerita kisah mereka, saya rasa kerja keras saya selama ini berbaloi,” kata beliau.\nSalah seorang rakyat Malaysia yang mendapati makanan di Kelate mengingatkannya kepada kampung asal ialah Chia Sin Hui. Beliau berasal dari Kota Bharu di Kelantan tetapi telah menetap di Singapura selama 30 tahun.\nChia memberitahu CNA, laksam yang dipesan mengingatkannya kepada zaman kanak-kanak.\n“Laksam di sini setara dengan apa yang ada di kampung. Memang asli,” kata beliau.\nSelena Yap yang memesan mi celup turut memuji masakan di gerai ini.\n“Saya telah bekerja di Singapura selama lapan tahun tetapi belum pernah merasa masakan yang menyerupai apa yang biasa saya makan di bandar kelahiran,” kata beliau yang berusia 30 tahun dan berasal dari Kuala Lumpur.\nUntuk bulan Ramadan, Sasqia menawarkan dua menu baharu iaitu nasi kerabu kuning, sejenis nasi berwarna kuning dicampur ulam-ulaman dan sambal tumis, dan lompat tikam yang merupakan puding beras lembut yang dimakan bersama santan dan gula melaka.\nBeliau juga meluaskan perniagaannya dengan membuka sebuah dapur berpusat di Clementi untuk penyediaan makanan dan membeli sebuah van syarikat untuk penghantaran.\nDitanya sama ada beliau berminat membuka sebuah kafe atau restoran, Sasqia kelihatan teragak-agak.\n“Saya suka mengendalikan gerai kecil di pusat penjaja ini. Sebuah restoran tidak memberi kegembiraan yang sama kerana perbezaan standard. Gerai penjaja sesuai untuk semua dan memang niat saya ingin memasak untuk semua,” ujar beliau.\n“Saya berkawan dengan para penjaja lain di sini. Saya gembira menjadi ahli komuniti di sini dan berinteraksi dengan orang ramai, para pelanggan dan penjaja lain. Ini yang saya mahukan,” tambah beliau.\nArtikel ini diterjemah dari\xa0Bahasa Inggeris.\nBaca juga artikel Bahasa Melayu\xa0ini tentang pasangan adik-beradik warga emas yang meneruskan profesion mengasah pisau.\nIkuti CNA di\xa0Facebook\xa0dan\xa0Twitter\xa0untuk lebih banyak artikel.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Malaysia ', '     food ', '     Kelantan ', '     Toa Payoh ']}"

      Up Your Alley: Geylang - supper central, buzzing with kampung spirit
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE:\xa0Geylang - home to Singapore\'s red-light district, has much more to offer than nightlife,\xa0those who live and work here were quick to tell me.\n“Geylang is a neighbourhood that is very misunderstood, but there’s also a certain appeal because of how it’s shrouded in this cloud of danger and mystery,” said Cai Yinzhou, founder of Citizen Adventures, a small business that provides tours around the area.\xa0 \xa0\nThe 31-year-old said Geylang wasn’t safe back when he was growing up, recalling instances when he had to go to his sisters’ aid or accompany them home\xa0from the train station if they were returning late.\xa0\nBut things have changed over time.\nBACK ALLEY BARBERS: CUTTING AWAY BARRIERSYou might have heard of the\xa0Geylang Adventures tours which Yinzhou runs, but did you know he is also the founder of a social initiative to help migrant workers get haircuts?\n\xa0“There are so many people here that are misunderstood (here) ...\xa0like migrant workers, sex workers and these are the marginalised in society,"" he said.\n“People are curious to know ... about their lives, but don’t really get a chance to interact or understand them,” he added.\nHe recounted how he used to play badminton with a group of migrant workers behind his house, for example. When he found out one of the workers couldn’t afford to pay for haircuts because of his father’s increasing medical bills, Yinzhou decided to teach himself how to cut hair via YouTube tutorials.\nThis kickstarted the Back Alley Barbers initiative, which started off at Lorong 24A near Yinzhou’s home in 2014. With just chairs and clippers, Yinzhou and a team of volunteer barbers soon offered haircuts to those who needed them – from cardboard collectors to migrant workers.\nIt wasn’t just about giving haircuts, though. Yinzhou described it as similar to a hospital triage zone where their chats would allow the volunteers\xa0to better direct those in need of help\xa0to the right places.\xa0\nFor example, those in need of legal help would be introduced to Transient Workers Count 2 while those in need of medical aid would be directed to HealthServe.\nThis particular\xa0initiative might have been\xa0put on hold because of the COVID-19 pandemic, but Yinzhou and his team of about 80 volunteers are continuing to\xa0offer\xa0their grooming services to migrant workers at their dormitories and wherever there\'s a need.\nENG TIANG HUAT: STEPPING INTO THE PAST\nA stone’s throw away from the Back Alley Barbers is a shop described by visitors as a “living museum” with its memorabilia dating back\xa0a century.\nChinese cultural shop Eng Tiang Huat sits serenely at Geylang Lorong 24A, removed from the din of the main thoroughfare, as\xa0part of a row of shophouses being conserved by local authorities for its historical value.\nEng Tiang Huat, started by Jeffrey’s grandfather, used to sell items used in Chinese opera - also known as wayang - such as hats, whiskers and other props.\xa0Today, the third-generation owner\xa0describes this\xa0as a\xa0""vanishing trade""\xa0but he\'s determined to keep it, and his grandfather\'s name, alive.\xa0\nThe shop is filled with a myriad of curios and gems from\xa0the past such as a typewriter, an abacus, as well as\xa0Chinese string instruments like the guzheng and erhu. A trusty Singer sewing machine dating back to 1937 is still whirring and\xa0sometimes used by\xa0Jeffrey\xa0to restore old tapestries.\nAnd he thinks keeping shops like his is important for preserving a slice of Singapore’s past.\xa0\xa0\n“This (lorong) is very nostalgic … if all these are gone, then Geylang is not different anymore and it will be another Chinatown,” said Jeffrey. “Chinatown is no more - it’s just a name. It’s no more that kind of old, traditional Chinatown. It’s a tourist theme park.\n“But Geylang, no, here you still have these pockets of (heritage).""\xa0He is also keen on dispelling the notion\xa0that\xa0Geylang is known\xa0mostly for\xa0the red-light-district.""First thing when you mention Geylang, people will say, ‘Oh Geylang the red-light-district!’ But no! The red-light district is only just a small portion of it,” he said.\nCurrently, the visitors to his store include interest groups, those passionate about arts and culture, researchers, students, professors, photographers and videographers. There have even been tourists who travelled to Singapore just to visit his shop, he said.\xa0\n“It becomes a happy feeling when people come in – whether you are buying or not buying – but you (discover) something. Not necessarily through my products, but even through the old documents.”\nAsked about\xa0the oldest items he owns, Jeffrey drew out documents dating back to the 1930s. These include entry permits, title deeds of the shop, and agreements\xa0etched on delicate pieces of rice paper - all lovingly preserved by him. And they aren’t for sale.\xa0\n“Some collectors, they know what I have and they come back to me. They offer me a very good price (but) I still hang on,” he said. “All the documents, the letters, all these things. It’s a family thing ... I just want to hold on to my grandfather’s name.”\nHe added: “Geylang is about memories … People like me who still remember things must come out and share and tell people these are the authentic things.”\nGEYLANG SERAI MARKET: NEW FACES, OLD KAMPUNG SPIRIT\nGeylang Serai Market is not new to many Singaporeans, but have you wondered what it means? Serai is actually the Malay word for lemongrass - a smell that was once ubiquitous\xa0in the area in the 1840s because it was a cash crop for the Malays who settled there. A lemongrass factory named Kilang Serai\xa0eventually gave rise to the name Geylang Serai, according to Roots.gov.sg.\nWe braved the buzzing market days\xa0before the start of Ramadan, and amid\xa0the sea of faces, a few stall owners stood\xa0out for their relative youth among the more seasoned fishmongers, butchers and other hawkers.\xa0\nIt appears a new generation is preparing to take over from their parents’ businesses at the market, prompted\xa0in part by COVID-19 and other circumstances.\xa0\nTake for example Alfred Goh, who’s playing a bigger role in his family’s seafood business these days. The 32-year-old, who now helps out at the stall while being a debates coach,\xa0recalled how fresh seafood was being thrown away\xa0daily - sometimes up to 100kg - during the lockdown period because people weren’t buying.\xa0\n“This is quite a significant financial loss and also it’s a waste of food, so that was very upsetting for me. So what I did was I took a photo and posted it on Facebook and shared it among my social circle (saying) this is the situation … we are throwing away shellfish; if anybody wants shellfish I can arrange,” said Alfred.\n“Overnight the post was shared thousands of times. It went viral; I was getting hundreds of messages because it was getting shared,” he added.\nThis prompted him to rethink how the business is run and the setting up of Guang’s Fresh Mart online. But despite the online presence, the offline marketplace remains special to Alfred.\xa0\n“Whatever is left of the kampung spirit survived in this marketplace. Everyone is friendly … (and) there is a real sense of solidarity,” he said, pointing out that while there will be friendly rivalry, the stallowners would rally to help one another when in trouble.\xa0\xa0\nAlfred added: “It feels like home and I feel that’s part of the reason a lot of these stallholders, even in their 60s and 70s, they still go to the market … it’s a sense of community that you cannot get elsewhere.”\nMohamed Shahid Mohamed Yusoff would tell a similar tale.\xa0\nLast year’s circuit breaker restrictions meant he had to start an online business from scratch for his father’s stall Haji Abu Bakar Fresh and Frozen Meat Supplier.\n“During the circuit breaker, I just took a picture from my stall and I created a post on Facebook saying: ‘Okay, if you want your meat delivered to your house, we provide this service\',"" the 32-year-old said.\n“That night I received a thousand WhatsApp messages (with) people asking from all over the place whether I can supply to them.”\nSince then, he has kept busy introducing innovations like digital payment options to make sure the business - which has lasted decades since its early days at Tekka Market - remains relevant to a new generation of customers.\nAnother young hawker, Muhammad Taufiq Anwardeen, is also confident of Geylang Serai Market\'s future prospects.\nIn fact, the former cybersecurity analyst at Citibank believes that Singapore’s hawker culture getting on UNESCO’s intangible cultural heritage list last December is a shot in the arm for the market’s future.\xa0\nThe 34-year-old vegetable and dried goods seller, who took over the stall after his father suffered a heart attack, said: “I know I can pass (this stall) to my grandchild or son. It will be there forever and protected and that alone convinced me to stay there. I won’t move out anywhere (else and) keep this business growing.”\nCELEBRITI’S CORNER: A ROJAK OF GOOD FOOD AND FUN\nYou can hear Celebriti’s Corner - the rojak stall run by Singaporean comedian, singer and actor Roslan Shah - before you see it.\xa0\nIt’s no wonder as the boisterous Roslan can be heard yelling out orders for his rojak and entertaining his customers with jokes, making his stall hard to miss despite it being in a small restaurant called Al-Nour Kitchen at the junction between Lorong 101 Changi and Changi Road.\nThe multi-hyphenate, affectionately known as Cik Lan, returned to Singapore from Malaysia shortly before his mother’s passing in December 2019. But with the COVID-19 pandemic shutting borders, he found it hard to return to Malaysia in early 2020.\nStuck in Singapore, that’s when the 50-year-old\xa0decided to pivot from the entertainment sector to the food and beverage scene. “We cannot approach the Government to support us every day to give money … so we must do something. We cannot keep asking money from the Government. We must do work to find the money ourselves,” he explained.\nArmed with his late mother’s rojak recipe - one boasting a thick and rich peanut sauce and a generous helping of fruits and vegetables - Roslan set up Celebriti’s Corner with the help of another local celeb Alias Kadir.\nIt may just have three items on the menu, but the stall has been a hit with his fans. Other local celebrities such as Aisyah Aziz, Suraya Hassan and Iskandar Ismail have also been known to patronise his stall.\nAnd his star power has also rubbed off on Al-Nour’s, with the owner Riskandar Roslan saying that Cik Lan’s Facebook Live video streams “really helps” its business.\xa0\n“(Roslan) is unique … He only sells three things but he pulls in a lot of customers. Every table definitely has one rojak or char kuay (fried dough sticks) or his specialty (Maznah Ke Tu, a dish named after\xa0a line in P Ramlee\'s movie),” Riskandar added.\nProof of his pull: In just the few minutes it took the CNA team\xa0to set up for this interview, more than 300 viewers were queuing to tune in to his Facebook Live stream as it was rare for him to give\xa0an English interview.\nRoslan attributes his popularity to his larger-than-life personality that looks to entertain, regardless of location.\xa0\n“I (am a) natural. I (don’t) follow other artistes. People don’t like me I don’t care, because I don’t ask them for money. I like to make people happy.\n“If you are very sad at home, very stressed, you come here, I can make you happy,” he said.\nDIM SUM AND DURIANS: GEYLANG’S SUPPER SCENE\nIt’s 11pm, and most eating places in Singapore would be closing up if they\'ve not already done so. This is not so in Geylang, however, as the night is still young and brightly\xa0lit food stalls are just gearing up to serve the supper-seeking hordes.\nOn Geylang Road, Tasvee Restaurant – a place frequently recommended by those we\xa0spoke to when there\xa0– serves up Indian food and remains open all night for those looking to get their fix of mee goreng (fried noodles) and roti prata (fried Indian flat bread).\nAlong the same road is Eminent Frog Porridge, a popular food haunt\xa0in the neighbourhood. It sells many dishes, but most commonly seen on customers’ tables are its\xa0sizzling claypot with frog’s legs accompanied with steaming porridge. (Beware the chili kick.)\nThe crowds can also be seen at Sims Avenue where 126 Dim Sum Wen Dao Shi is located. Even at 1am, when we\xa0visited the stall, the queue to enter was snaking.\xa0\nPatrons were willing to brave the cramped space and queues just to get their hands on the smorgasbord of dim sum ranging from siew mai and har gao to char siew bao.\xa0\nNo food run in Geylang is complete without a mention of its unofficial durian street beginning at Sims Avenue. With at least five such stalls lining the street, durian lovers can try different variations ranging from red prawn to D24.\xa0\nThe cheapest durians we\xa0found\xa0that day, after feasting on the fruit in the name of research,\xa0was S$5 a box, and it sure hit the spot.\nPerhaps durians are as good a representation of the neighbourhood as any, according to Yinzhou.\n“I think the charm is that Geylang, people always perceive it from one angle but actually when you look at the complexity, it’s a lot more,” he said.\n“Like durian … How would you describe the taste of durian? You’d struggle to describe it. Different durians have different taste, so Geylang is like durian.”\nNow it\'s your turn. We\'d like you to tell us what\'s Up\xa0Your\xa0Alley. What is it that makes your neighbourhood unique? What are the places visitors may not notice at first glance, but are a unique and intrinsic part of the estate you know and love?\nWrite to us at\xa0digitalnews [at] mediacorp.com.sg\xa0or message us on\xa0Instagram\xa0or\xa0Facebook. Tell us about some of your favourite spots or about a person who embodies the spirit of the area.\nWe look forward to hearing from you!\n', 'related_topics': ['     Travel ', '     food ', '     Geylang ', '     Trending ', '     Up Your Alley ']}"

      From kueh to keropok lekor: Yummy Hari Raya snacks you can order via Instagram
  </h1>, 'text': ""Almost everyone would agree that some of the best Hari Raya treats are to be found in homes, made by families with love that you can taste.\xa0\nMany of these businesses were born out of passion and purvey delights that are made from cherished family recipes which have been passed down from generation to generation.\n\n\nSnagging yourself a share of these alluring treats, however, requires quick fingers and good timing since they are mostly made in limited numbers. Best to order early.\nLEKOR LEGIT SG\nAmong the many things that have changed during the pandemic is the steady supply of lekor, that sausage-shaped fish cracker native to Terengganu, Malaysia.\n“Because of border restrictions, it’s been hard to find genuine lekor in Singapore,” said Sarah Afina Bte Razali. “Those you get at pasar malam tend to be doughy and don’t really taste of fish.”\n\n\nA post shared by FRESH FROZEN LEKOR ���� (@lekorlegitsg)\nWhen she got to know someone who sells “legit” lekor, as she calls it, she jumped at the chance to sell them herself. Together with her partner Rafiqul Islam Bin Sahari, they buy lekor from a gentleman who makes it with ingredients imported from Terengganu before processing and packing them to sell through their Instagram account.\n“Since we started a few weeks ago, it’s been selling like hot cakes,” said Sarah happily. Among their range is Terengganu-style Lekor Gulung, which are shaped like sausages but don’t puff up when cooked because there is more fish than flour in the mix, explained Sarah.\n\n\nA post shared by FRESH FROZEN LEKOR ���� (@lekorlegitsg)\nThere is also Kelantan-style Lekor Bulat, which are shaped like discs and ball-shaped lekor filled with mozzarella. The lekor, which come with a bottle of piquant dipping sauce, are sold frozen so customers can fry them up fresh before eating. Check out their Instagram page to order. \xa0\nTHE UNDERGROUND CHAI CO\nMohamed Ibrahim Aslam had always had a fascination for chai, so when the Circuit Breaker hit in April last year and his father was retrenched from his job as a QC technician, Aslam suggested they turn his passion into a home-based business.\n\n\nA post shared by The Underground Chai Co. (@theunderground.chaico)\nToday, the family sells traditionally made South Indian milk tea and masala chai, which Aslam blends, and classic Indian snacks like onion pakoda, chicken curry buns and murukku made by his mother Anisha Begum. The murukku have been particularly popular and are made according to Begum’s treasured family recipe which calls for less oil and less salt.\xa0\n\n\nA post shared by The Underground Chai Co. (@theunderground.chaico)\nAslam’s teas are deliciously wholesome, enriched with full cream milk rather than tinned condensed milk. In time, Aslam hopes to save enough money to set up a brick and mortar store where he can peddle his passion for teas and his mother’s snacks. Orders are available for weekends and can be made by filling in an order form on his Instagram page.\nANA’S KOOKIES\nThe Salleh family business began 10 years ago at Geylang Serai’s Ramadan bazaar. As the festive market’s popularity blossomed, so did its stalls’ rents. Three years ago, to circumvent the stratospheric overheads, the family took their business online, selling their cookies on Facebook and Instagram.\n\n\nA post shared by Ana's Kookies (@anaskookies)\nBesides cutting out rent, this meant that they could sell their wares on any given day instead of only during the festive season. Customers return time and again for the family’s traditional cookies such as kueh makmur and sugee biscuits made by 58-year-old matriarch Zainah.\n\n\nA post shared by Ana's Kookies (@anaskookies)\nMY KID’S CRAVINGS\nTwo Ramadans ago, Frirafizah Abdul Razak began baking her children’s favourite treats. She shared them with her neighbours who loved them so much that it encouraged her to start selling small batches of her bakes from home.\n\n\nA post shared by Baklava Rings / Tapak Kuda (@mykidscraving)\nWhen the pandemic hit last year, Frirafizah’s wedding decoration business took a hit, so she turned her attention to her fledgling baking business, which she named My Kid’s Cravings. Business has been so healthy that earlier this year, Frirafizah roped in her aunt Esadora Bte Jamil.\n\n\nA post shared by Baklava Rings / Tapak Kuda (@mykidscraving)\n“We live nearby to each other and together, we can offer more variety,” she said. Esadora makes cookies and roll cakes while Frirafizah makes a delightful kunafe, kek gula hangus, and popular baklava rings in flavours such as white chocolate Oreo and Nutella sea salt pistachio. DM Frirafizah on their Instagram page to order.\nHAWRAA\nLike many people, Nathasha Rahiman found herself with little to do during the Circuit Breaker last year. “I work as a moneychanger, so I literally could not work because it had to close,” she explained.\n\n\nA post shared by Hawraa.Sg (@hawraa.sg)\nWith nothing but time on her hands, she set about learning to make kueh from her grandmother whom she lives with. Last August, Nathasha began selling kueh kaswi and bakar lauk, and she hasn’t looked back since. Her repertoire has grown to include putri salat, lapis beras and kole-kole.\n“These are all made from my family recipes which my grandmother used to sell many years ago to make a living,” said Nathasha. Her customers have been so supportive that they’ve inspired her to create kueh platters for Ramadan which allow them to sample a selection each week. And for Hari Raya, Nathasha and her grandmother will be making talam keladi and Florentine cookies for sale. DM Nathasha on Hawraa’s Instagram page.\n\n\nA post shared by Hawraa.Sg (@hawraa.sg)\nBUNDA ANA’S KITCHEN 45\nBunda Ana’s Kitchen 45 is part of Project Cookoh, which was started during the Circuit Breaker to empower mothers from the Readable initiative to start home-based businesses.\n\n\nA post shared by Bunda_Ana_kitchen 45 (@bunda_ana_kitchen)\nAna dishes up wholesome, home-cooked Indonesian fare to meet the high school fees she has to pay for her children who are foreigners in Singapore’s school system. Her repertoire includes fragrant baked goods such as ondeh ondeh tarts, snow tarts and peanut cookies.\n\n\nA post shared by Bunda_Ana_kitchen 45 (@bunda_ana_kitchen)\nBut it is her nasi tumpeng, comprising yellow rice and the likes of sambal goreng, chicken rendang and serundeng, that makes for a hearty celebration dish that can be shared among five people.

      The Singaporean chef serving ‘high-class Hainanese chicken rice’ to Hong Kong diners
  </h1>, 'text': 'In a sign of the resilience of high-end dining in Hong Kong, not to mention the spending power of the city\'s wine-loving community, Batard in the increasingly fashionable Sai Ying Pun district has gone from strength to strength, despite launching in June 2020 at the height of the pandemic.\nThat\'s thanks to two Singaporeans, coincidentally both from Potong Pasir, who have made it the restaurant everybody wants to eat at. But you\'ll have to wait as tables are fully booked up three months ahead – no mean feat when the restaurant seats 40 at both lunch and dinner.\n\n\nChef Aven Lau is just 27 but brings with him a resume to make much older chefs envious.\xa0 As he sits next to Batard\'s owner, Randy See, surrounded by some of the finest wines available in Hong Kong – including a magnum of 1993 Domaine de la Romanee Conti Montrachet at a cool HK$888,000 (S$153,000) – he tells us about growing up in Singapore.\n""I started watching variety shows teaching people how to cook, mainly wok cooking. I went to study marketing at Temasek Polytechnic and had some free time after graduating, before National Service. So I did some part-time work in a cafe, making paninis and pastas, then worked in a Mexican taco bar.”\nIt was an unlikely start to a stellar career, but Lau decided to “get serious” after watching Gordon Ramsay on YouTube. First stop was Saveur on Purvis Street where he worked on “affordable French food” and learnt under chef Tyler Lai, himself a former sous chef for the French culinary legend Joel Robuchon.\n""I asked him what my next stop should be and he told me that Julien Royer was leaving Jaan and opening [a new restaurant] at the National Gallery. He introduced me to Julien, we spoke for an hour and I said I was very interested but had no real experience.\xa0\n""Normally you start in garde-manger (working generally with cold foods like salads and pates) but Julien started me on meat. I didn\'t know how to fillet fish or do a lamb rack so I\'d go buy a whole salmon and whole saddle of lamb in the market and take it home to practise. We ate salmon for weeks!”\nLau explained that Odette was characterised by precision: ""There was a whole new level of cleanliness. I realised how strict they were, even down to things like not wearing colourful socks! As a first introduction to real fine dining I was very lucky as people usually stay in one section but they\'d move me to another so I\'d end up doing every section: Hot, cold, pastry etc.""\nAfter two years, Lau told Royer that he wanted to do a placement, known as a stage. Given that Nordic cuisine was booming, he ended up at Danish restaurant Kadeau, which had one outlet in Copenhagen and another in Bornholm Island, a Danish island in the Baltic Sea.\nAfter eating in some of Copenhagen\'s finest restaurants, he caught sight of dishes by Chef Daniel Calvert (formerly) of Belon, a neo-Parisian restaurant in Hong Kong, on Instagram, including a stuffed Dover Sole.\n\n\nA post shared by Daniel Calvert (@chezcalvert)\n\n\n""I thought it was a very nice dish and slid into his DM on Instagram. The next week I bought a ticket and flew over to Hong Kong and started working there. I was there two years in total. Daniel taught me a lot and was very inspiring. He taught me the most out of every chef I\'ve worked for and was strict with everything. Everything had to be fresh, every day. He tasted everything, every day, even a salad dressing. He had so much control in the kitchen. Also he would get in earlier than you, is faster than you and ten times better than you!""\nHe explained that his dishes were very minimalist in their presentation. ""A pie is a pie and a sauce is a sauce. I don\'t have herbs and flowers in my plating because of him. I went with him to Per Se (a three-Michelin-starred New York institution under Thomas Keller) for a four-hands event.”\nLau was so wowed that he wanted to get a job at Per Se, but given visa challenges, he was eventually persuaded to stay in Hong Kong by Chef Edward Voon, who promised to ""teach him how to run a restaurant"". He spent 18 months at Voon\'s Le Pan, before his most recent move.\nSee explained: ""The stars were aligned! There\'s a mutual respect between Daniel Calvert and I, so I asked him to let me know if he could recommend someone. The food here is really wine-friendly, but it was important to align with what Aven wants to achieve – big plates that let him explore his creativity. I\'ve got a lot of respect for this young man.\n“For example his monkfish en croute is extremely wine-friendly. It\'s paired with a dark sauce but is a fish dish that is so good with Pinot Noir or a rich and aged Chardonnay.""\nBatard is the restaurant within the 7,000 sq ft space of The Fine Wine Experience, one of Hong Kong\'s leading wine retailers, awarded the prestigious\xa02020 Fine Wine Retailer of the Year Asia Award\xa0by\xa0The Drinks Business Magazine.\nLau\'s frequently-changing menu to support this wine bounty is proudly and unsurprisingly French, but is not without its regional influences.\nSee explained: ""Every wine lover I speak to likes roast chicken, it\'s a go-to and is evergreen. We can tweak the chicken a bit – the condiments, stuffing, preparation method.”\n\n\nChef Lau added that his latest iteration has already become a must-order and a big hit on Instagram – as well as a dish proudly celebrating his and See’s roots: ""I brine local chicken in salt and sugar. The brining, drying, air-drying, steaming and roasting takes almost three days from scratch. As Singlish as it sounds, it\'s high-class Hainanese chicken rice! We were averaging 25 chickens a day for takeaway, during lockdown.""\nIt\'s a fabulous dish and rightly popular, another example of perfect execution and technique supported by bags of flavour. At HK$790 (S$136) per bird, it was also great business at a very tough time for the industry.\nElsewhere on the menu there are brilliant pies, another legacy of Lau\'s time working under Calvert.\n""Daniel got me interested in pies, the technical part of it. I needed another Instagram-worthy dish that was perfect for wine! I was thinking of salmon en croute or fish pie, but then why not monkfish? It\'s so meaty as a fish.\n“What is the farce (the stuffing), the exact time in the oven, the lattice over the top? It includes langoustines and black trumpet mushrooms, spinach, so how thick should the puff pastry be? The whole idea was scary, I did at least nine tries, testing non-stop. It\'s always about improving, what can I add? There\'s a whole art to it. I just want to feed people – people have to leave happy, full and satisfied.""\nThat just about encapsulates why Lau\'s food has become such a hit in Hong Kong.\nIndeed, perhaps pies are more important than he lets on. I asked what his first dish would be the next time he\'s back in Singapore.\n""I\'ll have a curry puff – in the airport!”\n""I brine local chicken in salt and sugar. The brining, drying, air-drying, steaming and roasting takes almost three days from scratch. As Singlish as it sounds, it\'s high-class Hainanese chicken rice!” – Aven Lau\n', 'related_topics': ['     Singapore ', '     Chefs ', '     Restaurants ', '     Hong Kong ', '     food ', '     F&B ', '     Profiles ', '     Fine dining ']}"

      Who is the scion of Julie’s Biscuits, who wants to make the company bolder?
  </h1>, 'text': 'As a young boy growing up, Sai Tzy Horng remembers having a pantry that was always well-stocked with Julie’s biscuits.\n“The peanut butter biscuits are the ones that I remember very dearly,” he recalled. “They came in a very big tin, and I still remember its old school design, with a brownish photo and lots of peanut butter and coffee, or something like that.”\nAt the time, Sai, the youngest son of Su Chin Hock, founder of Malaysian biscuit manufacturing company Julie\'s Biscuits, lived in Singapore with his mother and older brother. Meanwhile, his father remained in Malaysia to take care of the business, travelling to Singapore fortnightly to visit the family.\n“I remember he would bring back lots of biscuit samples when he was trying out different flavours. He would offer them to us so he could get our feedback. We were the taste testers, and my brother and I really enjoyed biscuits growing up,” Sai reminisced. \xa0\nFast forward to today, and Sai now works alongside his parents as the brand director of the company. Though he did have to taste-test one too many biscuits as a boy, eventually joining the family fold was never expected of him. “It wasn’t like every Sunday breakfast, my mum and dad would ask ‘When are you going to take over the business?’ It was nothing like that,” the 39-year-old laughed.\xa0\n“When I was young, I remember clearly my ambitions were to set out on my own. My parents also made it very clear that they wanted my brother and I to be independent and to make inroads for ourselves,” he said.\n“I remember [that my dad] would bring back lots of biscuit samples when he was trying out different flavours. We were the taste testers, and my brother and I really enjoyed biscuits growing up.” –\xa0Sai Tzy Horng\nAN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY\nFor Sai, finding his own path in life entailed moving to Canada, where he studied to become an educational psychologist. “I was bullied in school, so I wanted to learn how to undo the cycle. But once I grew up, I realised that my perception of being a psychologist and what it’s like in reality is a completely different story,” he admitted.\nAfter completing his studies, Sai decided to stay on in Canada, where he spent a total of 12 years, in order to “experience a life outside of Asia”.\xa0\nIt was eventually a Skype call from his mother in 2012 that pulled him back to the family business.\nAt that point, Julie’s was in the initial stages of embarking on a rebranding process, and his mum needed help in writing a story about the company. “I know that it was intentional for her to rope me back in. She felt it was time for me to come back to the business,” Sai acknowledged.\nFollowing that call, Sai spent several years as a consultant to the company. But as the years went by, he eventually decided to move\xa0back to Asia in 2017 to be “more hands-on with the business”. He’s now based in Singapore.\nThough his journey back to the business wasn’t one he expected, in a way, it was one he was unintentionally prepared for.\n“Though my father wasn’t around much, one way he used to bond with me was by talking about worldly affairs. He’s not the type to talk about my football match, or how I did for math. He’s the person who talks about business, world economics, and the political scene. From a very young age, he gave my brother and I a bird’s eye view of what it’s like to do business, and how you need to prepare for it by taking a look at the macro environment,” he shared.\nWhile Sai describes his role at Julie’s as a “hodge-podge” of many different things, he mainly oversees brand strategy and marketing. “We can do a lot of interesting things with the Julie’s brand. We can tell stories through our products, and outside of our products, so people can understand who we are and what we stand for,” he explained.\n“Though my father wasn’t around much, one way he used to bond with me was by talking about worldly affairs. From a very young age, he gave my brother and I a bird’s eye view of what it’s like to do business."" –\xa0Sai Tzy Horng\n\n\nJULIE COMES TO LIFE \nOnce he returned, one of Sai’s immediate priorities was to drive the company’s rebranding efforts. Although talk of rebranding Julie’s had begun as early as 2012, it was put on hold till 2017.\nSince the brand’s founding in 1984, Julie’s products have been instantly recognisable by the young, blonde girl depicted on the logo. Though the logo has become an icon today, many may still wonder, who exactly is Julie?\n“I’ve been asked this a thousand times,” Sai laughed. “People have asked, is Julie your mother? Your father’s ex-girlfriend? The real story is that Julie is someone my father made up. She’s not based on a real person, but the idea was to make the brand sound more international as he had set his sights on taking the brand outside of Asia.”\nFor 35 years, Julie wore a red vest, her hair tied up in pigtails. But last year, the company gave Julie a new look. She now sports a shorter haircut, with a spanking new outfit. She’s noticeably younger, with her face tilted to the side, looking up.\n\n\nA post shared by Julie\'s Biscuits (@juliesbiscuits)\n“There are many reasons for this,” Sai explained earnestly. “We wanted the brand to be more hopeful. With her head titled up, she looks a little bit cheeky, as though she’s looking for an adventure. That’s a reminder to us as a company to be more forward-looking and aspirational.”\nA key focus of the rebranding, Sai shared, was to bring Julie to life. “I didn’t want her to be a stamp or a passport photo, where she’s just stuck onto our products,” he mused.\n“Before the rebranding, Julie’s was already universally loved. We had a place in people’s households and their hearts. When I came back, one of the things I wanted to do was to amplify that, to tell wonderful stories. I felt that the brand really needed to speak up. The fact that Julie’s is a girl, a human character, that gives her infinite potential to be more iconic, which is something I’ve set my sights on.”\n“People have asked, is Julie your mother? Your father’s ex-girlfriend? The real story is that Julie is someone my father made up. She’s not based on a real person."" –\xa0Sai Tzy Horng\n\n\nTHE NEXT CHAPTER\nThroughout its history, Julie’s has always been a “humble” and “conservative” brand, Sai said. Though this has helped the company in many ways, it was also a problem.\n“There are two types of humble. The first type is being so reserved, people can never get to know you. But there’s another type of humility where people can get to know you. Where they see the values you stand for, that you are putting people first,” he said.\nBack when Sai was still a consultant for the company, he started Julie’s social movement, titled The Best Of You, in 2014. The movement encouraged\xa0the public to submit their personal stories of people, things, or experiences that have brought out the best in them.\n“It was a CSR project that allowed us to give back to society. I brought a lot of my Canadian influences and my work as a psychologist into the movement. A lot of it was really about appreciative storytelling, asking people to talk about their lives and their struggles, and giving them a space to cherish their accomplishments,” Sai explained.\nBeyond giving the brand a platform to speak about causes it believes in, Sai also hopes to push the company to be bolder when it comes to product development.\n“A lot of our R&D has been focused on improving our existing products, like our peanut butter biscuits. These things take time to nurture over the years. The more consistent we make the peanut butter biscuits, the more it becomes a staple in your pantry,” he said.\nBut this meant that the company wasn’t innovating when it came\xa0to new products. “What we’d like to do now is to play around as a brand by trying new flavours. If they don’t work, that’s ok,” Sai said.\nThough they might not eventually be launched, Sai revealed that Julie’s is currently exploring exotic flavours such as mala and matcha. “Salt and pepper is also a flavour we’re considering, as well as health-conscious products such as vegetable biscuits.”\nTo do so, the company wants to take a leaf out of McDonalds’ book by launching limited edition products. “It’s a way for us to introduce new flavours to the market and to test its receptiveness. I think many companies have done this to great success. McDonald\'s Singapore is one of them,” he said.\n“What we’d like to do now is to play around as a brand by trying new flavours.\xa0Salt and pepper is a flavour we’re considering, as well as health-conscious products such as vegetable biscuits.” –\xa0Sai Tzy Horng\n\n\n‘I FIND IT HARD TO SEE MYSELF AS A LEADER’ \nIt is interesting to note how some of Julie’s humility has evidently trickled down to Sai. When asked about his thoughts on being a second generation leader and what he brings to the company, he responded by saying, “I find it hard to see myself as a leader, or as ‘second generation’. I just don’t think in those sorts of terms.”\nSai has never been one to celebrate his achievements. “It’s a very Asian tradition that stems from my parents. We celebrated nothing. There were no birthday parties, no reward for good grades. I’ve also learnt that after you do one thing, you move on to the next. I never went for any of my graduations. My Master’s degree? Skipped,” he said.\nSai also believes that the term “second generation leader” comes with too much pressure. “It’s like I’m answerable to the whole world, and I’m probably not ready for that kind of title,” he continued.\nWhat Sai believes he’s doing differently from the previous generation, however, is bringing a sense of fun into the business. “You will see this transformation in Julie’s, where we want to take more chances and be more creative. We can let our hair down and not take things too seriously,” he said.\nWhile he sometimes misses his days as an educational psychologist, he now finds joy in the dynamic nature of his work at Julie’s. “Julie’s is experiencing a very interesting time in history right now. The rebrand has been well-received and the energy is there for us to do much bigger things,” he said.\nHe may not feel like he’s ready for the title as “second generation leader”, but it’s exciting to see where he takes Julie’s to next.\n“Julie’s is experiencing a very interesting time in history right now. We want to take more chances and be more creative. We can let our hair down and not take things too seriously."" –\xa0Sai Tzy Horng\n', 'related_topics': ['     food ', '     F&B ', '     Malaysia ', '     Profiles ']}"

Dinner is priced at S$88 per adult and S$44 per child.\nTIGA ROTI\nPopular burger restaurant Three Buns recently started its halal-friendly option called Tiga Roti. This cloud kitchen is dishing out burgers made from halal-certified ingredients and without pork, lard or alcohol.\nBefore the sun sets, place your order through Oddle, Grab, Deliveroo or Foodpanda for lip-smacking offerings like Plug Three, an Argentinean beef burger with ketchup, smoked mayo, sharp cheddar and onion pickle in a toasted demi brioche bun. There’s also pulled beef brisket burger smothered in rendang gravy, pickled daikon chilli and coconut aioli called Hot 'Dang. Vegetarians can ask for Boi Ndoot featuring a patty made from Tindle “chicken”, miso garlic parsley butter and truffle aioli.\nIFTAR BUFFET POP-UP AT HILTON SINGAPORE\nThe evening meal comes with a spread of over 30 dishes and breathtaking views of the city from Hilton Singapore’s 24th storey.

To finish, the pies get a generous handful of crispy ikan bilis and peanuts.\nAvailable from Apr 15 to Jun 15, the nasi lemak pizzas are available as part of various sets that come with a bottle of Fanta Coco Pandan, a new soda launch from Coca Cola for Hari Raya 2021, flavoured with coconut syrup and pandan juice.\nRAMADAN A LA CARTE BUFFET AT CAROUSEL\nThis popular Ramadan dining destination is going local this year with quintessential favourites such as rojak, gado gado, mutton and chicken satay, and traditional Nyonya kueh-kueh.\xa0\nWith over 100 dishes from the a la carte buffet menu, the most difficult decisions would be to choose between nasi ambeng (with beef rendang, deep-fried turmeric chicken and the works) or lobster mee soto; chendol or durian chocolate fudge? Use the promo code EB25 for a 25 per cent discount.\nLOCAL DELIGHTS BUFFET AT GINGER\nThe buffet line-up at Ginger gets a new slew of Malay and Indonesian delights for the month of April.

Well-loved Haig Road Putu Piring is also part of the daily spread.\nSTEAK BOWL CONGEE FROM PICANHAS\nHalal steakhouse Picanhas has created a satisfying bowl of congee just for Ramadan. Like the popular Picanhas Don (rice bowl) that it's\xa0fashioned after, the congee or rice porridge is served topped with a 200gm hunk of juicy steak, spring onions and a runny egg for good measure. Priced at S$27, it is available for free islandwide delivery till May 12.\nRAMADAN SPECIALS AT SAMA SAMA\nSama Sama means “you’re welcome” in Bahasa Indonesia and it is in that spirit that the restaurant has created its Ramadan specials. At S$32 per head (with a minimum of four people per order), the Ramadan set menu comprises a spread that begins with an appetiser of bakwan udang (a crisp prawn and vegetable fritter), along with six dishes that include sate kambing Betawi (Jakarta-style lamb skewers), gudeng Nangka (stewed jackfruit with hard-boiled egg and tofu), and semur Jawa daging (beef stew).\nDessert comes in the form of kolak pisang or bananas in coconut milk, Javanese palm sugar and pearl sago. There’s also the Ramadan Special lontong opor ayam ($15), served with ketupat basted in coconut milk and topped with the spiced chicken curry, boiled eggs and a side of Javanese stir-fried sambal goreng kentang with chicken hearts, gizzards and spicy potatoes.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     dining ', '     food ', '     Ramadan ', '     Restaurants ']}"

      Which new Japanese dining hotspot in Singapore is booked out until August?
  </h1>, 'text': 'If you had tried to make a reservation at private dining establishment The Orientalist House just a fortnight ago, the books would have been wide open. Pick a date, any date, and odds are, you would have scored yourself a place at its long, narrow table for eight.\nThat’s no longer the case now that new chef-in-residence Reiko Yoshikawa has moved in and shaped up the dining experience with her charming brand of “homestyle” Japanese food.\n\n\nTo be clear, if when she says “homestyle”, she means\xa0what’s served in a mansion for food-obsessed nobility, then it is indeed plausible. However, I cannot imagine that food of her ilk is served in a regular Japanese home on a regular day.\nI’m sure if I asked any Japanese friend if they sometimes cook premium eels by grilling, steaming and grilling them again, or serve said fish as part of a donabe made from rice grains husked in small batches, the answer would be a hard no.\nThat’s exactly what Yoshikawa, a culinary consultant, instructor and certified sake sommelier served us one rainy evening last week. It was the heartiest dish among the slew of other delights such as gently torched kinmedai (splendid alfonsino) with a spritz of sudachi (Japanese lime) and yuzu salt specially chosen for its subtly damp quality.\nAlso part of the procession of unpretentious, elegant dishes was a lovely marinated pen shell grilled to meaty tenderness and served in a crisp sheet of nori to yield the most satisfying wrap.\nEspecially impressive were six-year-old scallops from Iwate, deftly grilled and anointed with a fat pat of Calpis fermented butter (no, the butter is not made from Calpis, but by the manufacturer itself) that tempered the rich umami of the scallop’s dashi-soy seasoning.\n\n\nNo doubt, picking scallops that are precisely six years old is hardly a home-cook move, but before relocating to Singapore, Yoshikawa was also a guide at Tokyo’s Tsukiji and Toyosu markets.\nThough now based here, she continues to maintain long-distance relationships with suppliers (she jokingly refers to them as her boyfriends), whom she speaks to on the phone every Monday to pick produce for her meals. This gives her the advantage of importing unique items such as prized Satonishiki cherries and eels from Aichi prefecture.\nSeafood aside, another rare delight she served was velvety yuba (bean curd skin) sourced from one of the last remaining yuba houses in Tokyo with a centuries-old history.\nOnce a luxury for samurai and nobility, she explained, the yuba here is served wrapped around minced prawns seasoned with kewpie (Japanese mayo, perhaps the most homestyle element of the meal) and fried so that it ate like an incredibly tasty and delicate ngoh hiang. Served alongside this ambrosial nugget was a sliver of the uncooked yuba accompanied by the barest dab of wasabi to accentuate its ethereal flavour.\nWith menus priced at S$138 and S$198, Yoshikawa’s dinners are incredible value for money in a city where fine Japanese meals start northwards of S$250 for dinner. Thanks to the power of social media, response to Yoshikawa’s dinners at The Orientalist House have been “so overwhelming” that the establishment has stopped taking reservations.\n“I’ve never seen anything like this in the history of my career,” said The Orientalist House owner and industry veteran Michel Lu. “Within 48 hours last week, we were booked out till August.”\nLu said the plan is to release dates for August sometime in June.\n“Because Reiko is doing most of the cooking herself, we are still exploring the best way to accept reservations while ensuring that she has time to rest and take breaks in between.”\nYour best bet for a reservation then: Register to be notified when new dates are released on the establishment’s website.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Singapore ', '     F&B ', '     food ', '     dining ', '     Fine dining ']}"

      From caviar to Cabernet, luxury ingredients from China are now taking centre stage
  </h1>, 'text': 'Look back a couple of decades across Asia\'s fine dining scene and you would invariably have found luxury Japanese ingredients across menus, whether plump scallops and king crab from the cold waters of Hokkaido or buttery beef from Kobe. But native Chinese ingredients? Much, much harder to spot.\nFast forward 20 years, however, and premium ingredients and wines from China have increasingly earned pride of place in fine dining restaurants across the continent.\nFew ingredients scream luxury as much as caviar, so diners are frequently surprised to learn that many of the black pearls spooned into quenelles or added to decadent sauces come from Thousand Island Lake, 400km southwest of Shanghai. But chefs across Asia and around the world – including in more than 80 per cent of Paris\' three-Michelin-starred restaurants – proudly serve Kaluga Queen.\nThey\'re by far the largest Chinese producer at more than 85 tonnes a year, but at the new Modern European restaurant Sommer in Marina Bay, the brand of choice is Kairos Caviar. The caviar is farmed in an ecological breeding base on the Yunnan-Tibet Plateau and allows for head chef Lewis Barker to select the very best for his diners.\n""I get to handpick and reserve the best quality caviar from each batch and choose sturgeons that are aged at least 12 years before the roe is harvested, producing a more refined and complex caviar,” he said. “It is responsibly and sustainably farmed in a pristine environment which, combined with carefully optimised harvesting, leads to a truly premium quality.""\nHe serves it atop dishes such as scallops with buttermilk and Granny Smith apple, or with oyster and green chill ponzu from his Experience menu. As to whether he thinks that produce from Mainland China still has an image problem in the views of global diners, Barker couldn\'t be clearer.\n“‘Made-in-China\' is no longer something to avoid. Especially in the last few years, China has become very stringent with its food exports, due in part to increased spending power and demand\xa0for higher standards.”\n‘WE ARE CLOSER TO YUNNAN THAN TO EUROPE’\nIn Hong Kong, Argentinian chef Agustin Balbi continues to win plaudits – including a first Michelin star this January – for his sublime tasting menu dishes at Ando which celebrate flavours and techniques from his homeland and also Japan, where he lived for six years. The 32-year-old has always embraced the finest global produce, and ingredients from China are no exception.\n""Ando is about telling my journey and memories through food. I\'ve been in Hong Kong a few years so this place has become part of my journey and now I feel more confident in easing more Chinese ingredients into my cooking. Right now we use morels and cordyceps from Yunnan and also snow lotus with pickled chilli from Xinjiang.""\nThe fragrance and intense flavour of the mushrooms truly sing in two dishes, the first called Medio Mundo where he cooks them with butter, thyme and a touch of salt to draw out the natural aromas, served as a puree with suzuki fish, fresh green peas, and shiso.\n""Yunnan possesses an enormous number of edible species – the depth of mushroom variety is mesmerising. For me it is also a matter of location: We are closer to Yunnan than to Europe so the produce will arrive fresher, with better aroma and more intense flavours. Plus the quality is very, very high,” said Balbi.\nThen, in Una y otra vez, he simmers daikon in ham broth that is infused with Yunnan cordyceps to give texture, colour and deep umami flavour, before garnishing it with 80-month aged Joselito ham and crispy battered kombu. It\'s clearly a winner with diners.\n""This has been one of the favourites, people reacted very well and we took all the steps to make sure we use it in the most respectful way because it is not just an ingredient, but also part of a culture. To me, there is an immense world out there to explore, and a huge amount of ingredients to discover in Mainland China. I can\'t wait to find more very special ingredients that will increase our repertoire.”\nAnother Chinese ingredient making waves across cuisines is dry-cured Jinhua ham\xa0from Zhejiang Province. An eight-year aged ham features in dishes at Hong Kong\'s China Tang Landmark from executive chef Menex Cheung. With famed hams like acorn-fed bellota from Spain already popular, he explains how Jinhua compares.\n""The colour of Jinhua ham is much lighter than Iberico ham and the fat is more concentrated. Jinhua hams are mainly cooked, as the aroma and umami are fully evoked after heating. The longer the simmering time, the smoother the aroma and taste will be. Therefore we picked Jinhua ham to make the broth of the dish Double-boiled Snow Goose, Fish Maw, Spring Bamboo Shoot in our new spring menu.""\nJinhua ham is hardly a new ingredient, having already won international culinary prizes more than a century ago, but its high price comes from a labour-intensive production process – and rare animals.\n""Jinhua and Xuanwei are two major ham-producing areas in China, but Jinhua ham is especially valuable because of the rare pigs, complex process and long dry-cure time. Jinhua people have a long tradition of raising ‘two-end-black’ pigs, named for their black heads and tails. Generally, the ham tastes better for three\xa0to four years old, and even more elegant after five to 10 years, just like wine.""\nCheung also puts the rise of native Chinese ingredients into interesting context, having worked in the Mainland for a decade, where he saw the quality and variety of ingredients rapidly improve.\n""We understand people may be concerned about the quality of China produce, but with the growth of Chinese society and their demand for the quality of life, the monitoring system of raw materials has been greatly improved these past few years.”\n“‘Made-in-China\' is no longer something to avoid. Especially in the last few years, China has become very stringent with its food exports, due in part to increased spending power and demand\xa0for higher standards.” – Lewis Barker\nGRAND CRU OF THE HIMALAYAS\nFinally to the world of wine where Ao Yun, the first “Grand Cru of The Himalayas”, has placed Yunnan firmly on the global winemaking map.\nGrapes are picked at an elevation of 2,600m around four villages of the upper Mekong Valley and for the 2017 vintage – which releases this year – the last were plucked on Nov 22, 2020, breaking the record for the latest harvest day for a red wine in the northern hemisphere.\nThe final blend for the 2017 features 72 per cent Cabernet Sauvignon, 19 per cent Cabernet Franc, 4 per cent Syrah, 3 per cent Petit Verdot and 2 per cent Merlot.\nAo Yun\'s estate & technical director, Maxence Dulou, an award-winning winemaker from Bordeaux, explained: “We managed to harvest powerful but ripe grapes and transform them into a concentrated but fresh and velvety wine. This vintage symbolises the enhancement through a challenging climate compensated by great adaptation in the vineyard and in our winemaking.""\nAt a store retail price of around S$390 per bottle, the price of the 2017 vintage equates to heavy-hitting Burgundies, but as Hong Kong-based Master of Wine Jennifer Doherty explained: ""Chinese luxury wineries such as Ao Yun, now joined by Domaine de Long Dai, have highlighted to the world China’s potential for creating luxury wines which can be a point of pride for Chinese diners. Their small production makes them not readily available, adding to their allure.""\nSo with an enormous and seemingly insatiable domestic market – as well as a burgeoning global appetite – it\'s clear that luxury Chinese ingredients are here to stay.\n“To me, there is an immense world out there to explore, and a huge amount of ingredients to discover in Mainland China. I can\'t wait to find more very special ingredients that will increase our repertoire.” – Agustin Balbi\n', 'related_topics': ['     China ', '     luxury ', '     food ', '     F&B ', '     Singapore ', '     Hong Kong ', '     Asia ', '     Fine dining ']}"

      ‘I’ve crossed over to the Dark Side’: David Thompson on his new Bangkok venture
  </h1>, 'text': 'David Thompson appeared tableside to serve us a suspiciously Gallic-tinged duck dish. “I’ve become a traitor to myself,” he deadpanned.\nWe are at Aksorn, the renowned Australian chef’s first venture in Bangkok following his departure from Nahm, where he was widely credited for redefining the parameters of Thai fine dining.\nAt first glance, Thompson’s latest baby bears many hallmarks guests have come to expect from his restaurants.\nCooks pound piquant pastes in mortar and pestles and prep plates replete with no-compromise Thai flavours to be served – family-style for the most part – to diners.\nThe dishes are drawn from vintage Thai cookbooks, reflecting the literary-minded Thompson’s well-known penchant for mining arcane native source material for inspiration.\nCompleting the Thompson-esque feel of the place is the presence of the chef himself as he patrols the open kitchen to ensure things are running smoothly.\nYet these familiarities disguise a radical shift for a chef who freely admits to puritanism worthy of the most devout Thai food fundamentalist.\nAksorn, you see, is inspired not by a barely remembered past of venerated cooking traditions and mysterious recipes passed down through the generations. Instead, it brings Thailand’s culinary story more up to date, with Thompson homing in on cookbooks published between the 1950s and the 1970s.\n“It\'s allowed me to open up some pages on Thai cuisine that I\'ve never done before and I\'ve encountered some delicious surprises,” he said.\nThe concept of the restaurant is informed by its role as a headline draw at Central: The Original Store, which is a recently unveiled celebration of the Central Group retail empire, one of Thailand\'s biggest entrepreneurial success stories.\n\n\nFOREIGN FLAVOURS\nLocated on the site of the company’s first retail store, which opened in 1950, the store is a homage to the post-WWII era: A period where Thailand was increasingly soaking in influences from the rest of the world.\nJust as foreign architecture, fashion and cultural imports such as jazz and rock ’n\' roll made their mark in Thailand, so too did Western food. Affluent Thai households would showcase the sophistication of their table by serving foreign dishes: Often just as a canape. Cookbooks from this era reflect this appetite for cross-pollination to an extent that even Thompson was surprised by.\n“There was more foreign influence than I expected,” he said, referring to the duck dish he brought us earlier as a prime example. “It’s from a book written by a lady called Thanphuying Kleeb Mahidhorn. She was the wife of a high-ranking courtier and raised in the inner court of the royal palace.\n“French was one of the main languages of diplomacy when she was there, so you\'d have all these French cooks coming in to make food for these grand diplomatic banquets. In the book, she has all her family\'s favourite recipes including this one for the duck. She calls it ped nung (steamed duck), but in reality, it is a galantine. It’s as French as a baguette.\n\n\nA post shared by Aksorn (@aksornbkk)\n\n\n“I’d always censored these foreign incursions into Thai cooking with the rigour of somebody who can\'t accept it. For me (this outward-looking philosophy) is heresy as I\'ve always been a purist. Previously I disdained such things with the keenness of a convert. I’ve been orthodox. But although I’m finding travesty in some of these recipes, it\'s a travesty that I can swallow. And there\'s nothing as delicious as a bit of sin.”\nIf Thompson has tempered his culinary fundamentalism at Aksorn, it seems indicative of an overall mellowing. It\'s a state of mind helped, not hindered, by the current extraordinary global situation.\nLike restaurateurs everywhere, he is keenly aware of the impact the pandemic has had on the F&B industry. His empire – one that currently spans Hong Kong, Sydney, Melbourne, and Perth, along with two additional venues in Koh Samui and Krabi in Thailand – has felt the heat from temporary closures, restrictions, and social distancing measures.\nProfessional setbacks aside, Thompson has managed to glean positives from the ongoing global health crisis. He led a jet-setting – “discombobulating” – existence pre-pandemic, shuttling between his Bangkok base to nurture his various interests. With international travel all but closed for the moment, the chef is savouring the opportunity to stand still.\n“COVID-19 has contained me, and I\'m delighted by that,"" he said. ""I was so disenchanted with travel. I was travelling three weeks out of five, looking after all the restaurants abroad and developing other restaurants. I was exhausted: And enervated too. I was delighted to stop travelling. And I still am. It\'s the longest I\'ve stayed in one country for 30 years – if not longer. It’s more fruitful to be in Thailand than anywhere else. While I can’t travel, I have no wish to travel. I like it here. I don\'t feel confined here.”\n\n\nBANGKOK LOVE STORY\nIt helps that Thailand remains a place after Thompson\'s heart.\nThe chef began his first extended stint in Bangkok in 1988 and has since become inexorably linked with the international image of Thai cuisine. Thompson is quick to wax lyrical about Bangkok\'s incredible food scene.\n""It inspires me daily,"" he said. He\'s also effusive about the local heroes – both storied and unsung – who have helped make the city a culinary behemoth. Nevertheless, his role in helping to evolve Thai dining culture cannot be understated.\nThe first iteration of Nahm at the Halkin Hotel in London became, in 2001, the first Thai restaurant to gain a Michelin star. A second branch, in Bangkok, opened in 2010. It became, under Thompson, a yardstick for Thai fine dining in the country\'s capital. He left Nahm in 2018 to focus on his other projects as well as food group Aylmer Aaharn, which he co-founded to protect the history and legacy of Thai food.\nNahm’s gilded reputation precedes Thompson, but anyone expecting a straight-up rebooting of former glories at Aksorn will be wrong-footed.\nDishes like a steamed curry of pork with peanuts and Thai basil and smoked fish soup with shredded chicken, bamboo and Thai herbs are intensely flavoured and exquisitely layered texturally: A testament to Thompson\'s skill. The chef, though, is happy to give the long-forgotten cookbook authors of post-war Thailand kudos for providing his source material.\n“I’m trying to be a culinary chameleon here,” he said. ""It\'s not about me, it\'s about presenting what is in the book. In some ways, it is against everything I\'ve ever done before. The galantine is not the only bastardised dish in these books. I\'ve done a pork terrine, there\'s glace pineapple with young coconut meat. It\'s a lot of fun. Constricting and freeing at the same time.""\nBefore he bids us farewell on the ground floor of Central: The Original Store, Thompson\xa0has a browse through some of the vintage magazines on display. Editions of Life, Vogue and Harpers Bazaar exude a technicolour glow, their glossy depictions of Americana as seductive today as they must have been to Thai readers in the 1950s.\nIt’s little wonder that even a food culture as robust as Thailand’s couldn’t help but be permeated by the West. But even the new, loosened-up Thompson has his limits.\n“I don’t think I can bring myself to put a hot dog on,” he joked. “But if it was in one of the cookbooks, I might do one as a kind of ‘screw-you canape’. Why not? I’ve already crossed over to the dark side.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     Bangkok ', '     Thailand ', '     Chefs ', '     food ', '     F&B ', '     Restaurants ', '     Profiles ', '     Fine dining ']}"

      Omakase restaurants in Singapore: The next best thing to being in Japan right now
  </h1>, 'text': 'Anecdotal evidence (read: Conversations with friends) suggests that Japan remains the travel destination Singaporeans miss most. Some say it’s the crisp spring weather that nudges the\xa0sakura\xa0into bloom at this time of year; others miss the powdery ski slopes and onsen.\n\n\nMost, however, just pine for the food. In particular, we love our sushi omakase, and we love that sushi omakase in Japan doesn’t cost the king’s ransom that it does here (the average dinner cheque at a fine sushi-ya in Singapore runs upwards of S$250 before drinks, taxes and surcharges).\nBut hey, home is where the money is right now so it’s no surprise that the cash we’re saving from not travelling is instead dispatched to upscale restaurants. This might explain the sheer difficulty of getting a seat at some of the best Japanese joints in town.\nAt Kisho, for instance, where lunch will set you back at least S$250 before tax, reservations open at 10am on the first day of each month and get snapped up within minutes. The popular Hashida Singapore is booked up past April, save for a few odd seats here and there, said a spokesperson for the restaurant. Meanwhile, kappo restaurant Takayama advises that reservations be made three to four months in advance.\nWord on the street is that there is a flurry of activity in Singapore’s sushi world. The venerated (by well-heeled foodies, anyway) Sushi Kou is said to have plans to open two new outlets, while there are whispers of sushi chefs from big-name establishments set to leave and open restaurants of their own.\nIt’s just as well because Singaporean diners just can’t seem to get enough. New Japanese establishments are sprouting across town quicker than you can say “irasshaimase”, while time-honoured ones labour to keep things fresh.\n\n\nTRANSPORTIVE EXPERIENCES\nNewcomer Fukui, which soft-launched in late January, reports strong bookings till June. Sprawled across the first floor of a rambling shophouse along Mohamed Sultan Road, the restaurant is headed by Malaysian chef Nick Pa’an who cut his teeth under chef Santaro Li at his eponymous outfit in Amara Singapore.\nWith long hallways, dark wood wainscotting, a sushi counter that seats 12, as well as several private dining rooms, Fukui’s interiors reflect Pa’an’s delicately modern approach to Japanese food. Shore-fresh sashimi, for instance, is anointed with the likes of kimizu (a sauce made of egg yolk and rice vinegar) or truffle and ponzu dressing.\nIts founders, sisters Eugenia and Emilia Tan, named the restaurant after the Japanese prefecture that was next on their travel list before the pandemic hit. They’ve long been fans of Fukui’s sake, which now forms the backbone of their restaurant’s drinks list.\nDINNER AND A SHOW\nThe well-regarded Kappo Shunsui recently moved out of its Cuppage Centre space and reopened in a new guise at Hongkong Street where head chef Shimuta Kunihiko brings his own brand of dinner theatre in a dark, cavernous space.\nIn showbiz style, each night’s single seating for 13 diners begins at 7pm when Kunihiko serves a welcome drink of Kid Junmai Daiginjo Sparkling in a champagne glass with a bubble of orange smoke perched on its rim.\nThis novel presentation sets the tone for the rest of the evening during which the chef works on an island stage with cameras strategically placed to capture his knife and sushi skills. These are projected on a pair of digital screens behind him.\nThe theatrics mount as dinner progresses. There is a smouldering rod of coal pressed onto slabs of raw fish, a marbled hunk of A5 Miyazaki beef set on fire, and ice cream made a la minute above a bowl of liquid nitrogen. Thankfully, the drama belies well-crafted dishes using fine seasonal produce served on pilfer-worthy antique tableware.\nAND MORE…\nAlong the next street, stalwart Shinzo Japanese Cuisine constantly updates its offerings according to the seasons.\nIts current Spring menu begins with the likes of shirako ponzu (cod milt served in citrus soy dressing) and monkfish liver in miso soup. Nuggets of hand-formed sushi featuring immensely tasty shari (seasoned rice) follow, before the likes of seared A5 wagyu and perfectly steamed abalone.\nFun fact: Shinzo’s chefs Patrick Tan and Kevin Ho trained under acclaimed chef Yoshio Nogawa who introduced sushi to Singapore at his Sushi Kaiseki Nogawa when it opened in 1978.\nIf you can swing a reservation, the newly minted Masaaki at South Beach Avenue is worth a gander. Amid a dining room clad in dusky pink Gucci wallpaper and a counter made from 250-year-old hinoki wood, chef Masaaki Sakashita – late of Ishi and Hashida Sushi – dishes out elaborate sashimi platters, exquisite morsels of sushi and well-crafted dishes such as steamed blackthroat sea perch with grated white turnip.\nFinally, the latest entrant isn’t a restaurant but a private dining space set in a Geylang shophouse. Owner and entrepreneur Michel Lu recently brought in Japanese culinary consultant and cooking school director Reiko Yoshikawa as The Orientalist House’s chef-in-residence.\nYoshikawa wows with nine-course omakase dinners featuring produce from her direct contacts at Tokyo’s Tsukiji and Toyosu markets. These include premium unagi from Aichi prefecture which she grills, steams and grills again for optimum flavour and texture. At S$138 for a soul-satisfying dinner, this hidden gem is unlikely to stay hidden for very long.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Singapore ', '     Japan ', '     food ', '     F&B ', '     gastronomy ', '     Restaurants ', '     Fine dining ']}"

      Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants winner: 'This tells us we can be proud of (Chinese) cuisine'
  </h1>, 'text': 'Taking top honours at the Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants 2021 awards ceremony last night was a pleasant surprise for The Chairman’s owner Danny Yip. That’s because for most of 2020, his restaurant in Hong Kong’s Central district was either closed or half-open.\xa0\nCOVID-19 restrictions in Hong Kong mandated a two-month islandwide lockdown and that restaurants open only for lunch for three months after.\n“But we always look on the good side of life,” the visibly thrilled Yip told CNA Luxury\xa0on Friday (Mar 26) morning. “We opened from 12pm to 6pm without a break in-between… and this was the first time I saw so many people dine-in for full courses at 4pm! We had full-houses in the middle of the afternoon.”\n\n\nA post shared by 大班樓 The Chairman Restaurant HK (@thechairmanrestauranthk)\nThe upside of the pandemic was that it forced Yip and his team to stay focused on cooking. “No more travelling, no more four hands. We had all hands in the kitchen,” he quipped. “We are chefs, we’re supposed to be in the kitchen anyway. So we spent a lot of time pouring our resources into fine-tuning our dishes and creating new dishes. That was the good part of last year.”\nThat may have just been what earned The Chairman its top ranking, and Yip agrees: “Last year, we had double the number of new dishes on our menu. We’d never had the chance to put so much energy into cooking. So we learned one thing: Always stay focused. It’s the key to being a good chef.”\nWhen asked if he and his team expected the win, Yip responded with a laugh. “I mean, look at me. I haven’t slept all night! It was unreal; we didn’t expect any of this. We thought if we placed in the top 10, we would be very happy.\n“This is so encouraging, not just for us but for everyone who works in Chinese restaurants. If you ever doubt the cuisine or the global acceptance of the cuisine, you should not. This tells us we can be proud of the cuisine, so be creative, take the bold step and just go for it.

      There’s plenty more you don’t know about Singapore’s culinary heritage
  </h1>, 'text': 'The beef striploin sambal hijau tastes familiar. It is bright with the citrus notes of green chilli and mildly sweet from its shallot-enriched rempah (spice mix). There is the earthy grassiness of ground coriander and fennel warmed by the heat of those chillies cooked low and slow. It is not a dish any of us has had before, yet it bears a hauntingly soulful familiarity.\nSuch is how most of our meal at Restaurant Kin progresses. The dishes from chef Damian D’Silva’s latest menu are at once new and familiar; a mash-up of flavours we recognise and sometimes eat at home. It is, intrinsically, Singaporean family food – except from a family of a different time.\nAt 65, D’Silva’s standing as the “grandfather of Singapore heritage food” is well earned. Few others have embodied and advocated the merits of our multicultural cuisine as much as he has.\nPart-Peranakan, part-Eurasian and a child of the kampong era, D’Silva’s diverse experiences have given his dishes a colourful tapestry – Indian-inflected egg rolls, Indonesian-accented stews, Chinese stir-fries and Eurasian curries; these are all part of his personal foodways that zigzag across the valley of his childhood home in Opera Estate to the kampong of his father’s best friends, and the HDB flat in the eastern heartlands where he now resides. As ever, all this is represented in his new offerings at Kin. \xa0 \xa0\n\n\nAmong the updated repertoire is the Chinese hawker classic cuttlefish kang kong, a dish many of us know by its Hokkien name, ju her eng cai. Kin’s rendition is decidedly elegant with perfectly blanched cuttlefish and kang kong (water spinach), and a sweet dressing heady with hae ko (fermented prawn paste). Unique to D’Silva’s family is the addition of sunny wedges of honey pineapple that help cut through the dish’s richness.\nBy now, followers of D’Silva’s personal folklore are familiar with Aunty Zainab, the wife of his father’s best friend who introduced him to the allure of Malay and Indonesian cuisine. Plumbing memories of eating at her table, D’Silva has introduced ayam kalasan to Kin’s menu, a Malay-Indonesian fried chicken number that he’s updated with European cooking techniques.\nTo make said dish, D’Silva braises the “chicken Maryland” ever so gently in coconut water and aromatics before deep-frying it to a delightful crisp. Bite into the chicken and its crisp exterior yields to succulent, spoon-tender flesh.\nChicken Maryland, incidentally, reflects D’Silva’s late-colonial-era upbringing when the term referred to the cut of the bird that comprises the drumstick and thighs. Another element that makes this dish particularly good is the turmeric-scented sambal spiked with the concentrated spices of the chicken’s reduced marinade.\nAmong the greatest hits at our lunch is the nangka rendang, unripened jackfruit stewed in a nuanced coconut gravy suffused with no less than 15 spices. The resulting dish is hearty yet light, with a delicate complexity of flavours recognisable to any diaspora who shares history in Southeast Asian fare. \xa0 \xa0\nThe highest praise we save for the pork knuckle debal, a heavenly riff on the Eurasian festive staple thanks to the addition of a hunk of smoked pork knuckle braised to quivering tenderness. Lashings of vinegar and hot English mustard at the end of cooking imbues the dish with moreish acidity. Never mind that our guts are bursting at the seams, this is like Christmas and every occasion worth celebrating bundled into a single-bowl feast.\nIn other words, we don’t stop eating.\nLike the beef striploin sambal hijau, debal curry is a cherished dish that comes from D’Silva’s late grandfather’s extensive repertoire. And as “the rebel chef” (a self-styled moniker that D’Silva certainly lived up to in his younger days) mellows into his sexagenarian years, it has dawned on him that these recipes now date back at least a century.\nBy recapturing their essence and introducing them to a new generation, D’Silva inadvertently offers diners a taste of what we didn’t know we were missing.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Singapore ', '     food ', '     F&B ', '     Restaurants ', '     Chefs ', '     Fine dining ']}"

      Taiwan bursts with creative pineapple dishes after China ban
  </h1>, 'text': 'TAIPEI: Taiwan\'s classic beef noodle soup has taken on a sweet and sour twist.\nTaipei chef Hung Ching Lung created a pineapple beef noodle soup at his eponymous restaurant Chef Hung, in what he says is a modest attempt to support Taiwanese pineapple farmers.\nThe spiky fruit became a politically charged symbol after China banned the import of Taiwan\'s pineapples on Mar\xa01, citing pests.\nIn response, Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen kicked off a social media challenge called ""Eat Taiwan\'s pineapples until you burst"",\xa0calling on people to support the island\'s farmers.\nThe campaign has kicked off a pineapple media frenzy, as Taiwanese politicians sought to demonstrate their support for farmers as well as Taiwanese agriculture.\nPoliticians from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and the opposition Nationalist Party flocked to farms to post pictures with pineapples.\nRestaurateurs like Hung rushed to make pineapple-infused dishes. Pineapple shrimp balls, a betel nut pineapple salad and classics like fried rice with pineapple are just some of the dishes being pushed out by restaurants and hotels on the island.\nHung said he and his team spent three days testing ways to incorporate pineapple into beef noodles. It took about 10 attempts.\n""The first time we tested it when we cooked it in the soup, it was very sweet, it was inedible and tasted completely of pineapple,"" he said.\nThe successful attempt was based on separating the juice from the fruit during cooking, which removed the sweetness that would otherwise overpower the beef flavor.\nChina denies its move to ban Taiwanese pineapples was politically motivated, with a spokesperson for Beijing\'s Taiwan Affairs Office saying that the decision was a ""normal biosafety measure, and entirely reasonable and necessary"".\nTaiwan\'s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has called the move one that ""flies in the face of rules-based, free and fair trade"".\nChina has most recently leveraged its immense market in a trade war with Australia. It stopped or reduced imports of beef, coal, barley, seafood, sugar and timber from Australia after that country supported calls for a probe into the origin of the COVID-19\xa0pandemic, which is believed to have begun in China in late 2019.\nDespite the hubbub, the pineapple ban may not drastically impact Taiwanese farmers.\nA day after the ban was enacted, Taiwanese Premier Su Tseng-chang told local media that the amount purchased by domestic businesses and citizens exceeded the amount that would have been sold to China.\nThe government also promised subsidies worth NT$1 billion\xa0(US$35 million) to help out farmers.\nThe government said it has also received orders from Japan, Australia, Singapore, Vietnam and Middle Eastern countries.\nAnnually, Taiwan produces about 420,000 tonnes of pineapples, 90 per cent of which are sold on the island itself, according to the Council of Agriculture. About 10 per cent of that annual production is sold abroad, and China makes up the vast majority of those purchases.\nIt is unclear whether the recent surge in domestic orders and orders from foreign countries will make up for China\'s ban in the long run.\nBut in the short term, it has drawn patriotic feelings out of some local residents.\n""We are all trying to find a way to help the farmers,"" said Alice Tsai, who stopped in Hung\'s restaurant on Wednesday (Mar 10) to try noodles that she said were surprisingly tasty.\n""The other day I went to the supermarket and found that all the pineapples were sold out, and I felt very touched,"" she said.

      Meet the 31-year-old Frenchman who runs foodpanda in Singapore 
  </h1>, 'text': ""Thanks to the panda in its name and logo, you’d be forgiven for assuming that foodpanda is Asian-owned.\nIn actuality, the ubiquitous food delivery platform was founded in Singapore in 2012, but is now owned by Berlin-based Delivery Hero, which acquired the business in 2016. It is listed on the German DAX, following an IPO in 2017.\nSo, oddly enough, while the foodpanda brand remains most active in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) market, you would just as easily find its pink-garbed riders plying the streets of Romania and Bulgaria – the two Eastern European markets where the company has a presence – today.\nAnd at its helm is Frenchman Luc Andreani, who assumed the role of managing director of Singapore at the tender age of 27 – believed to be the youngest MD the company has ever seen.\nNow 31, Andreani is tasked with stewarding foodpanda through one of the most challenging economic eras the world has ever experienced. And with his “eclectic” background, Andreani just might be the best person to both steer foodpanda through the storm while capitalising on the exponential growth the delivery platform is experiencing during these uncertain times.\nBefore joining the tech industry, Andreani went from coordinating counter-trafficking operations with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime to working with the International Atomic Agency, which promotes the peaceful use of nuclear energy, and later to establishing diplomatic relations between the French and Chilean government with the French Embassy in Santiago, where he picked up Spanish.\n\n\n“Those were super cool experiences and you meet amazing, fascinating people and you’re exposed to things you only read in the news like negotiations on nuclear energy. But the reality is that those are environments in which age matters a lot and to get to a position of impact and power, you’d need to be of a certain age,” Andreani explained.\nWhile figuring out his next move, Andreani returned to Paris and juggled three jobs: Consulting work and political campaigning during the 2012 French presidential elections while also working\xa0for power company Electricite de France (EDF).\nArmed with his liberal arts degree focused on Asian studies (where he picked up Mandarin) and a master’s degree in corporate finance, strategy and entrepreneurship, Andreani eventually decided to move out to Asia to join Lazada Vietnam and Indonesia.\nThose were the exciting days of early tech and the start-up space was exactly where ambitious and dynamic young individuals with entrepreneurial appetites could perhaps make the greatest strides.\n\n\nAndreani flourished in that environment, climbing from category manager to senior vice president in just three years due to his ability to quickly understand the dynamics of complex markets in the burgeoning e-commerce segment – and harnessing that understanding to power the company’s growth.\nFour years ago, foodpanda scooped him up to head up its entire regional business and Andreani moved to Singapore with the intention of steadily growing the platform.\nThen 2020 changed the game.\nWhile most businesses were struggling to stay viable during the circuit breaker last April, delivery orders unsurprisingly doubled for foodpanda that month. Its entire Singapore business doubled again the following month, and has maintained close to that peak since. With it, though, came a different set of challenges altogether.\n\n\nA post shared by foodpandasg (@foodpandasg)\n“It was a very exceptional period where everyone was stuck at home and all restaurants were shut down and only available for delivery. To be able to absorb such growth so fast was actually a huge logistical challenge. Hopefully, we played a part in trying to keep the F&B ecosystem alive and helped restaurants stay afloat during those super tough months,” Andreani recalled.\nIndeed, the pandemic has accelerated change on a global scale, particularly the growth of e-commerce businesses. It has also given rise to the phenomenon of q-commerce, which refers to quick commerce: The next-level evolution of e-commerce characterised by hyper-convenience and hyper-efficient delivery within 20 to 30 minutes as opposed to delivery shipments of several days.\nDiversification is now the name of the game, with foodpanda innovating new ways to optimise and deploy its fleet of\xa0riders in Singapore.\n“We asked ourselves how can we use our huge fleet to do something besides food delivery that makes sense, so diversification is now a key part of our strategy,” he said.\nEnter pandamart, its own grocery store and marketplace for merchant partners, which launched last year. Users can shop for groceries including fresh meat and seafood and place their orders within the existing foodpanda app itself, along with up to 6,000 products from partners such as Cheers, 7-Eleven and Guardian and have it delivered within half an hour. New verticals are constantly being added, with electronics and non-prescription healthcare products coming on stream next.\n\n\n“The trick of diversification into other verticals is to do it slowly, carefully and try to do it well. A counter example I would use is honestbee, which diversified very fast and their core positioning early on was to do everything. This lack of focus maybe caused them a lot of issues,” Andreani observed.\nThen, there’s also pandago, a new logistics-as-a-service solution offering on-demand delivery services for businesses. Pick-up orders are placed via a separate, dedicated app by businesses and restaurants like KFC and Pizza Hut, which use this service on a large-scale. Meanwhile, customer-to-customer deliveries using the foodpanda fleet is slated to launch in the second half of the year.\nAlso in the works are plans to pioneer drone delivery via pandafly, which in 2020 successfully completed a trial delivery via drone comprised of five packets of ayam penyet to a vessel off the coast of Marina South. The company is working with the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore and ST Engineering to push through drone deliveries in the city “as soon as possible”.\n“Besides regulations, it also depends on how fast the tech evolves because one of the limitations at the moment is the battery life… so it could be six months or two years from now,” Andreani said.\n“Do we plan to take Grab head-on? Absolutely. But being obsessed with them? No. We’d rather focus on improving our business in-house. We definitely look at what they do well, what they don’t do well, and we try to always be the best but it’s super important for us to not trail behind and not overly focus on what the competition is doing but to also innovate,” he said.\nYou could say it’s a healthy obsession that parallels Andreani’s own nature and penchant for personal growth.\nDuring the circuit breaker, he started making electronic dance music at home and picked up writing as a hobby to “clarify his thoughts”. The multi-linguist who also speaks German is now learning Thai, inspired by his Thai wife, while his daily routine includes a 10km outdoor run while listening to podcasts, and a half-hour meditation practice using the Calm app.\n“Meditating doesn't help with concrete business decisions but it sometimes helps me take a step back and not act in the spur of the moment, but with a bit of calm and distance. It’s changing my life.”\nPerhaps it’s also helping to shape the evolution of the business, and it’s exciting to see where else foodpanda will leave its paw-prints next.\nShot on location at Garibaldi Italian Restaurant & Bar.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     food ', '     delivery ', '     Singapore ', '     Asia ', '     Profiles ']}"

      No menu, no expectations: This fine-dining restaurant is full of surprises
  </h1>, 'text': ""When diners come to Karmakamet Conveyance, they usually don’t know what to expect. The conceptual fine-dining restaurant has no itemised menu. Only a single word “appreciation” serves as a hint to what will be served.\nCo-founder Jutamas Theantae, or chef Som as she’s fondly called, eschews labels and wants diners to form their own interpretations of her dishes. She said, “I just want you to interact with the food. It’s like when you were little, you were given crayons and you started to draw.”\nHer artistic approach towards cooking stems from her art studies, which she undertook from the ages of 15 to 28. When a career as an artist didn’t work out, she turned to her other dream – cooking.\nShe shared, “Like how I would paint a picture, my cooking is the same. I would close my eyes and imagine.”\n\n\nHer passion for food took her to the United States where she worked her way up the fine-dining scene. Upon returning to Thailand in 2013, she fulfilled her childhood dream of opening a restaurant.\nThe word “conveyance” in the restaurant’s name is a reflection of Chef Som’s desire to celebrate diversity and her recipes embody different cultures and culinary styles. Her dishes are based on her memories, but she never reveals her inspiration to diners because she doesn’t want them to be stuck with particular references.\n“With the first three or four courses, people are unsure. They don't know what to focus on,” she said. “When it comes to the fifth course, they let go. They have fun and they find their own space. The philosophy of the restaurant is to bring you into a new place, which should be an empty space.”\nHer latest menu is inspired by her hometown in the province of Prachuap Khiri Khan, which is a four-hour drive from Bangkok. There, she finds comfort in the mountains and the sea. She mused, “I like to go and sit by the ocean and just stare at the infinite sea, because I can find peace. Infinity is peace and beauty. It belongs to everyone. And that's why [the menu] is called ‘appreciation’.”\nChef Som uses taste as a form of experiencing art. Her vision for her food is akin to that of an oil painting – she creates layers, with a flurry of flavours in between. The cooking method is traditional, but the plating is modern and invites exploration.\n“Home” is a delicate minimalist structure of asparagus and chlorophyll, while “Kopai” River is a biscuit sandwich of pineapple jam, onion seeds and mustard oil presented on a white open palm. But diners don’t know what the ingredients are when the dishes are served because she feels that it’s not important to talk about them.\nShe explained, “I feel like it’s not important to talk about the ingredients because being a chef is about using good ingredients already. I am doing something else here. I want my guests to clear their minds first without me telling them and then they can think.\n“When you come to this kind of restaurant, you have come past a point where you just go to a restaurant to fill up your stomach and to feel like it's so comforting because it's so tasty. No, you come because you want to feel the excitement or you want to find something new. It can even be the food for your soul.”\nAdapted from the series Remarkable Living (Season 3).

      Two-Michelin-starred Japanese restaurant Waku Ghin reopens at Marina Bay Sands
  </h1>, 'text': 'In the mood for an unforgettable Japanese\xa0dining experience? After closing its doors in 2019 for extensive renovations, Waku Ghin, known as one of Singapore’s gourmet meccas, has now reopened at Marina Bay Sands.\nRenowned chef Tetsuya Wakuda remains at the helm of the restaurant. The dining space, however, has undergone significant transformation.\xa0\nPaying tribute to Wakuda’s Japanese roots, the space is designed by award-winning Japanese designer Yohei Akao, and features a minimalist design that integrates natural materials and intricate details that pay ode to nature and heritage.\nAt the restaurant’s new entrance located adjacent to its previous location, diners are greeted by a majestic two-tonne stone sculpture from Shikoku, Japan, towering over the reception.\nThe dining journey begins at the bar, where guests can enjoy Japanese cocktails crafted by head bartender, Kazuhiro Chii. The bar area has now been extended to incorporate 24 seats. An a la carte menu has also been introduced, featuring pastas, donburis and indulgent bar bites. \xa0\nGourmands would be glad to know that the restaurant’s signature omakase experience has remained at the exclusive 10-seater Chef’s Table, where a chef personally attends to each group of guests. Here, time-honoured carpentry by craftsmen from Shikoku, Japan, is imbued in the dining table, forged using Kaba Zakura (Japanese cherry) with natural wood lines.\nKnown for its rich colour and fine-grained texture, the cherry wood’s unique characteristics and annular lines become more prominent and distinct over time after rounds of polishing.\nSimilar to the previous Waku Ghin, diners can feast on the restaurant\'s\xa0exquisite seasonal menu, featuring the famed marinated botan shrimp with sea urchin and oscietra caviar, alongside seasonal delights such as the prized Western Australian pearl meat.\nThe omakase menu has now been extended to include a selection of fresh grill items. Choose from a wider range of premium beef cuts and seafood for the day, ranging from ohmi wagyu and aburi sukiyaki, to fresh carabinero and scampi.\xa0\nThe indulgent meal comes to a close at the private dessert room,\xa0tucked away at the back of the restaurant overlooking the expansive mall and glistening waterfront. Here,\xa0diners will be treated to an array of intricate desserts.\n“The new Waku Ghin is more contemporary and accessible via the expanded offering at The Bar. But guests can also find pockets of exclusivity through our two private dining rooms and Chef’s Table,"" said Wakuda.\xa0\n""From culinary origins to design inspiration, I’ve taken the time to dig deeper into my Japanese roots to present a fresh new interpretation of Waku Ghin – one where diners get to journey and taste the best of Japan across different prefectures and seasons,” he continued.\xa0\nThe Bar at Waku Ghin opens from 5pm daily, while the Chef’s Table welcomes guests from 5.30pm till late.

      Thai cocktail bars transformed in fight to survive COVID-19 impact
  </h1>, 'text': 'BANGKOK: Bottles of black liquid lined the bar, where cocktails would normally be concocted with different gins from around the world. But on this day, they contained black vinegar, used to complement the bar’s latest offering - dumplings.\nA few staff members were outside manning a small pop-up stall that had become their main source of income since the year started.\xa0\nFor nearly two months, this has been the harsh reality for a hip gin bar in Bangkok’s old quarter, Teens of Thailand - a direct and financially damaging impact of the government’s order in early January to shut pubs and bars in an attempt to control a new wave of COVID-19 outbreak.\n“At first we thought ‘Again?’. There was hardly any time to get prepared,” co-founder Niks Anuman Rajadhon told CNA.\n""There was an emotional breakdown before we recalibrated and decided what to do next.""\nWeeks of zero alcohol sales have forced many bars to adjust for survival. For the likes of Teens of Thailand, doing so has also transformed the way they operate for good.\nNiks is passionate about bartending, craft spirits and cocktails. He never thought he would one day be selling pork dumplings or having to taste so many brands of black vinegar. But after his bar was forced to close twice in less than a year - for three months the first time - he knew the business could not survive on cocktails alone, as long as the government could order it shut any time there was an outbreak.\n“So we came up with an idea of having a bar that also sells dumplings, steamed food, soup or rice porridge. We want to incorporate food because we know alcohol businesses in this country have a high chance of becoming a scapegoat. They would be closed first and blamed first without any relief measures or support,” he said.\nA new wave of COVID-19 cases\xa0hit Thailand in December last year after large clusters were detected in different parts of the country. They involved a shrimp market and gambling dens among other places.\xa0\nThe situation prompted\xa0the government to roll out various tough measures to contain the pandemic. These included an order to close pubs and bars and a ban on alcohol consumption at eateries in areas at risk of infection.\xa0\nBangkok was among the affected provinces. The announcement was made on Jan 1 late at night by the city governor before taking effect the following morning.\xa0\nFor Niks, who owns three cocktail bars in Bangkok, it felt like unemployment without any compensation. While his employees were paid\xa0compensation from the Social Security Fund, business owners like him - who continued to pay rent, utilities and the staff - were not eligible.\nIt was not until earlier this week that the government lifted the alcohol ban and allowed most pubs bars to reopen. Still, Niks said the dumplings will remain on the menu in case the same measures return to hurt his businesses.\nFROM COCKTAILS TO ICE-CREAM\nBesides Teens of Thailand, several other bars were also forced to change their business model during the weeks-long closure.\nQ&A, a speakeasy-style bar in one of Bangkok’s alleyways, turned itself into an ice-cream parlour to stay afloat. Its owner Attapon De-silva, who has spent the past 13 years bartending, spent nearly a month learning how to make ice-cream from scratch. He researched, read books and experimented with an ice-cream maker borrowed from a former colleague before launching Q&A’s sub-brand, QreAm.\nThe idea of selling ice-cream came up in his conversation with his mother after the bar was ordered shut. “I asked her what I should sell and what are the things people like to eat,” he said. “She replied ‘perhaps ice-cream’ and I thought she was joking.”\nIn its initial phase, the ice-cream bar offers seven flavours from vanilla and chocolate to GNT sorbet. The latter is served with dehydrated lemon coated in sugar and edible flowers.\xa0\nAccording to Attapon, each scoop of his ice-cream is infused with the identity of cocktail bars, especially the respect for finely selected raw materials and how they are put together to elevate the taste.\nHowever, behind his beautiful creations lies an uncertain future. Although the cocktail bar is now able to operate again, Attapon and his staff have no idea how long it would take before another outbreak, another alcohol ban and another closure.\n“I’m sure we won’t have just two waves of COVID-19. I’m quite confident this situation will remain with us for a while, years,” he said. “QreAm will remain with us forever. It wouldn’t just open during lockdown or whenever we can’t sell alcohol.”\nNEW LAW PROHIBITS ONLINE ALCOHOL SALES\nSince early last year, many\xa0businesses in Thailand have felt the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The international travel ban has caused many operators in the tourism and food and beverage sectors\xa0to lose their main income.\xa0\nWhile many businesses expanded their presence online to reach more local customers, particularly during the lockdown, the likes of pubs and bars whose main source of income is alcohol found it more challenging to follow the market trend.\nOn Dec 7 last year, the sale\xa0of alcohol via electronic channels that are not carried out in person became illegal in Thailand, following an announcement by the Prime Minister’s Office published in the Royal Gazette.\nThe prohibition includes direct sales and attempts to promote alcoholic beverages online but excludes electronic payments at retail stores and eateries. According to the announcement, the ban was imposed to “prevent youths from easily accessing alcoholic beverages and reduce the impact caused by them”.\nSo for nearly two months when pubs and bars were ordered to close and alcohol consumption at eateries was banned, these businesses could not continue selling their alcoholic products online.\n“We suffered a lot. We have\xa0a burden of taking care of many staff members,” said Asawin Rojmethatawee, co-founder of Tep Bar in Bangkok. “This doesn’t include the first round (of closure last year)\xa0when we scaled down our business a lot without letting anyone go.”\nTep Bar is well-known among hip bar hoppers for its cocktails inspired by local Thai ingredients and culture. Before the pandemic, about 80 per cent of its customers were\xa0foreign tourists. Asawin said his business now relies on only 20 per cent of its clientele but most of the expenses remain because he continues to hire all the staff.\nUnable to sell alcohol online while the bar was closed, Tep Bar’s management team came up with a strategy.\n“Our bar has already used Thai herbs. We’ve already worked with certified Thai traditional medicine practitioners to create our drinks. So we thought we should return to our roots without using alcohol,” Asawin said.\n“We came up with a new business segment that is Thai herbal drinks with real potency and benefits. There are seven recipes offering different benefits of different herbs.”\nThe drinks are branded as Tep Chana Booster - a play on the Thai word ""chana""\xa0or ""win"", which the government has used to name a few projects in its fight against COVID-19.\xa0\nAccording to Asawin, the feedback has been so good\xa0that Tep Chana will be incorporated into the bar’s merchandise.\n“Customers will be able to buy them home or drink them at the bar. Cafes in other provinces have ordered big batches of them for sale too. So, this has become our sub-brand, which can grow further,” he said.\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\n', 'related_topics': ['     Thailand ', '     COVID-19 ', '     food ']}"

      In Bangkok, a chef couple who only use Thai ingredients in their restaurant
  </h1>, 'text': 'In the heart of one of Bangkok’s oldest riverfront districts Bang Rak lies 80/20, an industrial-chic restaurant that captures the heritage and progressive nature of Thai cuisine.\nOwned by husband-and-wife team, Thai chef Napol “Joe” Jantraget and Japanese pastry chef Saki Hoshino, 80/20 was so named to represent the ratio of Thai ingredients to imported ones used in its dishes.\n\n\nIt was also Hoshino’s idea of working hard 80 per cent of the time and playing the remainder 20 per cent, yet still achieving top marks – a throwback to her strategy as a student. The restaurant vibes with a casual, edgy energy and the fine-dining dishes exude a local charm.\nThe couple often travels across Thailand in search of culinary gems and to build relationships with the local farmers. “They really appreciate when we take their produce seriously. And when they feel that appreciation, they put in more care and effort for the produce,” Hoshino shared.\nOn one of their trips, they discovered a farm that used natural processes to produce sea grapes that shone with outstanding freshness. These and other produce are used in a medley of Asian-inspired dishes that change according to the seasons. For example, shrimp and lobster make their appearance during the rainy season in creative ways, such as a seaweed-cured lobster with sea grape paste presented in an elegant flower-shaped bowl.\n“When we, as Thai chefs, use more local produce and highlight it more, it helps them to grow more as well,” Jantraget said. “If we don’t consume things that we actually have, no one will grow them. And these things will die away.”\n\n\nJantraget and Hoshino’s love story is also a beautiful tale. Both met as students in Canada and worked together for a decade there. They then decided to return to their own home countries to continue their careers.\nLater, when the French restaurant Jantraget was working in closed down, he called Hoshino, who then suggested opening 80/20. The rest, as they say, is history.\nIn 2018, the couple decided to launch a 10-course tasting menu that used 100 per cent Thai produce. They also expanded and renovated the restaurant but kept part of the old wall as a nod to their history as they continue exploring new culinary grounds.\nJantraget said, “Like any wall that was created in terms of Thai cuisine, we want to break it.”\n\n\nEven though the public’s reaction was lukewarm – business slowed down at first – the couple stuck it out. In 2020, 80/20 earned its first Michelin star. “After all the years that we tried to push ourselves to do something different with Thai cuisine, I feel that our work was recognised,” said Jantraget. “It was like giving myself a little pat on the back and saying, ‘Let’s keep going’.”\nThe humble chef credits the restaurant’s 11-strong team for contributing to the success of 80/20 with their diverse backgrounds. “What they ate and what they saw growing up would be totally different. I use this knowledge and exchange of experiences to begin the creative process,” Jantraget shared.\nHe adds that he wants 80/20 to become an institution for the next generation of Thai cooks who would think differently about Thai ingredients.\n“My role here is not only to cook or use local Thai ingredients, but to increase the value and awareness of what we have here in Thailand. It’s my dream and goal to see Thai cuisine become one of the best in the world. I believe we have what it takes.”\nAdapted from the series Remarkable Living (Season 3).

      The young female duo bent on educating Singapore diners about food waste
  </h1>, 'text': 'How often do we sit down at the table for a meal and wolf down everything without mulling over its provenance or means of production?\nIn Singapore, two friends – Lisa Tang, 26, and Kuah Chew Shian, 28 – wanted people to think more about the food they eat, especially ingredients that are typically overlooked or discarded. So they started 16-seat private diner Kausmo in 2019, the name derived from the word “cosmos”.\n\n\nRestaurant manager Kuah said, “It is derived from the word ‘cosmos’, which means a system of thoughts because we are a restaurant based on the concept of thoughtfulness.”\nTang, who is the chef, added: “Chew and I are always for the underdogs. We really appreciate things that should be appreciated, but the mass majority does not.”\nThe cosy restaurant, located in Shaw Centre, has an inviting atmosphere akin to entering a friend’s home. “This space is for sparking conversations about unnecessary food wastage and understanding more about our food system,” Tang enthused.\nBacked by the Les Amis Group, Kausmo serves a six-course omakase menu that is occasionally updated. It focuses on parts of proteins that may be underrated or less appreciated by people, such as pork collar.\n\n\nTang explained, “We serve it thick to appreciate how the different textures play in that piece of meat. You get collagen, fat and lean meat.”\nShe and Kuah also find creative ways to repurpose fruits and vegetables that are usually rejected by retailers. For example, overripe and overstocked nectarines are cooked down and sent to a friend who runs a gelato shop to make into sherbets for Kausmo’s desserts.\nAfter attending a local culinary school, Tang went to the US when she was 23, where she worked at Primo, a full-circle, farm-to-table restaurant. After opening Kausmo in June 2019, she was nominated for the Rising Female Chef award at the World Gourmet Summit that year.\nThe stint at Primo led Tang to better appreciate the vegetables and herbs Singapore has.\n“Ingredients like thyme and rosemary are actually growing in abundance as weeds overseas. But they appreciate it so much that they are able to export it out and allow many other people across countries to appreciate it,” said Tang.\n“So, why can’t we? Do we even know what we have here? There’s so much we have here that are gems, in terms of flavour, texture, and aesthetics. There is beautiful produce all around us.”\nThe duo partnered Singaporean farmer Evelyn Eng-Lim to tap into her knowledge of native greens. Eng-Lim has been running a vegetable farm in Neo Tiew for the past 22 years, and is probably the only one to grow perennial kampung vegetables because “many Singaporeans don’t know how to eat (them)”, said Eng-Lim.\nTang added, “This is one of the rare, organic and bio-diverse farms that focuses on native edibles that we really need in our land. [These plants] thrive in our climate effortlessly, so they require lesser resources like water and care to grow. They are not only nutritious, they are [also] very flavourful.”\nShe cites examples such as the Tonkin Jasmine, which is mostly used in scrambled eggs and was often used by her grandparents in their cooking. Kausmo also gets fresh Java ginseng, wild pepper and ulam raja from the farm. They are used in dishes such as a frog congee served with java ginseng and preserved plum-dressed chilli.\nKuah said, “It’s been quite a fulfilling experience. Kausmo is a labour of love and I think it really is because we put our heart into every aspect of this concept. It has been an incredible journey that we are very proud of.”\nAdapted from the series Remarkable Living (Season 3).

But when Kinki Restaurant and Bar first opened here 10 years ago, it still managed to cause a stir with its refreshing concept. From its cheeky moniker, to its funky interiors and innovative food, Kinki was certainly not a conventional Japanese restaurant.\nA decade\xa0on, the restaurant, located at Customs House, has undergone a revamp, reopening its doors today (Feb 19). For one, the menu has been refreshed and updated.\xa0\xa0\nClassic, Instagram-worthy favourites such as the signature Rock and Roll maki (S$22)\xa0and Cowabunga (S$36) still remain, but new dishes include the Unagi Claypot (S$35) that was once served only on occasion as a chef’s special.\nOther new dishes to try include the Corn Duo, an appetiser where baby corn is mixed with corn puree and tossed with furikake bits, served alongside a sriracha mayo sauce, as well as the Grilled Squid Chimichurri, a smoky and tender charcoal-grilled squid.\nOn Saturdays, make a booking for The Bottomless Brunch (S$68), where you can feast on unlimited a la carte servings of sushi, sashimi, maki, hot and cold Japanese favourites, and desserts. For an additional S$35, you’ll get to enjoy free flow beer, sake, Prosecco or shochu.\nFor drinks, expect innovative cocktails woven with Asian influences. There’s the Geisha-Rita (S$22), Kinki’s take on the margarita with Ocho Blanco tequila, Nigori umeshu, cointreau, lime juice and freshly cracked pepper instead of salt.\nThe Gin Assam Boi (S$20) is a nod to the local drinking\xa0culture of having a sugarcane juice with street food. It features Kyro gin, Malibu rum, Gori umeshu and pineapple juice that fuse into an olive-green tint, garnished with Assam powder and a pickled ume.\nThe restaurant also now boasts a new look. Enter the lift at the first level of Customs House and you’ll be greeted by retro Japanese prints stitched into a dizzying collage. The prints, designed by local studio Punkt Creative, evoke Kintsugi, the traditional Japanese art of mending broken pottery by joining fragments with capillaries of gold.\nOn Level Two, the doors open to a modern Japanese tea house. You’ll be greeted by several portraits of geishas on the walls. At the elevated open kitchen counter, watch the chefs prepare the freshest catch of the day.\nSituated on Level Three is the rooftop bar. The previous dragon and sakura motifs have now given way to colour-saturated pop-art graffiti walls at the entrance. Snap a picture for Instagram against the Japanese characters for Kinki, fashioned in neon LED lights. The rooftop bar also boasts stunning views of the bayfront. \xa0\nKinki is located at\xa070 Collyer Quay, #02-02 Customs House, Singapore 049323\n', 'related_topics': ['     dining ', '     gastronomy ', '     food ', '     Singapore ', '     Restaurants ', '     Fine dining ']}"

      Bukan hanya makanan Jawa, Padang, dan Sunda: Koki muda mau orang Indonesia mengenal beragam masakan Nusantara
  </h1>, 'text': 'JAKARTA: Saat menyebut “makanan Indonesia”, bagi sebagian besar warga negara\xa0asing mungkin yang terlintas di benak\xa0adalah nasi goreng dan nasi padang.\nNamun, masakan Indonesia sangat beragam mengingat luas\xa0wilayahnya dan terdapat lebih dari 600 kelompok etnis di tanah air, kata koki selebritas Renatta Moeloek.\nKetika mengikuti tur kuliner di Eropa beberapa tahun yang lalu, Renatta mendapat kesempatan untuk menyajikan hidangan Indonesia di restoran lokal di Spanyol, Belgia, dan Slovakia.\nDia menyajikan naniura (acar ikan mentah dari Sumatera Utara), gehu (tahu isi) dan opor ayam untuk para tamu.\n“Mereka semua sangat tertarik, banyak yang kagum dan kaget. Mereka tidak tahu masakan Indonesia begitu beragam karena yang mereka tahu hanya nasi goreng, rendang, mie goreng, dan sate,” kenangnya.\nBanyak yang bahkan ingin memiliki resepnya, kata juru masak berusia 26 tahun itu kepada CNA.\nRenatta, yang menjadi tenar berkat perannya sebagai juri MasterChef Indonesia, mengakui bahwa masakan Indonesia memang tidak seterkenal masakan Asia lainnya.\nMasakan Vietnam, Thailand, dan Cina, misalnya, diterima secara luas di negara-negara barat.\n“Tapi makanan Indonesia masih berusaha mencapai level itu,” ujarnya.\nAgar sajian Indonesia mendunia, orang Indonesia pertama-tama harus berinisiatif mempelajari makanan lokal dan mengapresiasinya, ujar Renatta.\nIa pun memperkenalkan berbagai jenis masakan Indonesia kepada orang-orang.\nKetika tampil dalam berbagai kesempatan dia biasa menyajikan makanan Indonesia terutama seperti naniura dan gohu tuna.\nDia menilai bahwa semakin banyak orang Indonesia yang mulai menunjukkan ketertarikan pada masakan Nusantara, maka semakin besar harapan bahwa suatu hari makanan Indonesia bisa mendapatkan pengakuan yang layak.\nORANG INDONESIA HARUS MENGETAHUI MASAKAN SENDIRI: RENATTA\nRenatta berpendapat bahwa secara umum orang Indonesia tidak begitu mengetahui tentang masakan lokalnya.\n“Saya kebetulan di Jakarta, di Pulau Jawa. Jadi kalau tanya orang masakan Indonesia, tahunya masakan Jawa, Padang, atau Sunda. Ya ayam goreng, tempe, sambal, padahal kan jauh dari itu,” kata koki yang kerap disebut sebagai ""Chef"" Renatta tersebut.\nMisalnya, ada makanan khas Manado, kuliner Maluku, dan masakan suku Batak yang semuanya memiliki teknik memasak berbeda.\nKetika Renatta belajar di sekolah kuliner dan perhotelan Le Cordon Bleu di Paris, Prancis, banyak orang Indonesia yang berkomentar betapa beruntungnya dia bisa menikmati ""foie gras"" (hati bebek atau angsa) sementara orang Indonesia biasanya makan tempe.\n""Padahal mereka enggak tahu, tempe di Prancis harganya berapa … Mereka enggak tahu tempe di Prancis untuk yang kalangan makan makanan sehat, vegetarian, itu sangat mahal dan susah didapatkan dan jauh lebih mahal daripada foie gras.""\nOleh karena itu, upaya mengenalkan masakan Indonesia ke dunia luar harus dimulai dengan orang Indonesia mau mengenal dan menikmati makanannya sendiri.\n“Mengapa kita perlu memperkenalkan masakan Indonesia kepada orang asing jika orang Indonesia sendiri tidak begitu mengenal masakan dalam negeri?” tanyanya.\nSembari mempromosikan hidangan Nusantara, Renatta juga ingin mengubah\xa0persepsi bahwa makanan Indonesia itu tidak sehat.\nSebagai seorang juru masak, dia sadar akan kesehatan tetapi dia mengamati bahwa pola makan yang sehat belum banyak diterapkan di Indonesia.\n“Sangat mudah mengubah makanan Indonesia menjadi makanan sehat karena kita menggunakan banyak rempah-rempah.\n“Bawang putih, bawang merah, cabai, lengkuas, kunyit … berapa kalorinya? Hampir enggak ada.”\nAlih-alih digoreng, bahan makanan bisa dipanggang di oven, katanya. Bumbu juga dapat dikurangi untuk mengurangi asupan gula dan natrium.\nMENJADI TERKENAL SECARA TAK TERDUGA\nKecintaan Renatta pada makanan sudah terlihat sejak dia masih kecil.\nIa selalu suka memasak dan membuat kue, dan sering memberikan kue buatannya kepada teman-teman di sekolah dan mengundang mereka ke rumah untuk mencoba masakannya.\nKetika dia menyelesaikan sekolah menengah atas, dia memutuskan untuk melanjutkan pendidikan di Le Cordon Bleu di Paris.\nSetelah berkuliah selama delapan bulan dan tujuh bulan bermagang, Renatta kembali ke Indonesia pada tahun 2015 untuk mengurus visa kerjanya setelah dia mendapatkan\xa0tawaran kerja di Selandia Baru.\nSambil menunggu visanya diterbitkan, Renatta bekerja lepas sebagai koki pribadi di Jakarta.\xa0\nSeiring waktu, dia mendapatkan banyak klien, mulai dari pegawai\xa0kedutaan hingga hotel dan restoran papan\xa0atas.\nIa kemudian memutuskan untuk melepas kesempatan bekerja di Selandia Baru dan tetap berkarya di Indonesia.\nPada tahun 2018, ia bergabung dengan MasterChef Indonesia sebagai salah satu juri dan saat itulah dia mencuri hati orang Indonesia dengan sikap percaya dirinya. Ia sudah tampil di acara itu selama tiga musim.\n“Saya juga masih belajar. Soalnya saya biasanya enggak terlalu nyaman di depan kamera ... Biasanya kan kerja di dapur.\xa0\n""Tapi berhubung di MasterChef itu jatuhnya \'reality show\', kamera ada di samping tapi kita enggak perlu lihat kamera sama sekali, semuanya \'real\'.

      Pickled raw fish and stuffed tofu: Young chef wants to encourage Indonesians to enjoy local cuisine
  </h1>, 'text': 'JAKARTA: When “Indonesian food” is mentioned, most foreigners would probably think of ubiquitous staples like nasi goreng and nasi padang.\nBut Indonesian cuisine is extremely diverse, thanks to the country’s geographical expanse and over 600 ethnic groups, said celebrity chef Renatta Moeloek.\nOn a food tour in Europe a few years ago, where she ran pop-up in local restaurants in Spain, Belgium and Slovakia, she served naniura (pickled raw fish from North Sumatera), gehu (stuffed tofu) and opor ayam (chicken in coconut milk) to her guests.\n“They were all very interested, many were amazed and surprised. They didn’t know that Indonesian dishes are so diverse because all they knew were nasi goreng, rendang, mie goreng and sate,” she recounted.\nMany even wanted to have the recipes, the 26-year-old told CNA.\nMoeloek, who became a household name for her role as MasterChef Indonesia judge, acknowledged that Indonesian cuisine is not as well-known as other Asian cuisines. Vietnamese, Thai and Chinese food, for instance, are widely accepted in the western countries.\n“But Indonesian food is still trying to reach that level,” she said.\nIn order for Indonesian cuisine to attain global fame, Indonesians first must take the initiative to learn about their local food and appreciate them, she opined.\n\n\nMoeloek is using her newfound fame to introduce different types of Indonesian dishes to people. When she hosts post-up events, she makes it a point to serve mainly Indonesian food such as\xa0naniura and gohu tuna (raw tuna salad).\nShe noted that more Indonesians start to show an interest in the local cuisine, which gives her hope that Indonesian food can one day gain the recognition it deserves.\xa0\nINDONESIANS SHOULD KNOW AND ENJOY\xa0LOCAL FOOD: MOELOEK\nMoeloek noted that in general, Indonesians do not know much about their local dishes.\n“I live in Jakarta, which is on Java island. So if someone asks about Indonesian food, what we know is Javanese food, Padang or Sundanese (food) such as ayam goreng, tempe, sambal, while in fact, we have so much more,” she said.\nFor instance, there are Manadonese food, cuisine from Maluku and cooking of the Batak ethnic groups, which all have different cooking techniques.\nMoeloek recalled when she was studying at culinary and hospitality school Le Cordon Bleu in Paris, France, many Indonesians remarked how lucky she was to get to savour foie gras while her fellow countrymen ate tempe (fermented soybean).\n“But they don’t know how expensive tempe is in France… They don’t know that those who like to eat healthy food, vegans in France, find it very expensive and hard to get. It’s far more expensive than foie gras,” she said.\n\n\nTherefore, efforts to introduce Indonesian cuisine to the outside world have to start with Indonesians knowing and enjoying their own food.\n“Why do we need to introduce Indonesian cuisine to foreigners if Indonesians themselves don’t really know their local cuisine well enough?” she said.\nWhile at it, Moeloek also wants to challenge the perception that Indonesian food is unhealthy. As a chef, she is health conscious but she has observed that healthy eating is not yet widely adopted in Indonesia.\n“It is very easy to turn Indonesian food into healthy food because we use many spices.\n“Garlic, shallots, chillies, galangal, turmeric... how many calories are there? Barely any.”\nInstead of deep-frying, food ingredients can be grilled in the oven, she said. Seasonings can be reduced to cut down on sugar and sodium intake as well.\n\n\nMOELOEK\'S SHOT TO FAME\nMoeloek’s passion for food began when she was young. She had always loved cooking and baking, and often gave homemade cookies to friends at school and invited them home to try her cooking.\nWhen she finished high school, she decided to continue her studies at Le Cordon Bleu in Paris.\nAfter an intensive eight-month study and seven months of internship, Moeloek returned to Indonesia in 2015 to sort out her working visa as she had an opportunity to work in New Zealand.\nWhile waiting for her visa to be issued, Moeloek freelanced as a private dining chef in Jakarta and over time she amassed many clients, ranging from embassy officials to high-end hotels and restaurants.\xa0\nShe then decided to let go of the job opportunity in New Zealand and remained in Indonesia.\xa0\nIn 2018, she joined MasterChef Indonesia as one of its judges and that was when she stole the hearts of Indonesians with her confident demeanour and shot to fame.\xa0She has since been with the show for three seasons.\xa0\n“I am still learning. The thing is, I\'m usually not too comfortable being in front of the camera. For example, when there is a cooking demo, not everyone can be comfortable with having to cook in front of the camera because usually, we work in the kitchen.\n\n\n“But since MasterChef is a reality show, there are cameras on the sides but we don\'t need to see the camera at all, everything is real. So for me, it\'s still okay. In fact, it\'s fun to meet Indonesians who have a passion for cooking, so it\'s a new experience.""\nIn addition to running a private dining restaurant in South Jakarta, Moeloek also established her delivery food business specialised in Indonesian food. She is also involved in two other business ventures that focus on eating balanced nutritious food.\nWith the current COVID-19 pandemic, many food and beverages businesses have been hit hard. Moeloek applauded professional chefs who are willing to try something new and step out of their comfort zone.\n“I now see many chefs who previously only wanted to work in hotels and fine dining moving over to comfort food, takeaways or online delivery business.\n“I think there is a positive side to this because at the end of the day, if professional chefs can work on simple and affordable food for many people, why not?\n“The competition (in the industry) will then get better,” she said.\nRead this story in Bahasa Indonesia here.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Indonesia ', '     Jakarta ', '     food ', '     business ']}"

      Mentega, kunci kelezatan lapis legit di sebuah toko kue berusia 45 tahun di Jakarta
  </h1>, 'text': 'JAKARTA: Setiap lapisan kue lapis legit diyakini oleh orang Indonesia keturunan Tionghoa sebagai simbol keberuntungan.\nKue lapis legit terdiri dari tumpukan pelbagai lapisan kue tipis yang terbuat dari mentega, margarin, susu, dan telur.\nUntuk menambah cita rasa disertakan cengkeh, kayu manis, dan pala yang membuat warna kue terlihat seperti warna daging babi asap.\nOleh karena itu, meski tidak mengandung daging babi, kue lapis legit juga dikenal dengan nama spekuk, yang dalam bahasa Belanda berarti kue daging babi asap.\nWalaupun kue lapis legit ada di mana-mana di Jakarta, kue dari toko Happy termasuk yang paling terkenal karena rasa, sejarah, dan harganya.\nSelama 45 tahun, kue dari toko di Jakarta Selatan ini diburu orang menjelang Imlek.\n""Ini adalah tradisi Cina di sini untuk membelinya pas Tahun Baru Imlek,"" kata Liena Gusman, pemilik toko kue Happy.\n“Kue itu melambangkan banyak keberuntungan, itulah sebabnya kue ini banyak dicari saat Tahun Baru Imlek,” tambahnya.\nKue berukuran 20cm x 20cm tersebut tersedia dalam rasa orisinal, atau dengan buah prem, keju, dan kenari.\nNamun, mentegalah yang membedakan kue dari toko Happy dengan para pesaing, kata Liena.\n“Kami menggunakan mentega terbaik, mentega (impor dari) Belanda,” ungkap wanita berusia 60 tahun tersebut.\nSemakin banyak mentega yang dimiliki suatu varian, semakin mahal harganya.\nJenis termurah, yang hanya menggunakan margarin, berharga Rp445.000.\nJika mentega yang digunakan banyak, harga kue bisa mencapai lebih dari Rp1,1 juta, sehingga kue lapis legit Happy kerap dijuluki sebagai kue lapis legit termahal di ibu kota.\n“Kue itu sulit dibuat. Butuh sekitar 2,5 sampai 3 jam,” kata Liena sambil menambahkan bahwa dia sama sekali tidak menggunakan bahan pengawet.\nDARI PENJUAL ROTAN MENJADI TUKANG KUE\nLiena adalah generasi kedua pemilik toko kue Happy.\nAyahnya, Gunaifi Lay, 88, dahulu merupakan seorang penjual rotan di Palembang, Sumatera Selatan.\nKarena kurang berhasil, pada tahun 1969 dia memutuskan untuk membawa keluarganya pindah ke Jakarta dengan harapan akan mendapatkan penghidupan yang lebih baik.\nBermodal hanya Rp300, Gunaifi menyewa sebuah kamar di Jakarta Pusat untuk keluarganya yang beranggotakan enam orang. Uangnya yang tersisa hanya cukup untuk membeli telur.\nIstrinya, seorang pembuat kue yang ulet, membuat kue bolu dari telur tersebut dan Gunaifi memutuskan untuk menjualnya.\nSeiring waktu, penjualan kue meningkat dan seorang teman menyuruhnya membuat kue lapis legit karena lebih dicari daripada kue bolu.\nLangkah itu menuai untung. Gunaifi kemudian membeli rumah di pinggir jalan Haji Nawi, Jakarta Selatan untuk keluarganya.\nMereka tetap menjual kue ke para pedagang hingga suatu hari seorang pria mengetuk pintu rumah mereka.\nDia mengatakan ia mencium aroma lapis legit yang harum dan ingin membelinya.\nHal itu memicu Gunaifi untuk membangun toko roti di depan rumahnya pada tahun 1976.\nOleh karena kue dimaksudkan untuk acara-acara bahagia, dia menamai toko kue tersebut Happy.\nMereka tidak pernah menggunakan strategi pemasaran tertentu untuk mempromosikan kue toko Happy dan berasumsi bahwa kesuksesan mereka tercipta berkat kabar dari mulut ke mulut.\nSelain kue lapis legit, toko roti ini juga menjual lapis Surabaya, roll tart, kue nastar, spekulas, dan lain-lain.\nSebagai anak pertama dari empat bersaudara, Liena telah membantu mendiang ibunya membuat kue sejak ia baru berusia delapan tahun.\nKebetulan, dia juga satu-satunya yang tertarik membuat kue.\nOleh sebab itu, Liena mengambil alih toko ketika orang tuanya memutuskan untuk mewariskan usaha mereka 20 tahun yang lalu.\nDia ingat masa kejayaan toko roti Happy saat era Presiden Soeharto ketika masih menjadi kebiasaan untuk memberi kerabat kue saat hari-hari istimewa seperti Tahun Baru Imlek dan Idul Fitri.\n“Saya bikin kue dari jam 3 pagi sampai 1 pagi,” kenangnya. Di antara pelanggan mereka termasuk anggota keluarga Soeharto dan selebritas Tanah Air seperti raja dangdut Rhoma Irama dan Ronny Sianturi.\nBANYAK PERMINTAAN DARI WARGA NEGARA ASING\nSetelah jatuhnya Soeharto pada tahun 1998, bisnis keluarga Liena terus menggeliat dengan permintaan pelanggan dari seluruh Indonesia dan dari luar negeri seperti Malaysia, Singapura, bahkan Belanda.\nSebagian besar pelanggan warga negara asing berasal dari Malaysia dan Singapura, ujar Liena.\nPernah suatu ketika, rombongan bus turis tiba di toko Happy karena wisatawan dari Malaysia ingin membeli kue mereka untuk dibawa pulang ke negaranya.\nMereka rela menunggu berjam-jam, kenang Liena.\nDia memiliki banyak permintaan untuk mengekspor kuenya ke luar negeri tetapi ia selalu menolak lantaran khawatir kuenya akan basi karena tidak mengandung bahan pengawet.\nNamun, sejak Indonesia dilanda COVID-19 Maret lalu, bisnis menjadi buruk, ungkap Liena.\n“Sekarang ini sangat buruk. Kita cuman impas,” kata Liena kepada CNA.\nSebelum pandemi, penjualan selama Tahun Baru Imlek biasanya akan meningkat sepuluh kali lipat. Sedangkan pada masa Idul Fitri, keuntungan akan naik 15 kali lipat dari biasanya, katanya.\nAkan tetapi, penjualan saat Idul Fitri yang lalu kurang dari seperempat dari biasanya sehingga Liena terpaksa harus merumahkan sekitar 10 dari 20 karyawannya.\nMeskipun Imlek tahun ini diprediski akan tidak semeriah biasanya karena COVID-19, Liena berharap pelanggan setianya tetap akan membeli lapis legit Happy.\xa0\n""Mereka biasanya beli tiga hari menjelang Imlek.

      Butter makes all the difference for 45-year-old thousand layer cake bakery in Jakarta
  </h1>, 'text': ""JAKARTA: Each layer of the\xa0kue lapis legit\xa0is believed by Indonesians of Chinese descent to symbolise fortune.\nAlso known as thousand layer cake, it comprises many\xa0thin layers piled on each other, made of butter, margarine, milk and egg.\nTo add flavour,\xa0cloves, cinnamon, and nutmeg are included, giving the cake a\xa0colour resembling bacon. Hence,\xa0during Indonesia's Dutch colonial period, the delicacy was known as Spekkoek (bacon cake). \xa0\nWhile kue lapis legit is ubiquitous in Jakarta, the cake from Happy Bakery is among the most famous\xa0due to its taste, history and price.\nFor 45 years, people have been patronising the bakery in South Jakarta when Chinese New Year approaches.\n“It is a Chinese tradition here to buy it for the Chinese New Year,” owner Liena Gusman told CNA.\n“The cake symbolises multiple fortunes, that is why it is sought after during Chinese New Year,” she added.\nThe 20cm x 20 cm cake is available in plain flavour, or\xa0with prunes, cheese and walnuts as toppings.\n\n\nIt is the butter that distinguishes her cake from competitors, said Mdm Gusman, 60. “We use the finest butter, (imported) Dutch butter,” she said.\nThe more butter a variant has, the more expensive it becomes.\nThe cheapest variant, which only uses margarine, goes for\xa0445,000 rupiah (US$31). Depending on the amount of\xa0butter used, it can cost up to 1,120,000 rupiah. The latter is\xa0often dubbed the most expensive kue lapis legit in town.\n“The cake is hard to make. It takes about 2.5 to 3 hours,” Mdm Gusman said, adding that she does not use any preservative.\nFROM RATTAN SELLER TO BAKER\nMdm Gusman is the second-generation owner of Happy Bakery.\nHer father Gunaifi Lay, 88, was a struggling rattan seller in Palembang, South Sumatra who decided to take his family to Jakarta in 1969 in the hope of earning a better living.\nWith only 300 rupiah, Mr Lay rented a room in Central Jakarta for his family of six and had only money left to buy some eggs.\nHis wife, an avid baker, made kue bolu (sponge cake) out of the eggs and\xa0Mr Lay decided to sell the cake.\xa0\nSince Mr Lay was a stranger to Jakarta, he took\xa0the bus and sold it\xa0from one bus terminal to the other.\nOver time, sales started to improve and a friend told him to make kue lapis legit as it was\xa0more sought after than sponge cake.\n\n\nThe move reaped dividends.\xa0Mr Lay later bought a house in South Jakarta for his family.\nThey continued to sell cakes to resellers. One day a man knocked on their door saying that smelled the aroma of their lapis legit and wanted to buy one.\nThat prompted Mr Lay to build a bakery in front of his house in 1976. Since cakes are meant for happy occasions, he\xa0named the bakery Happy.\nThey have never used a particular marketing strategy to promote their cakes and assumed their success\xa0was by word of mouth.\nApart from kue lapis legit, the bakery also sells the 3-layered\xa0lapis Surabaya, pineapple tarts, Dutch spekulas\xa0cookies\xa0and others.\nAs the first child of four, Mdm Gusman had been helping her late mother with baking since she was just eight years old. \xa0\xa0\nCoincidentally, she is also the only child who is interested in baking. Hence, when her parents decided to pass on the business 20 years ago, Mdm Gusman took over.\nShe remembers\xa0the heyday of the bakery to be during Indonesia’s second President Soeharto era when it was still a custom for people to give acquaintances cakes during festive days such as Chinese New Year and Hari Raya.\n“I was baking cakes from 3am until 1am,” she reminisced. Their customers included members of Soeharto’s family and Indonesian celebrities.\nSTRONG DEMAND FROM FOREIGN VISITORS\nAfter Soeharto’s fall in 1998, the business was still booming with customers from all over Indonesia and from abroad such as Malaysia, Singapore and even the Netherlands wanting to get hold of the traditional cake.\nMost of the foreign customers are from Malaysia and Singapore, she said.\nThere were times when\xa0tourist buses arrived at the bakery and Malaysian customers wanted to buy their cake for takeaway. They\xa0were willing to wait for hours, she recalled.\nShe had many requests to export her cakes abroad but she always declined out of fear that the freshness would be compromised, as no preservatives are used.\nSince Indonesia has been hit by COVID-19 last March, business has been poor, said Mdm Gusman.\n“Now it is very bad. We are just breaking even.”\n\n\nBefore the pandemic, sales during Chinese New Year would increase tenfold. During\xa0the Hari Raya period, profit would be up 15 times as compared to the usual, she said. \xa0\nHowever, sales were\xa0less than a quarter of the usual during last year's\xa0Hari Raya. She\xa0had to let go of about\xa0half of her 20 staff.\nEven though this year’s Chinese New Year is predicted to be more subdued than usual\xa0due to COVID-19, Mdm Gusman hopes her loyal patrons will still buy her lapis legit.\n“They usually buy the cake three days before Chinese New Year. So hopefully this year they will still come.”\nRead this story in Bahasa Indonesia here.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Indonesia ', '     Jakarta ', '     business ', '     food ', '     Chinese New Year ']}"

      Whip up a feast this Chinese New Year with recipes from Singapore’s society ladies
  </h1>, 'text': 'It’s that time of the year again when the family gathers to exchange good wishes for the new year and feast on scrumptious food. Though this year’s home visits\xa0may be limited to just eight guests per day, you’ll still want to prep your table with an array of delectable dishes that will impress your relatives and friends.\nIf you’re in need of inspiration, here are five recipes from Singapore’s society luminaries.\nDR JADE KUA’S CURRY CHICKEN\n“Curry is a mainstay of my husband, Emil’s, Peranakan household. This recipe has been in his family for at least five generations. His grandmother would procure\xa0the spices at the market and sun-dry them at home. Emil has since continued this tradition.\xa0\n""Even when we lived in Tiong Bahru, you would find a canvas splayed out in the back alley with all his curry spices catching the sun. The spices would be sent to a mill and the powdered\xa0mix would be packed and then distributed among\xa0family and friends.\n""Last year, Emil decided to go an extra mile to research the provenance of the spices, look at milling options and\xa0have them properly packaged. The lockdown happened and he remained in Malaysia, so he set up a Facebook and Instagram page @grannyscurrypowder, opened it to the public\xa0and all followers who wrote in were mailed a sachet for free.\xa0\n""We got a lot of positive feedback and were happy that people got to try and do something with us over lockdown,” shared Dr Jade Kua, a paediatric emergency specialist.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 small chicken, cut into similar sized pieces1 clove of garlic300g shallots2 slices of galangal1 thumb of fresh turmeric3 stalks of lemongrass2 potatoes, peeledQuarter head of cauliflower4 okra2 eggplants\xa01l\xa0coconut water,\xa0coconut milk, water or milk (or any combination)\nPREPARATION\n\n\nDR KAREN SOH’S HOMEMADE LUXURIOUS XO SAUCE\n“I chanced upon this recipe for Luxurious XO sauce on Chubbyhubby.net. The scallops I use are hand-carried from Japan. Instead of standard ham, I use Iberico ham from Spain. It takes a long time to make the sauce, from all the prep work to frying which takes a lot of work, hence I only do it once a year!\xa0\n""To me, this Luxurious XO sauce reflects good luck (because of the red colour), health and blessings. My favourite go-to dishes to pair with this sauce are carrot cake, mee pok and stir-fried vegetables,” said Dr Karen Soh, medical director of Prive Clinic.\nINGREDIENTS\n225g dried scallops200g dried shrimp200g shallots, peeled and coarsely chopped10 garlic cloves, peeled and coarsely chopped150g fresh red chillies, de-seeded and coarsely chopped400ml peanut oil100g dark brown Muscovado sugar100g streaky bacon, finely minced\nPREPARATION\n\n\nFANTY SOENARDY’S KUEH LIDAH\n""Kueh Lidah, or sometimes known as Lidah Kuching, is an Indonesian cookie similar to meringue. Its main ingredient is egg white. During the Chinese New Year festive season, I usually bake Kueh Lapis for my close friends. As only egg yolk is needed in this cake, I’ll use the leftover egg white to bake the Kueh Lidah cookies. I can adjust the sweetness level, and the cookies have a sweet fragrance and a crisp texture. They instantly melt\xa0in your mouth,” said Fanty Soenardy, a homemaker.\nINGREDIENTS\n260g sugar550g butter500g self-raising flour200ml egg white100g grated cheddar cheese\nPREPARATION\n\n\nKELLY KEAK’S ABUNDANCE AND PROSPERITY POON CHOI \n“Poon choi is an auspicious one-pot dish served in a very big pot during festive periods, especially during Chinese New Year. I specially prepare this as a pre-Chinese New Year celebration and for my mum’s birthday.

      Delicious discussions: How the unique recipes of Michelin Guide Kitchen Takeover came to be
  </h1>, 'text': ""In a first ever initiative by Michelin Food Guide Singapore, with support from GrabFood and Singapore Tourism Board, diners in Singapore can now experience a never-before-seen menu exploding with a medley of creative flavours.\nComprising four chef pairings from both Michelin Plate restaurants and Bib Gourmand street food establishments, the Michelin Guide Kitchen Takeover is a pop-up event via GrabFood that lets diners enjoy a unique menu that draws out each kitchen’s signature heritage.\nThe event is inspired by the successful inscription of Singapore’s hawker culture on the UNESCO list of Intangible Cultural Heritage, and represents an opportunity to explore the common language of culinary finesse in hawker food and fine dining cuisine.\nSaid Mr Nicolas Achard, managing director of Michelin Food & Beverage Asia: “The Michelin Guide has always been focused on driving unforgettable experiences for all. We believe that this collaboration would not only bridge the gap between fine cuisine and hawker food, but also be a vessel in the promotion of creativity and food culture in Singapore.”\nThe first two collaborations between Thevar and KEK, and Yen Yakiniku and Chef Kang's Noodle House, were a smashing success. Boasting innovative dishes like Spiced Curry Leaf and Coconut Chutney Cereal Prawns, and BBQ Dream Duo ‘Shuang Ping’ of Char Siew and A5 Omi Wagyu with Homemade BBQ Sauce, the limited sets were sold out in a jiffy. Two more unusual menus await, from Cure and Man Man, and Akira Back and Song Fa Bak Kut Teh.\nCURE X MAN MAN: FINDING COMMON GROUND\nTo create a menu that speaks of two separate chefs is never simple, and even more so when the cuisine in question is distinctly different. But in the case of the partnership between Japanese restaurant Man Man and Irish restaurant Cure, it was easier than expected. After all, Cure’s Chef Andrew Walsh had long discovered a commonality with Man Man’s Chef Teppei Yamashita when he arrived in Singapore in 2011.\n“I recall stumbling upon Chef Teppei’s eponymous omakase joint at Orchid Hotel and being amazed by the intricate flavours and by his style, which is what I look out for in my own cuisine as well,” he said. “From then on, we’ve always known we have a great deal of culinary similarities despite our cultural differences. We were both excited to collaborate after years of knowing each other.”\nFor the Michelin Guide Kitchen Takeover, the Keong Saik Road neighbours have created an exciting menu that speaks intimately of their native produce, such as the Silverhill Farm Duck Takoyaki that features the rare hybrid duck enriched with unagi glace and katsuobushi. Two other innovative dishes make up the menu: BBQ Unagi and Irish Corned Beef Porridge, and Avonmore Macha Cheesecake. \xa0\nYou can pre-order the Cure x Man Man set from Feb 17 to 20. Delivery will be from Feb 22 to 23, 11am to 3pm. 70 sets only.\nAKIRA BACK X SONG FA BAK KUT TEH: A BALANCED INTERPRETATION\nAll the chefs went onboard this special mashup with a healthy curiosity for experimentation.\nSaid Chef Tomo of Akira Back, who was paired with Song Fa Bak Kut Teh: “Akira Back anchors on bold reinventions, flavourful profiles and original experiences, local ones no less. Thus, this was a great opportunity for us to work with an iconic brand like Song Fa, which has been serving up peppery Bak Kut Teh in its most original form.”\nBoth establishments relished the idea of marrying the local hawker scene with fine dining.\nSaid Chef Tomo: “The art is that the alterations must\xa0create new flavours that still retain the cultural significance and authenticity of the original dish.”\nSecond-generation Song Fa owner\xa0Yeo Zhi Yong agreed. They found the research phase challenging, as they had to “ensure that the dishes proposed –\xa0while reinvented or reconstructed – could bring out their full potential and be served together cohesively”.\nThis led to the conception of wonderfully complex menu items like the Song Fa Bossam, where braised pork belly dances in a brew of apple fennel kimchi, XO sauce, salted vegetables, sweet peanuts and butterhead lettuce.\xa0The meal is complemented with Spicy Pork Maki and Bak Kut Teh Hotteok.\nPre-order the Akira Back x Song Fa Bak Kut Teh set from Feb 24 to 26. Delivery will be on Feb 28, noon to 2.30pm, and from Mar 1 to 2, noon to 2.30pm and 6pm to 9.30pm. 60 sets only.\nTHE MAGIC OF DIALOGUE\nThe partnerships between the chefs have led to new discoveries and perspectives.\nNot only did Chef Andrew from Cure gain new knowledge for the high-quality unagi from Mikawa Isshiki region featured in the menu, he also discovered the Japanese way of utilising an entire eel, using all parts of the eel expertly down to its crispy bones.\nSimilarly, for Yen Yakiniku’s Chef Jones, the collaboration with Chef Kang’s Noodle House was eye-opening.\n“Besides gaining insights into the ingredients and the dish, a big takeaway for us was that in order to whip up a scrumptious traditional dish like wanton mee, it requires multiple skills and being detail-oriented,” said Chef Jones. “From the noodles, wanton, char siew, soup, chilli and even the pork lard, everything needs to taken care of!”\n“Some people feel that a bowl of wanton mee priced at S$6 is expensive compared to Japanese ramen and Italian spaghetti that sell at S$18. I feel that this is a matter worthy of discussion,” mused Chef Jones.\nFind out more about the exciting menus from the Michelin Guide Kitchen Takeover.\nThe Michelin Guide Kitchen Takeover is ongoing until Feb 26. Limited sets are available for viewing on the Michelin website\xa0and you can place your pre-orders on your GrabFood app.\nMenu subject to change due to availability of\xa0ingredients.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     hawker culture ', '     dining ', '     food ', '     Song Fa Bak Kut Teh ']}"

      Love letters and plain bak kwa too boring? Try these unique Chinese New Year treats
  </h1>, 'text': ""We are all partial to our own Chinese New Year food traditions, whether it is lining up for bak kwa from a specific brand, ordering pineapple tarts from our favourite store or baker, or drinking orange soda to wash down the reunion meal.\nGiven everyone's unique preferences,\xa0gifting food and drink during the festive season can be a challenge. After all, you want your recipient to like their gift enough to make precious stomach space for it. Enter the bevy of unconventional Chinese New Year treats that just get more abundant and creative each year.\nWe ate our way through them and picked out a few to suit various giftees and occasions.\nFOR THE FUSSY FOODIE: CNY MIXED PASTRY BOX FROM TIGERLILY PATISSERIE\nFollowing the closure of the Michelin-starred Vianney Massot Restaurant in the middle of last year, its young pastry chef Maxine Ngooi began selling pastry boxes from her online bakery Tigerlily Patisserie.\nFor Chinese New Year, she has created a box of five special pastries with distinctly oriental flavours. These include an upside down pineapple cake kissed with whiskey, a black sesame mochi brownie, a milk bun stuffed with dried shrimp sambal, a char siew-filled “moneybag” made of filo pastry, and a laminated brioche swirled with dried Dongguan sausages and caramelised onions. These boxes (S$40) make for lovely, not-quite-traditional edible gifts.\n\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bFOR THE GLUTEN INTOLERANT: GLUTEN-FREE SALTED EGG YOLK PINEAPPLE TARTS FROM SIMPLE INDULGENCE\nGluten-sensitive folks can now have their pineapple tarts, and with salted egg too. This boutique pastry shop makes addictive salted egg yolk pineapple tarts (S$36 for 13 pieces) with a blend of flours including potato and tapioca starch. There are also Egg Free Lucky Pops (S$28\xa0for 210g), which are essentially cookies in an assortment of Japanese matcha almond, coconut, and Maldon sea salt flavours.\nFOR THE PASTRY ANGLOPHILE: MINI MANDARIN ORANGE MARMALADE TARTLETS FROM PAUL \nThese tarts (S$28 for a box of eight) taste as good as they look. Layered with mandarin orange jelly, milk chocolate crunchy pearls, mandarin orange mousse and almond cream, these petite bites are encased in delightfully buttery sable pastry shells.\nPaul is also selling a selection of mini croissants (from S$18 for a box of eight) for the season in flavours like pumpkin floss with seaweed and mayo, bak kwa with bechamel and mozzarella, and hae bee hiam made with spicy sakura shrimp and kaffir lime.\xa0\nFOR THE HOSTESS WHO HAS EVERYTHING: TWG GREEN OF FUJIAN TEA\nShe’s cooked reunion dinner and made all the festive pastries by hand. The last thing you want to give that adept home cook is a (gasp!) store-bought edible. Best to gift something rare for her to cherish, like this limited edition green tea (S$48) grown on a remote garden in the Tai Fu Mountain of Fu Ding in Fujian Province especially for TWG Tea.\nWith its downy jade-hued leaves that brew to yield hints of honey and night-blooming jasmine, it is just the ticket for your host or hostess who no doubt deserves a quiet moment with this exceptional cuppa.\nFOR THOSE WITH PORK FATIGUE:\xa0\xa0CHICKEN BAK KWA AND HONEY MUSTARD ROAST CRACKERS FROM THE MARMALADE PANTRY\nPork is a major protein at Chinese New Year – just look at those queues for bak kwa. But that doesn’t mean that your friends who don’t like it should miss out on the good stuff.\nCheck out The Marmalade Pantry’s chicken bak kwa (S$30 for 250g), individually packed in \xa0petite slices for easy serving. Made from minced chicken thigh and a marinade anchored in lots of fish sauce, the smoky chicken jerky is a worthy alternative to its porcine original.\nAlso addictive is the restaurant’s honey mustard roast crackers (S$20 for 200g) made from soybeans and tossed in tangy honey mustard. They were so crisp and tasty, it was hard to stop at, well, some.\nFOR THE KETO-LOVING GYM RAT: CASHEW COOKIES AND PECAN COCONUT TART FROM SERIOUSLY KETO\nLife on a ketogenic diet can’t be easy for sugar lovers, so thankfully, there’s Singapore’s first fully ketogenic bakery, Seriously Keto. Keto-practitioners don’t have to sit out the festive bingeing now that it has introduced cashew cookies (S$19.80) which are both sugar and gluten free. If you’re taking dessert to a party, there’s the Pecan Coconut Tart (S$88.80), complete with gold leaves to justify its auspicious price tag.\nFOR THAT VERY EXTRA FRIEND: LUCKY FORTUNE ORANGES FROM THE DELI AT GOODWOOD PARK HOTEL\nWe all have that friend – the one for whom a carton of auspicious mandarin oranges just isn’t enough. So why not a crate of mandarin oranges made of cake instead? Every Chinese New Year, Goodwood Park Hotel busts out imaginative 3-D cakes – if memory serves, the past years have given us gold-dusted mice-shaped tarts, a bright red fondant cake with sakura flowers, and a golden pineapple cake.\xa0\nThis year, the orange cakes are comparatively toned down (not a gold flake in sight!). Think kumquat butter cakes layered with vanilla buttercream and artfully enrobed in orange fondant. Huat ah! But make it understated.\nFOR THE CNY REBEL: BAK KWA PINEAPPLE TARTS FROM OLD SENG CHOONG\nWhat? Black at Chinese New Year? Choy! But then again, these are pineapple tarts flecked with bits of bak kwa and kissed with Parmesan cheese, which give them a lovely umami depth. Their ingot-shaped exteriors are dusted with gold (making them less unlucky, if you’re a traditionalist), while their insides feature a just-sweet-enough pineapple jam. Never mind if you’re tempting fate with their black hue, these taste pretty damn good.\xa0\nFOR THAT GET-TOGETHER YOU’VE BEEN DREADING: COCKTAILS FROM JEKYLL & HYDE\nDo yourself a favour by buying a couple of fancy cocktails and making it a point to take a swig every time someone asks why you’re still single, childless, jobless or gay. The Bak Kwa OF (S$39, serves two) has all the flavours of your favourite barbeque pork jerky brightened with caramel miso, homemade spiced butters and “butter bak kwa-washed bourbon”.\nAlternatively, there’s the gin-based Mandarin Gallery (S$39, serves two) made with mandarin honey and orange bitters that will wash away the bitter taste of all that intrusive questioning.\nFOR THE, AHEM, OLDER FRIEND: PINEAPPLE TART MILK KEFIR FROM LE VYR\nToo much festive feasting takes a toll on your belly. To keep your gut healthy and happy with the quintessential flavours of Chinese New Year, wash those treats down with a bottle of pineapple tart milk kefir (S$15.50 for 500ml).\nKefir is a probiotic-rich fermented milk drink that tastes much like yoghurt, but in more drinkable form. Le Vyr’s version is fermented over three weeks and infused with citrus throughout its various stages of fermentation which yields a rich, aromatic brew.\xa0\xa0\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Chinese New Year ', '     food ']}"

      More than 3,000 chickens from Malaysia dead due to hot weather, checkpoint congestion: Poultry importers
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: More than 3,000 chickens\xa0died during their journey from Malaysia to Singapore over the last few days after cargo trucks experienced delays at the land entry checkpoints, said poultry importers interviewed by CNA.\nCargo truck drivers have been experiencing longer than usual delays\xa0at both Tuas and Woodlands checkpoints since last week after\xa0Singapore\'s Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) announced that\xa0COVID-19 antigen rapid testing\xa0would be progressively rolled out.\xa0Drivers would need to test negative\xa0before being allowed to enter Singapore.\xa0\nMs Wu Xiao Ting, a\xa0spokesperson from Singapore\'s Poultry Merchant\'s Association said around 3,500 chickens died during the journey on Wednesday (Jan 27) and Thursday.\n""The congestion has\xa0been bad over the last two\xa0days ... The weather is too hot\xa0and the wait is too long, so they died,"" she said on Friday.\xa0""The congestion has impacted our business.""\nMs Wu said\xa0the chickens were imported using\xa068 cargo trucks. They were scheduled to be\xa0transported to different slaughterhouses before being sold to\xa0retailers across Singapore.\xa0\n""The ones who died (along the journey) were disposed of. They cannot be delivered to retailers,"" she added.\xa0\nPoultry importer\xa0Toh Thye San Farm said that on Wednesday and Thursday, around 2,000 out of the 60,000 chickens it imported from Malaysia\xa0died during the\xa0journey.\xa0\nThe company\'s director Johnson Toh said cargo trucks\xa0carrying the chickens were delayed between\xa09 hours and\xa011 hours at the land checkpoints.\xa0\n""From what we saw, it was because of the heat. They died from overheating. We cannot sell the chickens once they die.\xa0What we did was we put them aside and reported the incident to the Singapore Food Agency (SFA),"" he said.\xa0\n""HORRENDOUS WAIT"" AT CHECKPOINTS: CARGO DRIVERS\xa0\nTruck drivers from Malaysia who entered Singapore over the last week told CNA that the congestion at the checkpoints worsened after it was announced that\xa0they had to be subjected to COVID-19 antigen rapid testing.\xa0\nLast Friday, hours after the new rules were enforced, CNA reported that some drivers had experienced delays of around three hours at the land checkpoints.\xa0\nHowever, those\xa0who entered Singapore over the last few days said that the wait has been extended to\xa0between 10 hours and 15\xa0hours.\xa0\nMr K Sasikumar, who delivers\xa0fresh fruits and vegetables to wholesalers at\xa0Pasir Panjang Wholesale Centre from Kota Tinggi in Johor, told CNA that he spent around 12 hours in congestion at Tuas Second Link on Thursday\xa0 before clearing immigration.\xa0\n""I arrived on Thursday morning at 4am and only reached Pasir Panjang at 5pm in the evening,"" said Mr Sasikumar.\xa0\n""The wait was horrendous, the worst I\'ve ever experienced in my 15 years working this route,"" said the 54-year-old.\xa0\nHe added that some of the vegetables he was carrying had to be disposed of later because they needed to be stored in cool temperatures.\xa0\n""The weather was hot most of the way so (some of)\xa0the vegetables went bad.""\xa0\nMr Loo Chin Khoong, who transports vegetables from Cameron Highlands to Singapore three times a week, said\xa0he was stuck in a 15-hour jam when he tried to enter Singapore on Wednesday.\xa0\n""I arrived at Woodlands Causeway at around 3am on Wednesday morning, hoping to skip the jam. However, I only cleared at 6pm,"" said the employee of\xa0Sun Yee Chong trading.\xa0\n""It felt like madness. Traffic was at a standstill and we could not go anywhere"" said Mr Loo.\xa0\nSimilarly, Mr Loo said that some of his vegetables were no longer fresh when he delivered them to the wholesalers.\xa0\n""I worry about my next trip and my schedule.\xa0If this continues, I will be on the road constantly and won\'t have any time to rest,"" Mr Loo added.\nIn response CNA\'s queries, a spokesperson from NTUC FairPrice said that there have been delays in deliveries\xa0from across the Causeway but no significant disruption\xa0to its supplies.\xa0\nThe spokesperson said: ""While Malaysia is an important source of food, it makes up less than a third of our total supply of vegetables. We continue to build on and grow this portfolio of diversified sources to ensure a stable source of food at affordable prices for our customers.""\nMoreover, poultry importers\xa0Mr Toh and Ms Wu said that the situation had improved on Friday morning at both the Woodlands Causeway and Tuas Second Link.\xa0\nMr Toh said: ""So far today no issues with the shipments, but we don\'t\xa0know (what will happen) over the next few days ...

Cargo volume has returned to pre-COVID levels and with\xa0the continued closure of Malaysia’s Bangunan Sultan Iskandar\xa0from 7pm to 7am, as well as the upcoming Lunar New Year,\xa0the overall\xa0cargo\xa0volume is now more concentrated at certain times of the day,\xa0leading to traffic bunching.""\nThe authorities also said the COVID-19 testing service provider at Tuas checkpoint\xa0encountered ""IT technical issues"" on Wednesday.\n""As a result, they had to fall back on\xa0manual verification of ART (antigen rapid testing)\xa0results, which added to the clearance time,"" the authorities said.\xa0\nThe issue has since been rectified, and the authorities said they have taken additional measures\xa0to speed up the flow of traffic there.\xa0\nOn the issue of\xa0live poultry shipment delays, ICA-MTI-SFA said they are closely monitoring the situation and added that\xa0""delivery times have since\xa0improved significantly with minimal delays"" on Friday.\n""We will continue to work closely with the checkpoint users to make the clearance process as smooth as possible.\xa0With the expected continued increase in volume in coming weeks, we seek the understanding of companies and users to expect delays and to plan their journey ahead.""\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\n', 'related_topics': ['     Malaysia ', '     food ', '     Singapore Food Agency ', '     COVID-19 ']}"

      Celebrating Chinese New Year at home? You can order pen cai for takeaway
  </h1>, 'text': 'Every Chinese New Year, there are dishes that are an absolute must on the dinner table. Pen cai is one of them. What used to be a peasant dish is now a luxurious pot often filled with top-grade ingredients, from abalone and prawns to roast meats and scallops.\nWith safe distancing measures still being enforced, many are likely to consider having their Chinese New Year celebrations at home. With pen cai orders, restaurants take meticulous care to ensure that the pot remains top-notch until it reaches its destination. Ingredients are usually cooked individually and packed into its vessel as close to delivery or collection time as possible.\nCavaliere Giovanni Viterale, general manager of The Fullerton Hotels and Resorts, says that the pen cai from their Cantonese restaurant Jade is made on the day of collection or delivery. The hotel also has its own fleet of drivers on standby and engages a third-party courier service during peak delivery periods.\n“We recommend consumption on the first day for the best pen cai experience. Customers may also choose to store their pen cai in the refrigerator overnight for safe consumption the next day,” added Viterale.\nFor Min Jiang at Goodwood Park Hotel, the pen cai is first placed in a steel pot before being placed inside a wooden one. This gives the traditional appearance while providing customers with a practical method of steaming the dish before consumption.\n\n\nAccording to a Goodwood Park Hotel spokesperson, the pen cai is prepared “according to the time of pickup or delivery to ensure freshness. We recommend consumption within four hours.”\nSummer Pavilion’s Signature Pen Cai is only available for self-collection from its restaurant at The Ritz-Carlton, Millenia Singapore. The hotel’s director of public relations and marketing communications Nathalyn Fong says that orders have to be made at least three days in advance.\nShe said, “It is best consumed within three hours and should be reheated over a low fire if necessary. If the pen cai needs to be kept for later in the day or the next day, it should be refrigerated after the pot has cooled down.”\nSo don’t worry too much about mushy textures or half-heated pots. We recommend these steaming vessels of goodness for your Chinese New Year feasts.\n\n\nHAI TIEN LO, PAN PACIFIC SINGAPORE\nCantonese restaurant Hai Tien Lo has offered their Premium Wealth Treasures pen cai for the past nine years.\nIt is filled with 15 ingredients such as dried oysters, eight-head whole abalone, sea cucumber, goose web, black moss and dried fish maw.\nThis year, executive chef Ben Zeng added a personal touch with minced pork dumplings, which is not commonplace in the dish.\nHe explained, “My wife is from Dongbei and dumplings are usually comfort food, especially for those returning home after a long time away from their parents. In our family, making dumplings is also a regular bonding activity.” He recommends eating the pen cai within four hours of delivery and not to keep it overnight.\nOrder the Premium Wealth Treasure Pot\xa0(S$508 for six persons, S$788 for 10 persons) from panpacificsingapore.oddle.me\nJADE, THE FULLERTON HOTEL SINGAPORE\nJade restaurant’s Great Treasures Pen Cai has been around for 12 years and its version features pork balls made from scratch using Chinese executive chef Leong Chee Yeng’s special recipe.\nThe rich and flavourful combination also includes ingredients signifying prosperity and abundance such as ten-head whole abalone from South Africa, fish maw, deep-fried fresh beancurd stick, lotus root and stewed pork belly.\nOrder the Great Treasures Pen Cai (S$568 for six pax) at least a day in advance from fullertonhotels.com/fullerton-hotel-singapore/offers/jade-lunar-new-year-goodies-takeaways\nMIN JIANG, GOODWOOD PARK HOTEL\nMin Jiang’s Prosperity Sea Treasures pen cai has been a staple on its Chinese New Year menu for the past 15 years.\nIts wooden container harkens to the dish’s origins where Hakka villagers provided food in giant wooden basins to a fleeing emperor (or general, depending on which story you prefer).\nBesides the usual ingredients such as Australian abalones, Min Jiang’s house-made roast pork, fresh scallops and Tianjin cabbage, this year’s special addition includes eel fish maw.\nAnother new soup dish available for takeaway is the Double-Boiled Abalone Soup With Eel Fish Maw, Handmade Prawn Dumplings And Minced Pork Balls.\nOrder the Prosperity Sea Treasures (S$488, serves six) and Double-Boiled Abalone Soup (S$248, serves six) from minjiangfestive.oddle.me\nSUMMER PAVILION, THE RITZ-CARLTON, MILLENIA SINGAPORE\nThe sumptuous Signature Pen Cai from one-Michelin-starred Summer Pavilion includes fish maw, prickly sea cucumber, goose web, scallop, conpoy, Chinese mushroom and seasonal vegetables in rich brown gravy.\nAvailable for self-collection only.

      In Seoul, this butcher wants to start a Korean barbecue omakase beef culture
  </h1>, 'text': 'It’s hard to fathom that a brand like Born and Bred, which sounds more like a cool denim label, is home to the most premium hanwoo beef in all of Seoul. And, possibly the only building in the world, where every floor is dedicated to pleasuring your palates with meat.\nDecked out in Art Deco style with dark marble, tinted glass and bronze accents, the five-storey complex is a nod to the design ethos of the Roaring Twenties. It stands imposingly, albeit awkwardly, against a tired-looking streetscape of old landmarks, including the famous Majang-dong Meat Market.\nThe man behind this boutique meat operation is Jung Sang-won, 37, who grew up watching his father sell beef at Majang-dong, famous for its meat market and slaughterhouses.\n“My father has been doing business here for over 40 years. Since I was born and raised here, I aptly named the business Born and Bred,” said Jung.\n\n\nMajang-dong is also where Korean hanwoo is sold – a prized meat, highly-regarded for its marbling and flavour. “I love hanwoo not just for its rich flavours and buttery textures, but it brings me back to when my father would come home after work, always bringing back some meat in a bag, and I would grill it for him,” he reminisced.\nGrowing up, Jung and his cousins treated the market like a playground, by having pellet gun- or water pistol fights. Those were good memories for him, but it was also frightful because there was blood everywhere, from the meat.\n“Visitors who came to Majang-dong had the same feeling – that it was a scary place. I wanted to change this perception and show that it was possible to come to here and have a fancy meal in a boutique hotel setting,” he shared.\nJung’s father, on the other hand, wasn’t keen on something so modern, as he felt it should retain the red neon lights that Majang-dong is known for.\n“Through my travels, I felt inspired by the aesthetics of boutique restaurants and bars that have a speakeasy quality, as well as the set design of the movie, Kingsman. So, I worked with my interior designers to recreate something like a gentleman’s club. I personally feel we complement the timelessness and traditions of the neighbourhood,” he affirmed.\nBorn and Bred challenges the perception of a traditional butchery by offering a one-of-a-kind space that features three dining concepts. The first floor, a chic butcher’s lounge, showcases the best hanwoo beef in Seoul. On the second floor, you’ll find a modern casual eatery that takes inspiration from butcher restaurants in the Majang-dong area. The hidden gem is the omakase barbecue bar in the basement, which offers a multi-course beef experience featuring various cuts of melt-in-your-mouth hanwoo beef. This is where you’ll find Jung putting on a spectacular show behind a slick hemispheric counter.\n\n\nBorn and Bred is the first restaurant in Seoul to offer a matkimcharim course that specialises in premium hanwoo beef. Matkimcharim, which means “trust me” in Korean, is akin to a Japanese omakase.\n“I fondly remember my time at a Japanese sushi bar, where the chef was able to sense what type of sushi I wanted, without me having to tell him. I was really touched by the quality of service and decided that I had to try that with beef,” he explained.\nWith access to the best beef in Korea, Born & Bred’s high-end concept is the perfect showcase of what hanwoo has to offer. Jung reveals that his best cuts come from two-year-old female cattle, as they are softer and have a richer taste. According to him, the best part of the cow is the skirt meat, as it has the deepest flavours.\nHe assures that, even though the matkimcharim course will set you back at least US$300 (S$397), you will be getting your money’s worth of beef, at least 600g, in a wide variety of cuts, all lovingly grilled over a smokeless charcoal grill.\nIt doesn’t stop there. Like any traditional Korean meal, there are plenty of sides to savour, from picked vegetables to spring rolls, spicy noodle salads, katsu sandwiches, pho, and much more.\nJung strongly believes that matkimcharim dining will definitely raise the standards of hanwoo cuisine in Korea.\n“Just like how people think of Japan when they think of omakase, it would be great to have people to suggest ‘Ah, we have to go to Korea to have special Korean barbecue omakase beef’. This is my dream!” he enthused.\nAdapted from the series Remarkable Living (Season 3).

      US insurers add food to coverage menu as way to improve health
  </h1>, 'text': 'WASHINGTON: When COVID-19 first swarmed the United States, one health insurer called some customers with a question: Do you have enough to eat?\nOscar Health wanted to know if people had adequate food for the next couple of weeks and how they planned to stay stocked up while hunkering down at home.\n""We\'ve seen time and again, the lack of good and nutritional food causes members to get readmitted"" to hospitals, Oscar executive Ananth Lalithakumar said.\nFood has become a bigger focus for health insurers as they look to expand their coverage beyond just the care that happens in a doctor\'s office. More plans are paying for temporary meal deliveries and some are teaching people how to cook and eat healthier foods.\nBenefits experts say insurers and policymakers are growing used to treating food as a form of medicine that can help patients reduce blood sugar or blood pressure levels and stay out of expensive hospitals.\n""People are finally getting comfortable with the idea that everybody saves money when you prevent certain things from happening or somebody\'s condition from worsening,"" said Andrew Shea, a senior vice president with the online insurance broker eHealth.\nThis push is still relatively small and happening mostly with government-funded programs like Medicaid or Medicare Advantage, the privately run versions of the government\'s health program for people who are 65 or older or have disabilities. But some employers that offer coverage to their workers also are growing interested.\nMedicaid programs in several states are testing or developing food coverage. Next year, Medicare will start testing meal programme vouchers for patients with malnutrition as part of a broader look at improving care and reducing costs.\nNearly 7 million people were enrolled last year in a Medicare Advantage plan that offered some sort of meal benefit, according to research from the consulting firm Avalere Health. That\'s more than double the total from 2018.\nInsurers commonly cover temporary meal deliveries so patients have something to eat when they return from the hospital. And for several years now, many also have paid for meals tailored to patients with conditions such as diabetes.\nBut now insurers and other bill payers are taking a more nuanced approach. This comes as the coronavirus pandemic sends millions of Americans to seek help from food banks or neighbourhood food pantries.\nOscar Health, for instance, found that nearly three out of 10 of its Medicare Advantage customers had food supply problems at the start of the pandemic, so it arranged temporary grocery deliveries from a local store at no cost to the recipient.\nThe Medicare Advantage specialist Humana started giving some customers with low incomes debit cards with either a US$25 or US$50 on them to help buy healthy food. The insurer also is testing meal deliveries in the second half of the month.\nThat\'s when money from government food programs can run low. Research shows that diabetes patients wind up making more emergency room visits then, said Humana executive Dr\xa0Andrew Renda.\n""It may be because they\'re still taking their medications but they don\'t have enough food. And so their blood sugar goes crazy and then they end up in the hospital,"" he said.\nThe Blue Cross-Blue Shield insurer Anthem connected Medicare Advantage customer Kim Bischoff with a nutritionist after she asked for help losing weight.\nThe 43-year-old Napoleon, Ohio\xa0resident had lost more than 45kg about 11 years ago, but she was gaining weight again and growing frustrated.\nThe nutritionist helped wean Bischoff from a so-called keto diet largely centred on meats and cheeses. The insurer also arranged for temporary food deliveries from a nearby Kroger so she could try healthy foods like rice noodles, almonds and dried fruits.\nBischoff said she only lost a few pounds. But she was able to stop taking blood pressure and thyroid medications because her health improved after she balanced her diet.\n""I learned that a little bit of weight gain isn\'t a huge deal, but the quality of my health is,"" she said.\nDavid Berwick of Somerville, Massachusetts\xa0credits a meal delivery program with improving his blood sugar, and he wishes he could stay on it. The 64-year-old has diabetes and started the program last year at the suggestion of his doctor. The Medicaid program MassHealth covered it.\nBerwick said the nonprofit Community Servings gave him weekly deliveries of dry cereal and pre-made meals for him to reheat. Those included soups and turkey meatloaf Berwick described as ""absolutely delicious"".\n""They\'re not things I would make on my own for sure,"" he said. ""It was a gift, it was a real privilege.""\nThese programmes typically last a few weeks or months and often focus on customers with a medical condition or low incomes who have a hard time getting nutritious food. But they aren\'t limited to those groups.\nIndianapolis-based Preventia Group is starting food deliveries for some employers that want to improve the eating habits of people covered under their health plans. People who sign up start working with a health coach to learn about nutrition.\nThen they can either begin short-term deliveries of meals or bulk boxes of food and recipes to try. The employer picks up the cost.\nIt\'s not just about hunger or a lack of good food, said Chief Operating Officer Susan Rider. They\'re also educating people about what healthy, nutritious food is and how to prepare it.\nResearchers expect coverage of food as a form of medicine to grow as insurers and employers learn more about which programmes work best.\nPatients with low incomes may need help first with getting access to nutritional food. People with employer-sponsored coverage might need to focus more on how to use their diet to manage diabetes or improve their overall health.\nA 2019 study of Massachusetts residents with similar medical conditions found that those who received meals tailored to their condition had fewer hospital admissions and generated less health care spending than those who did not.\nStudy author Dr\xa0Seth Berkowitz of the University of North Carolina noted that those meals are only one method for addressing food or nutrition problems. He said a lot more can be learned ""about what interventions work, in what situations and for whom"".\nA lack of healthy food ""is very clearly associated with poor health, so we know we need to do something about it"",\xa0Berkowitz said.\n', 'related_topics': ['     health ', '     food ']}"

      Commentary: Kimchi controversies and culture wars: What’s South Korea’s and China’s beef?
  </h1>, 'text': 'SEOUL: Hamzy, a South Korean YouTube personality, has amassed more than 5.3 million subscribers by posting videos of herself eating.\nA recent YouTube video starts with her unboxing a delivery of fried chicken smeared in multicoloured sauces.\nThroughout much of the video, there is little audio besides her breathing, biting and swallowing. Hamzy layers sound effects over those sounds to exaggerate the chicken’s crispness and the crunch of each of her bites.\nThen, she pairs the chicken with kimchi.\nKimchi, a dish of vegetables fermented after having been marinated in salt, shrimp paste and red pepper, have come under the spotlight.\nConsumed as a side dish with nearly every meal in Korea, kimchi is depicted as both a\xa0 superfood and the pride and joy of Korean culture.\nKoreans returning home from abroad often eagerly dig into kimchi as the first thing they eat after landing.\nHamzy’s videos don’t appear in any way political or likely to engender controversy. However she recently got herself into a pickle in a comments section, where she appeared to take sides in a roiling dispute between Chinese and South Korean netizens over the origins of kimchi.\nBEGINNINGS OF A FOOD FIGHT\nAll Hamzy did was click “like” on a comment complaining that some Chinese social media personalities were appropriating Korean dishes. In referring to the Chinese, the comment used a crass Korean word.\nHamzy was quickly accused of hurting the feelings of Chinese netizens and was dropped from the agency that represents her in China.\xa0\nThis wasn’t the first. Korean netizens were incensed by several incidents this month, including popular Chinese food vlogger Li Ziqi uploading a video on how to make kimchi.\nSeparately, the Chinese ambassador to the United Nations tweeted pictures of his homemade kimchi earlier this month.\xa0\nBoth these prominent personalities did not identify kimchi as a Korean dish, which is what most Korean netizens took issue with.\nTheir ire appears to have been building since December, when China acquired certification from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) for pao cai, a Sichuanese dish with some similarities to kimchi.\nAn official Chinese news outlet\xa0described the certification as “an international standard for the kimchi industry led by China"".\nHowever, ISO made clear that the standardisation is only for pao cai and does not apply to kimchi.\nSome have suggested that perhaps this spat boiled down to a simple mistranslation. Korean kimchi is often served in China, and is also referred to as “pao cai”.\nSOUTH KOREA’S INSISTENCE ON WHO OWNS WHAT\nWhen it comes to pressure-point issues of who gets to claim ownership of something that carries some historical significance, Koreans can be quite passionate.\nTheir insistence on convincing the world of what they see as history has partial origins in Korea’s position\xa0as a smaller country located between bigger powers, and a national narrative of Korea getting repeatedly victimised, particularly throughout the 1910 to 1945 colonial occupation by Japan.\nAnyone who has ridden the train from South Korea’s main airport in Incheon into Seoul has had to sit through a video informing passengers of the history of the Dokdo islets.\nThose rocky outcroppings in waters off the eastern coast of the Korean peninsula are also claimed by Japan, where they are called Takeshima.\nThe slickly produced video stridently describes Japan’s claims as baseless.\xa0\nIn this context, even small infractions can feel like a challenge to sovereignty when national pride feels at stake.\nAnd in this case, the kimchi controversy has been internationalised. On Monday (Jan 17), as the kimchi controversy raged, a South Korean professor took out a full-page advertisement in the New York Times featured a tidy pile of kimchi beneath a message describing kimchi as an “iconic food of Korea,” while pointing out that UNESCO listed the culture of making kimchi as an item of intangible cultural heritage in 2013.\xa0\nWhile the advertisement does not mention China, the subtext was obvious. The final line of text, in bold for emphasis, reads:\nKimchi is Korean, but it belongs to everyone.\nZenKimchi, a Korea food blog, called this week’s New York Times advertisement “awkward” while adding, “I understand why it\'s being done. China is trying to claim a kimchi-like pickled cabbage as its own. China, don\'t you have claim to enough things? Let Koreans have kimchi.”\nLET’S EAT IN A CLIMATE OF CIVILITY\nHamzy appears to have weathered the controversy and is continuing to create content and eat kimchi.\nA few days ago, she uploaded a statement to her YouTube account where she apologised for any misunderstanding, clarifying that she did not intend to endorse any harsh or insulting comment about Chinese people.\nShe added that her videos get thousands of comments and sometimes she scrolls through them “liking” without reading thoroughly.\nHowever, on the crucial question of which country gets to claim kimchi, Hamzy doubled down, writing that of course she believes kimchi is Korean and that, “If to work in China I have to say that kimchi is Chinese food, then I won’t work in China.”\n“Also, there is no need for Chinese people who want to work in Korea to say that Chinese foods are Korean. I think Chinese people will understand that.”\nPerhaps this issue was much ado about nothing? While a line in the sand must be drawn when it comes to insulting nationalities of people and stoking hate, the issue isn’t as zero-sum as the fire and fury online suggest.\nKimchi and pao cai are distinct dishes and there is no reason to lump them together. China’s Sichuan province has an illustrious culinary history, distinct from Korean cuisine.\nThe Chinese media’s claims that China leads the “kimchi industry” is true in the sense that the country is the world’s largest producer of kimchi.\nBut making such a claim without noting that kimchi is a Korean dish has been clumsy at best, and at worst, may even have been intended to fire up nationalist fervour.\nBetter than making unfounded claims would be to encourage the people of both countries to enjoy each other’s food in a climate of civility.\nOtherwise, next time things could really go sour.\nSteven Borowiec is a writer, journalist and broadcaster based in Seoul.\n', 'related_topics': ['     South Korea ', '     China ', '     food ']}"

      Who is the mastermind behind the world’s first sustainable sushi restaurant?
  </h1>, 'text': 'Miya’s Sushi may be a little family-run hole in the wall, but this Japanese diner in New Haven, Connecticut, is the proud recipient of the 2016 White House Champions of Change Award for its sustainable practices. In fact, it prides itself as being the first sustainable sushi restaurant on Earth, and is today one of three most sustainable restaurants in the United States.\nThis is all thanks to Chef Bun Lai, whose passion for the environment and social activism made him reinvent the world of sushi to promote ethical eating.\n“The human appetite has been the most destructive force on earth. It’s directly related to the extinction of other creatures. We eat too many animals, particularly farmed animals and fish that is not fished in a way that is ethical,” he said.\nHis intention for Miya’s is to imagine a cuisine that is healthier for the body and the planet.\n\n\n“Food is the most intimate thing because you’re putting something from the outside into your body and ultimately it feeds every cell in your body, that food becomes you,” he waxed lyrically.\nMiya’s, which Bun runs together with his mother and sister, opened in 1983 as a catering business serving Kyushu-style recipes, and gradually became New Haven’s first traditional sushi restaurant.\nBy the late 90s, its menu had become 80 per cent plant-based, and traditional sweetened white rice was replaced with a whole grain brown rice-based blend. One of its most famous creations is the sweet potato roll – a vegetarian’s equivalent of the California Roll.\nIn 2001, Bun initiated the removal of seafood that was caught or farmed in a way that was detrimental to the long term wellbeing of the harvested species or its habitats. In other words, all your sashimi favourites from classic salmon and shrimp to tuna and yellowtail were no longer served.\nThis caused a major paradigm shift in the way sushi was consumed. And not everyone was happy about it.\n“We have guests who come in and run out the door before they even try our food because it’s not what they expect sushi to be. They wanted tuna and everything else that we didn’t carry,” shared Bun. “Or just a classic shrimp roll,” added his sister, Mie.\nThe new possibilities that Bun speaks passionately about are the invasive species that he incorporated to the menu in 2005. But what exactly are they? Aliens? Close, actually. Invasive species are defined as plants or animals that are not native to a specific location, often introduced from overseas, and which have a tendency to spread to a degree that may pose harm to the local ecosystem.\nMiya’s invasive species menu was created in order to take pressure off of popular over-fished species, by utilising ones that are abundant but ecologically destructive.\n“Because of climate change, we’re gonna have vast famines in the world, so the idea is to cultivate invasive species that are already there that you cannot possibly get rid of,” he explained.\n“The next level for a chef is to be well-versed in sustainability. How are the recipes you’re making impacting the people you’re cooking for, [and also] everything else on the planet?”\nWhatever is served on the menu is foraged by Bun and his sister, who spend Sundays and Mondays fishing for edible finds around the estuaries of Long Island Sound. It’s not unusual to see them flipping rocks to find small crabs and sea snails, diving for seaweed, or casting a net to catch smelt.\nThe son of Chinese and Japanese immigrants, Bun’s love for science, nature and foraging was cultivated by his parents from an early age. He even keeps a garden dedicated to wild plants which he harvests farm-to-table style. Some of his favourite greens to use for sushi include wild lettuce, sorrel, nettle, mustard garlic, and mugwort.\n“Wild plants are exponentially more nutritious than anything we can possibly grow. Weeds like these can withstand the fluctuation of weather patterns that are unpredictable,” he revealed.\nIn addition to seafood, you’ll also find grasshoppers, larvae and mealworms on Miya’s menu.\n“If you’re gonna eat an animal, there’s nothing healthier for you and the environment than to eat a wild insect like this!” he enthused, biting into a live grasshopper.\n“When we try to change our ways to a better way, one that is more restorative and nurturing to nature and other people, I can’t think of anything more important to do. And I think we’re doing it in a tiny little way,” he attested.\n“Miya in Japanese means shrine, a holy space where spirits and holy objects are kept. So we’ve always felt that way about Miya’s. That it wasn’t just food that we’re doing, that we’re doing so much more than that,” he concluded.\nAdapted from the series Remarkable Living (Season 3).

      Il Lido’s Beppe de Vito on the art of pivoting and that Gemma incident
  </h1>, 'text': 'We spoke to Giuseppe de Vito in December 2020 to write a story about survival. It was about bobbing and weaving past the punches that COVID-19 had showered upon his clutch of six F&B establishments. After all, the Il Lido Group has seen its fair share of battering in the 14 years since it was founded.\nFor starters, if you think the pandemic was the critical blow that nearly knocked his restaurants off their feet, try being evicted just three months after renewing a restaurant’s lease and spending S$1.2 million on renovations. That’s what happened in January 2019 to Osteria Art, the popular but now defunct establishment in the CBD.\n“The building got bought over and the new owners wanted to do something else with it. So they kicked everyone out. We hadn’t amortised our investment and now had to somehow spend more money to move this project elsewhere. And that’s how we came up with the idea of moving Art into the fifth floor here,” said de Vito (better known as Beppe), referring to the National Gallery where we sat down to coffee one cloudy morning.\nDe Vito’s duplex concepts in the National Gallery have gone through several transformations since they opened in 2015. The establishment on the fifth floor was first branded Aura Restaurant, while the lounge above it was called Aura Sky Lounge. Time soon told that positioning both establishments under the same brand was a problem since the Sky Lounge primarily peddled events.\n“With events, you have a host who books the space and decides what to serve for the occasion. We got all kinds of requests (which we ceded to) and guests at those events thought that’s the kind of food we serve at the restaurant. So of course they didn’t think highly of the restaurant even though they hadn’t actually tried it,” explained the 44-year-old. “We realised that the only way was to split the brands and call it something else.”\nThat is how Aura became Art. But just four months later, the pandemic arrived.\n\n\nCASH-STRAPPED BUT CREATIVE\nLike numerous other F&B companies, Il Lido had to let go of a number of employees and initiate pay cuts for those that remained. Borrowing money, something he’d never had to do before the pandemic, suddenly became a stark necessity.\nDe Vito joked, “I finally had to see what it looked like to borrow money from the banks. Which is not so bad, after all.”\nTo generate cash during the first few months of the pandemic, the company sold its multi-million-dollar stock of wine at cost. “We sold about S$800,000 worth, which could have generated another million, which means we lost a million right there. We practically gave it away because we had to monetise the stock at that time. So our friends got some fantastic wines at a steal!”\nWith events no longer viable, the Sky Lounge’s light-filled dining overlooking the Padang sat languishing. Transplanting Art to this gorgeous space was a no-brainer but it still left the company with an empty restaurant on the fifth floor.\n“We couldn’t just wait and see what would happen, so we looked at our options and thought about what we could do that wouldn’t cannibalise our existing brands. We wanted something that’s a destination, so that the cheques could be higher,” he explained. “So we came up with the idea of good Italian steakhouse.”\nAnd that’s how Gemma Steakhouse was born.\nTHE GEMMA INCIDENT\nGemma is the spanner that was thrown into this story’s otherwise smooth-sailing narrative. Shortly after our interview, the restaurant was ordered to suspend operations for 20 days after it breached COVID-19 regulations by hosting a private Halloween dinner attended by about 75 people.\n\n\nWhat should have been a story of dogged success quickly turned into a question mark about whether a business should be storied for breaking the rules.\nWhen we asked de Vito about the incident, he responded with a mea culpa: “That evening we collaborated with a private member’s club as our marketing and reservations partner to introduce their database to our restaurant. We took individual table reservations of up to five guests per table from both their members and members of the public, (with) safe management measures planned.\n“We, however, fell into this grey area where there’s no clear definition that using an external database to market a themed dinner via a marketing partner constitutes an ‘event’, and that regrettably got us into this situation.\n“We are definitely cognisant that we could have done better to manage the intermingling of guests, and we fully accept the decision of the authorities on this matter. We are going to do better, as we always try to do, and push forward to make positive changes and move on with our businesses.”\nGemma has since re-opened.\nNow that Art has moved to its airy new location, de Vito is reaching for the stars. “In all senses of the word,” he smiled.\nThe change has been good for the restaurant, especially now that Singaporeans are effectively grounded and starved of beautiful destinations to visit. De Vito reports a regular clientele who returns often for the ravishing view, warm service and consistently good and elegant food.\nWhile the restaurant is still open for events, it will now do so on its own terms, which means no customising of menus or the space to a host’s whims. “We may have to decline some business, but we want people to know that they can come here for a special occasion and book ahead.” One imagines that the intermingling of guests will no doubt be better managed, too.\nNext on the cards is, surprisingly, a fast food concept. But one, unsurprisingly, with a fine-dining pedigree. Hamburger bar Carne is a joint venture with Argentinean chef Mauro Colegreco, the man behind the World’s Best Restaurant, Mirazur.\n\n\nThis too emerged from the ashes of the Circuit Breaker when de Vito and Colegreco had planned an online pop-up for Carne in Singapore.\n“During the planning, we realised that there are people who actually do things slower than the Italians – that would be the Argentines,” he laughed. “Three months into it, we were still trying to agree on how or when to do the pop-up. [Since Singapore has opened up], we might as well plan to do a physical restaurant”.\xa0 \xa0\nWhen it opens along Amoy Street in February, Carne will apply fine dining principles to the fast-food experience.\n“It’s the first outlet outside of Buenos Aires and focuses on the concept of sustainability. It is called the utopian burger because in that part of the world, it’s about supporting local trade and craftsmen, local bakers, and using grass-fed beef. Here, the operation is centred around sustainability by supporting local businesses, communities and small-scale industries,” said de Vito. There are plans for a second outlet before the end of the year and, subsequently, growth across Asia.\nWhen asked what he’s learnt in the last year and what he hopes to achieve in the new one, de Vito answers without skipping a beat. “I’ve learned that we need to take more time to plan and focus on the path ahead. But I’ve always been hands-on and when you’re so busy, it’s often a question of saying yes or no to something and you just decide quickly. I wish I had more time to detach and think things through more carefully. It’s a luxury that I’ve been trying to implement.\n“What I’ve learnt during this period is that people are noticing quality more. Where people used to be hosted often, now they make their own dining choices and are realising that is if something is good, they want more of it. So now we concentrate on ensuring that our restaurants are in the best shape possible.”\n“We are going to do better, as we always try to do, and push forward to make positive changes and move on with our businesses.” – Beppe de Vito\n', 'related_topics': ['     Singapore ', '     F&B ', '     food ', '     Restaurants ', '     business ', '     COVID-19 ', '     Profiles ']}"

      When restaurant savoir faire meets local street food flair

In a world-first, the gourmand guide also accorded Hawker Chan and Hawker Tang a Michelin star each for their stalls, which sell soya sauce chicken dishes and pork noodles respectively.\nJust last month, global heritage-officiating body UNESCO added Singapore’s Hawker Culture to its intangible cultural heritage list.\nThe accreditation redefines the boundaries of fine dining and good food. With a four-week pop-up event, the upcoming Michelin Guide Kitchen Takeover will yet again excite with contrasting top chef pairings from restaurant and street food brands.

In the spirit of the SingapoRediscovers campaign, it invites locals to sample two worlds in one sitting, in a three-course sharing menu for two.\nCustomers will have to place orders in advance on the Michelin website or GrabFood app during the pre-order period, where a dedicated page will list the full collaboration and menu details. Each set is priced at S$88, with a flat S$10 delivery fee islandwide.\nLunch and dinner options are available, subject to each collaboration, but avid foodies take note: Sets are limited, so don’t dawdle!\nA DANCE OF FLAVOURS: THEVAR X KEK\nImagine the provocative combination when colourful Indian spices meet the inimitable wok skills of Chinese stir-fry. Could this be the fragrant combination that will fire up your soul?\nChef Mano from Thevar is known for his surprising offerings inspired by his Indian roots and executed with European techniques, while Chef Wayne from KEK is the third-generation member helming the iconic ‘zichar’ restaurant, bringing signature Chinese dishes to the table.\nYou can expect classics enlivened with punchy flavours from the duo – Spiced Curry Leaf and Coconut Chutney Cereal Prawns, Coffee and Caramelised Tamarind Pork Belly, and Pepper Fry Claypot Chicken Rice.\nPre-order the Thevar x KEK set from Jan 18 to 21.

So when a selection offers this through an oceanic and farm platter, you can be sure of a memorable meal.\nCombining the top-shelf wagyu beef of Yen Yakiniku with the marinated char siew and shredded abalone of Chef Kang's Noodle House might seem unlikely, but the two\xa0restaurants share an authenticity to their treatment of food.\nStart with a Yen Special Salad\xa0with Chef Kang's Pulled Abalone, followed by BBQ Dream Duo ‘Shuang Ping’ of Char Siew and A5 Omi Wagyu with Homemade BBQ Sauce. Finish with Wagyu Fat Wanton Noodles – delicate wantons and springy egg noodles topped with wagyu beef fat and crispy pork lard.\nPre-order the Yen Yakiniku x Chef Kang's Noodle House set from Jan 22 to 24. Delivery will be from Jan 26 to 28, 6.30pm to 8.30pm. 80 sets only.\nA RETURN TO SOURCE: CURE X MAN MAN\nFood takes us places, and there’s nothing like heartfelt fare from their country of origin to really let us travel with our taste buds.\nAlthough neighbours along Keong Saik Street Road, the Irish Cure and Japanese Man Man restaurants couldn’t be further apart on the globe. Yet, through their shared focus on quality produce that speak strongly of their native regions, Chef Andrew and Chef Teppei have designed a set that pays tasty homage.\nThe Silverhill Farm Duck Takoyaki features the exclusive hybrid duck with unagi glace and katsuobushi. Then comes the BBQ Unagi and Irish Corned Beef Porridge, with aged Irish beef and toasted unagi bone grains from the Aichi prefecture in Mikawa Town, and Cashel blue cheese. The Avonmore Macha Cheesecake completes as a unique dessert, made of Irish oats cookie and shiso.\nPre-order the Cure x Man Man set from Feb 17 to 20. Delivery will be from Feb 22 to 23, 11am to 3pm. 70 sets only.\nA MEAT REVISITED: AKIRA BACK X SONG FA BAK KUT TEH\nThe beauty of pork is in its versatility. The meat soaks up all kinds of marinades like a dream, yet keeps flavours balanced by retaining its own juicy identity.\nThe chefs at Akira Back and Song Fa Bak Kut Teh are all too familiar with this given their expertise with the protein, and together, they have orchestrated a medley of ingredients to serve up the meat three ways. Investigating into technique and different cuts, this presentation of pork is primed to thrill.\nBegin with the Kurobuta Bossam, where braised pork belly dances in a brew of apple fennel kimchi, XO sauce, salted vegetables, sweet peanuts and butterhead lettuce. It might look familiar but the Spicy Pork\xa0Maki is made with pork tenderloin,\xa0king oyster mushroom and a special spicy sauce. Finally, the Bak Kut Teh Hotteok features premium ribs with a side of handmade pepper dipping sauce.\nPre-order the Akira Back x Song Fa Bak Kut Teh set from Feb 24 to 26.

      A former army cook, he now helms a three-Michelin-starred restaurant in Seoul
  </h1>, 'text': 'Mention Korean nosh and you automatically think of an organised chaos of small dishes that immediately warm our bellies and hearts. Rarely does it give us the impression of pretty, plated creations deserving of three Michelin stars, until we paid a visit to Gaon.\n“Most people think that Korean food is underrated. We wanted to improve on that and tell more people about our cultural heritage in a proper manner,” explained chief executive chef, Kim Byung-jin. And so Gaon was created to promote a better understanding of traditional Korean cuisine in a way that gourmands would appreciate.\n\n\nLocated in the heart of Gangnam at Horim Art Center, Gaon is only one of two fine-dining restaurants in Seoul awarded three stars in the Michelin Guide for both 2017 and 2018. The three-storey space is minimalist in design, almost like the museum it’s situated in, where your only focus is the culinary journey you are about to embark on.\nThe restaurant applies a very farm-to-table approach in its cooking, using only fresh seasonal ingredients sourced from local suppliers. “Korean cuisine is nutritionally well-balanced. To me, it is very healthy and overflowing with charm,” said Kim with a smile.\nDepending on what’s readily available, the set menu will adapt from time to time. Rest assured, there will be evergreen classics like kimchi and seafood pancake. “Once the dish has been created and if there is room for improvement, I make variations of it, instead of removing it after a season,” revealed Kim.\nThrough his dishes, you understand his philosophy and respect for ingredients. “My cooking is all about being responsible to the ingredients. Only through good ingredients are we able to have good food. What chefs handle are primarily ingredients, then comes the skill,” he admitted humbly.\nAfter 20 years in the business – he first started cooking Korean food during his military service, creating daily menus for the Army Chief of Staff’s residence and during official events – Chef Kim has elevated his cooking into an art form where each dish boasts complex flavour profiles deserving of their Michelin stars.\nKim’s seafood dishes, in particular, have received the highest praise for their uplifting flavours. “I grew up in the city’s inland, so it was difficult to come across fresh fish. As I started cooking with fresh seafood, I stepped into a whole new world. The scent, the texture and the taste, everything that I knew about seafood had changed,” he enthused.\nOperated by the KwangJuYo Group, maker of fine ceramic ware and traditional Korean liquor, Gaon’s charm lies in its meticulous presentation of dishes on a wide array of handcrafted crockery, which Kim personally designs.\n“When I was a junior chef, I preferred to use white crockery because there is more room for food decoration. One day, I realised that the best way to decorate Korean cuisine is not to do it. The most important thing is to keep the look of Korean cuisine natural,” he explained.\nAlmost every detail in Gaon is purposeful – the decor, the music selection, the staff’s uniforms – bringing together a certain ideology and aesthetic that the restaurant aspires to achieve.\nTo Kim, the space and factors associated with the whole place affects the diner’s experience and memories.\n“It’s like if you ask anyone who the best chef is, everyone will say their mum. It’s not about the taste, but it’s the memory and the experience that makes food great. That’s the role of an award-winning restaurant.”\nAdapted from the series Remarkable Living (Season 3).

      From fried chicken to K-beauty, he's bringing Korean culture to Singapore
  </h1>, 'text': 'As a former consultant in the IT industry, Luke Yi enjoyed much success in the corporate world, having worked for big names such as Hewlett-Packard and\xa0Cisco Systems. But after 16 years in the industry, Yi found himself listless and bored.\n“The work was very routine,” he lamented. “I was also travelling a lot. More than half of my time was spent on the plane.” \xa0\nBorn in South Korea, Yi migrated to New Zealand at the age of 18. After working in Australia for 10 years, he moved to Singapore.\n“When I was back in town, my time with family was very precious,” shared the 45-year-old father of two. “When you’re busy, every hour is\xa0important. So when you go to a restaurant and find that the place serves good food, but the service level isn’t fantastic, you tend to be disappointed.”\nYi’s dismay at the service standards in Singapore’s F&B scene, coupled with his eagerness to do “something more fun”, sparked the birth of Chicken Up in 2012. When Chicken Up first opened, it was one of Singapore’s first Korean fried chicken chains, sparking a craze.\n“Back then, many of my friends in Singapore thought that Korean food is all about barbecue. But growing up in Korea, I know that there’s a lot more variety. It’s just easier to set up a Korean barbecue restaurant here,” he shared.\n“I chose to do fried chicken because in Singapore, there’s a mix of different races. Some don’t eat beef and some don’t eat pork, so chicken is more commonly accepted.”\nNine years later, Yi’s entrepreneurship journey has seen him expand into the beauty industry with the opening of Korean beauty salon, Leekaja. Marrying both the F&B and beauty worlds, he opened Walking On Sunshine, a hair salon-cum-cafe, in 2018.\nWhile Yi believes there’s a strong appetite for Korean-related experiences in Singapore, “there’s still a lot more to explore,” he said. “I’m here to bring in more Korean experiences, and not just the shell of it, but the entire culture as well.”\n“I’m here to bring in more Korean experiences, and not just the shell of it, but the entire culture as well.” – Luke Yi\nCOOKING UP A STORM\nUnderpinning Yi’s entire entrepreneurial journey is a desire to bring innovation to traditional industries, he shared. When Chicken Up first opened in Singapore, Yi was eager to create an F&B establishment where diners did more than just eat and exit.\n“I was inspired to incorporate the distinctly fun style of Korean service to the Singapore restaurant scene. This way, I was able to acquaint Singaporeans with the idea of Korean culture through the food that we serve, and the Korean hospitality that comes with it,” Yi shared.\n“We created a fun drinking culture at Chicken Up with our flavoured soju drinks such as watermelon, apple and pineapple, which were quite big hits at the time. We also trained our staff according to airline service standards so they would be more welcoming and attentive. We even had an incentive for them to remember the names of our regulars.”\nAfter the success of Chicken Up, Yi opened Korean-Mexican bistro Don’t Tell Mama. While Korean and Mexican food seemed like an odd pairing at the time, it was a popular concept back in Korea. The fusion bistro bar has since become a hit in the Tanjong Pagar area. Yi’s F&B portfolio also includes the now-defunct Korean street food outlet Baro Baro.\nHaving achieved success in the F&B world, Yi was soon in search for a new industry to take on. “The thing with the F&B industry is that customer loyalty is very shallow. If diners like the food, they may come back. But people like to try new restaurants,” he said.\n“I wanted to also to prove to myself that the success of Chicken Up wasn’t just pure luck.""\nSHAKING UP THE BEAUTY INDUSTRY\nBeauty, he believes, is an industry with higher customer retention.\xa0At the time, he felt that the beauty industry in Singapore was in need of a shakeup.\n“When I first came to Singapore, not many people wore make-up. But in Korea, people wear make-up even to go to the grocery store,” he said. “But I knew there was a growing interest in the importance of looking good, so I waited for the right opportunity to go into the beauty industry to make it a little bit more exciting.”\nThat opportunity came in late 2016 when Yi partnered with Korean beauty entrepreneur Madam Leekaja to open the first Leekaja Beauty Salon in Singapore. Leekaja is an established Korean beauty salon chain back in its home country, the first to be franchised worldwide. It now boasts over 200 stores around the world.\n“A long time ago, people were obsessed with Hong Kong culture, and then it was Japanese culture. Now it is Korean culture."" – Luke Yi\nThe Leekaja Singapore website touts a “full Korean beauty experience without having to travel to Seoul”. Located at Mandarin Gallery, it offers not only hairstyling services, but make-up, eyebrow, eyelash and nail services as well.\n“Korea is widely known as one of the leaders in the beauty industry. Singaporeans have also been riding the Korean wave and many are obsessed with K-dramas. Right away, we received a lot of demand and requests for our stylists to recreate hairstyles referenced from K-dramas,” Yi said.\nBeyond hiring Korean hairstylists, the salon prides itself for its customer service standards. “We have three to four customer service officers, and what they do is ensure that customers are happy and satisfied. It’s a heavy investment actually, but at a lot of other places, there’s not enough receptionists, which results in a lot of waiting around.”\nAt Leekaja, customers are seated at their very own spacious stations. It can sometimes take hours to get their hair\xa0done, so guests are given a robe and a pillow for comfort.\nWhile many beauty salons in Singapore tie customers down by pushing the sale of packages, Leekaja prefers to let its experience do the selling. “We don’t sell packages, we never sell packages. We let our customers enjoy the experience and if they value that, they will come back.”\nYi’s latest venture, however, is an innovative hair salon-cum-cafe, aptly named Walking On Sunshine. Located at Orchard Central, the secret garden-themed cafe is shrouded in lush foliage, surrounded with over a thousand potted plants. By the side of the cafe sits an expansive hair salon which offers just about anything from a haircut to a dye job.\nSince its opening in 2018, Walking On Sunshine has attracted a strong following, particularly those eager to snap a photo at one of its Instagram-worthy spots.\xa0\n“I was in the F&B industry and then in beauty, and I always wanted to combine the two together to create a place where people can do many things at once. So take a family spending time together on a weekend. Father and daughter can enjoy a meal while mum gets her hair and nails done. Then they can take turns,” Yi explained.\n“Anyone can say that they’re the top hair salon or cafe in the country, but we actually let our customers experience it. If I tell them a bunch of facts, they will probably not remember it the next few days. But the feeling they felt while being here is something that will last longer.”\nON TO THE NEXT BIG THING\nWith his corporate life a distant memory now, Yi has no regrets about striking out on his own. A self-professed workaholic, Yi believes that the best part of becoming an entrepreneur in the beauty and F&B space is the ability to meet new people every day.\n“When I was in IT, the only people that I hung out with was IT guys,” he laughed. “But now, I get to socialise with different kinds of people, and that was what really pulled me into the service industry.”\nBigger plans are already in the works. He’s currently aiming\xa0towards opening four or five “mega-salons” in the next eighteen months, which will be bigger than what he has already started.\nWhile Walking On Sunshine combines a hair salon with a cafe, one of the upcoming mega-salons will feature a beauty salon, cafe and a pilates studio. “After pilates, visitors can take a shower, then get their hair and makeup done. After that, they can enjoy healthy vegan food at the cafe with their friends. We want to create a space where people can spend hours and hours, without having to travel back and forth.”\xa0\nWhile Yi believes the Korean wave is here to stay for now, he’s aware that things may not be the same in the future. “A long time ago, people were obsessed with Hong Kong culture, and then it was Japanese culture. Now it is Korean culture, but that might change in a few years,” he acknowledged.\xa0\n“But because people can’t travel for now, I think they will look for unique, different experiences. That’s where I hope to spice things up.”\n“Because people can’t travel for now, I think they will look for unique, different experiences.

      How Bangkok’s fine-dining scene defied the odds in 2020
  </h1>, 'text': 'With his ready grin and informal manner, Thitid “Ton” Tassanakajohn deserves his reputation as one of Bangkok’s most laid-back gourmet stars.\nAnd the chef is in typically mellow fettle when I meet him at his newest fine-dining venture, Nusara: An intimate affair a stone’s throw from The Grand Palace, Wat Pho and other storied landmarks in Thailand’s capital.\nDressed down in a combo of black T-shirt and jeans, he treats CNA Luxury to a selection of delicious bites from the Nusara tasting menu – where no-compromise traditional flavours mesh with artful presentation.\nIf he’s stressed about adding to a restaurant portfolio that already encompasses Le Du, his Michelin-starred flagship, and Baan, a family-style dining room specialising in homely Thai fare, he barely shows it.\nIt’s only towards the end of the sitting that he displays even the slightest sign of 2020-style angst. “I’ve got to check in on something down at Le Du,” he said, politely excusing himself. “There’s a lot to take care of at the moment. It’s a silly time to be adding to an empire.”\n\n\nA post shared by ThiTid Tassanakajohn (@cheftonn)\nAs counter-intuitive as it may seem to be launching a new restaurant during a global pandemic that has been poison for F&B businesses around the world, chef Ton is far from the only big-name putting his neck on the line in Thailand\'s capital.\nIn common with other cities around Asia, Bangkok’s dining culture was halted in its tracks by COVID-19. As lockdown bit hard in March 2020, the city’s restaurants were limited to delivery-only – not an ideal showcase for expensive and often mind-bendingly complex, multi-course tasting menus. While restaurants were allowed to open again at the start of June, few predicted that Bangkok’s fine-dining scene would bounce back with such vivacity.\nWhile the pandemic has certainly been catastrophic for some venues – with staff layoffs often a sad reality – it has not caused irreparable damage to the uppermost echelon of the city’s dining scene. Indeed, an already star-studded cast has witnessed the advent of several new contenders. Here’s the inside track on the fresh culinary additions that have brightened up a troubled year.\n\n\nCADENCE AND CAPER\nIn Bangkok, as in the rest of the world, a degree of chest-beating is part and parcel of being a chef.\nA notable exception to this rule is Dan Bark, whose humility has become as much of a trademark as his progressive American cuisine.\nThe Korean/American chef was the surprise package when the Michelin guide launched in Thailand back in 2017.\nIndeed, the single star he earned for Upstairs at Mikkeller came as much of a shock to Bark as it did to a fine-dining audience in Bangkok who were largely unfamiliar with his work at the bijou venue.\n“I couldn’t believe it,” admitted Bark. “I’ve got plenty of faith in my food. But we were doing pairings with craft beer in a tiny room above a bar. I truly didn’t expect that to fly with the Michelin inspectors.”\nBut fly it did, and Bark has since become more comfortable with his lofty position in the firmament of Bangkok chefs. A measure of his assuredness came in 2020 with the unveiling of new twin-restaurant project Cadence and Caper inside a sprawling townhouse in the labyrinthine back streets of the city’s Ekkamai neighbourhood.\nThe pandemic put the opening on hold, but by August 2020 things were in full swing. Cadence, the fine-dining side of the operation, unfolds in a hip and handsome dining room that connects to a showpiece open kitchen.\nDishes are, according to Bark, deeply personal and inspired by his own experiences. For example, creations like Ocean, a starter of fresh oyster with salmon tartare crisp, and Beef, an elevated (think New Zealand wagyu paired with spicy sesame and gochujang-based sauce) take on Korean BBQ, draw on Bark\'s love of the Thai coastline and his Korean heritage.\nOn the other side of the building, Caper offers a more casual dining experience.\xa0 Even so, toasted brioche with Parmesan, truffle cheese and freshly shaved truffle and Hokkaido scallops with cauliflower puree and caper sauce don’t scrimp on Bark’s boundless flair.\nBangkok’s reputation as one of Asia’s fine-dining hubs was already established pre-pandemic. And leading international chefs have seen their projects continue to take flight in Thailand’s capital over the past year.\nAt Capella Bangkok, Cote by Mauro Colagreco is wowing diners with its Riviera-inspired cuisine. Also riverside is Blue by Alain Ducasse, which quickly picked up a Michelin star within its first year of opening.\nAnother celebrity-endorsed venue making waves during a difficult 12 months is IGNIV. After a successful pop-up in 2018, Swiss chef Andreas Caminada opted to make a permanent home for his fine-dining sharing concept at the swanky St Regis Hotel.\nHis decision to make Bangkok the first location for IGNIV outside Switzerland has been a prescient one.\nThai fine-dining lovers are flocking to the sleek dining room –\xa0a space conceptualised by acclaimed Spanish interior designer Patricia Urquiola –\xa0to partake in a dining experience that fuses modern European cuisine with a hands-on sharing ethos that jives with Thailand\'s family-style eating culture.\n“Sharing time and enjoyment is a central element of the experience at IGNIV,” said head chef David Hartwig. “We want to bring people together and create a special place amid the pulsating city life of Bangkok. A place where guests consciously laugh and share the joy of our IGNIV kitchen.”\nTo that end, Hartwig and his German partner in cuisine, pastry chef Arne Riehn, are serving up alchemy in generous portions. Menu highlights range from delicate beef tartare enlivened by finely grated raw hazelnuts and a showstopping dish of fresh smoked Hamachi grilled to tender perfection tableside.\nSweet sensations, meanwhile, include rich chocolate tart served with mango cream and the venue’s signature “candy store” where guests can pick and mix house-made goodies like chocolate bark, fruit jellies and madeleines.\n“We appreciate the deep cultural connection to good food that Thai people have,” added Hartwig. “And our urban but sociable concept fits in very well with the lively atmosphere here in Bangkok.”\nAn ability to pivot has proved to be an invaluable asset for Phattanant “May” Thongthong during the tumultuous past 12 months.\nAt the start of the year, the Chiang Mai-born chef was looking forward with confidence to the unveiling of MAZE Dining, her Bangkok debut.\nStarring displays on television’s Top Chef Thailand and Iron Chef Thailand had earned Thongthong a ready-made fanbase that made the restaurant seem like a sure-fire bet for success. Then came the pandemic.\nLockdown stymied the restaurant’s scheduled March opening: A potentially crushing blow for any new business. But as the crisis unfolded, Thongthong proved herself to be as adaptable as she is affable, temporarily shelving her ambitious seasonal tasting menus and making her more accessible dishes available for delivery.\n“It was an abrupt change,” she recalled. “And it required a fast business decision and execution. It was very challenging, but I’ve come to realise that it was a good lesson. It always pays to be able to cope with whatever the world throws at you.”\nWhen Thailand’s lockdown ended, MAZE Dining got into full swing and Thongthong was able to strut her culinary stuff in a more expansive style. Combining flavour profiles and ingredients from northern Thailand with techniques and presentations from around the world, her creations defy easy categorisation.\nA winter menu, for instance, takes diners on an exhilarating journey around the world. A dish called Truffle Hunt where rich dark chocolate and black-truffle infused sauce combines with hand-cut pasta draws on Thongthong’s experience of working in Piedmont in Italy. Korean and Japanese overtones, meanwhile, can be detected in creations such as wagyu short ribs with gochujang, potato, beetroot and daikon and chawanmushi with Beluga caviar and roasted chilli foam.\n“The name of the restaurant was carefully chosen,” added Thongthong. “I want to take my guests into a maze to discover surprising flavours and interesting stories they won’t experience anywhere else.”\n\n\nA post shared by Nusara (@nusarabkk)\nWhen chef Ton’s grandmother passed away in 2019, he resolved to pay tribute to her in the best way he knew how.\nThe result is Nusara, an intimate (10-person maximum) chef’s table situated in a candlelit dining room above Mayrai: The pad thai slinging natural-wine bar chef Ton operates with Tam, his sommelier sibling.\nA canny distillation of chef Ton’s considerable talents, the tasting menu at Nusara takes cues from a punchy brand of cooking that would be appreciated by even the most critical Thai uncle or auntie while applying fine-dining refinement.\n\n\nA post shared by Nusara (@nusarabkk)\nThis push and pull between old and new, rustic and exclusive, comes to the fore in a succession of beautifully presented dishes. These range from morsels such as cured line-caught grouper enlivened by young ginger, to more substantial plates like a pork jowl curry made with fresh chilli paste and the signature wagyu beef pad krapow – the meltingly tender slices of beef taking the holy-basil and chilli-infused Thai workhorse to transcendent heights.\n“It’s very traditional Thai food,” said chef Ton. “Probably more so than at Le Du, which is why I wanted to showcase them at Nusara. But Thai food is generally served family-style, whereas here I\'ve put more thought into the presentation. I wanted to honour my grandmother, who was a very forward-looking lady.""\n“Thai food is generally served family-style, whereas here I\'ve put more thought into the presentation.

  </h1>, 'text': 'NEW YORK: Until March, when everything started tasting like cardboard, Katherine Hansen had such a keen sense of smell that she could recreate almost any restaurant dish at home without the recipe, just by recalling the scents and flavours.\nThen the coronavirus arrived. One of Hansen’s first symptoms was a loss of smell, and then of taste. Hansen still cannot taste food, and says she can’t even tolerate chewing it. Now she lives mostly on soups and shakes.\n“I’m like someone who loses their eyesight as an adult,” said Hansen, a realtor who lives outside Seattle. “They know what something should look like. I know what it should taste like, but I can’t get there.”\nA diminished sense of smell, called anosmia, has emerged as one of the telltale symptoms of COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus. It is the first symptom for some patients, and sometimes the only one.\nOften accompanied by an inability to taste, anosmia occurs abruptly and dramatically in these patients, almost as if a switch had been flipped.\nMost regain their senses of smell and taste after they recover, usually within weeks. But in a minority of patients like Hansen, the loss persists, and doctors cannot say when or if the senses will return.\nScientists know little about how the virus causes persistent anosmia or how to cure it. But cases are piling up as COVID-19 sweeps across the world, and some experts fear that the pandemic may leave huge numbers of people with a permanent loss of smell and taste.\nThe prospect has set off an urgent scramble among researchers to learn more about why patients are losing these essential senses, and how to help them.\n“Many people have been doing olfactory research for decades and getting little attention,” said Dr Dolores Malaspina, professor of psychiatry, neuroscience, genetics and genomics at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. “COVID is just turning that field upside down.”\nDETACHMENT AND ISOLATION\nSmell is intimately tied to both taste and appetite, and anosmia often robs people of the pleasure of eating. But the sudden absence also may have a profound impact on mood and quality of life.\nStudies have linked anosmia to social isolation and anhedonia, an inability to feel pleasure, as well as a strange sense of detachment and isolation.\xa0\nMemories and emotions are intricately tied to smell, and the olfactory system plays an important though largely unrecognised role in emotional well-being, said Dr Sandeep Robert Datta, an associate professor of neurobiology at Harvard Medical School.\n“You think of it as an aesthetic bonus sense,” Dr Datta said. “But when someone is denied their sense of smell, it changes the way they perceive the environment and their place in the environment. People’s sense of well-being declines. It can be really jarring and disconcerting.”\nMany sufferers describe the loss as extremely upsetting, even debilitating, all the more so because it is invisible to others.\n“Smell is not something we pay a lot of attention to until it’s gone,” said Pamela Dalton, who studies smell’s link to cognition and emotion at the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia. “Then people notice it, and it is pretty distressing. Nothing is quite the same.”\nWEAKENED BONDS\nBritish scientists studied the experiences of 9,000 COVID-19 patients who joined a Facebook support group set up by the charity group AbScent between Mar\xa024 and Sep\xa030.\nMany members said they had not only lost pleasure in eating, but also in socialising. The loss had weakened their bonds with other people, affecting intimate relationships and leaving them feeling isolated, even detached from reality.\n“I feel alien from myself,” one participant wrote. “It’s also kind of a loneliness in the world. Like a part of me is missing, as I can no longer smell and experience the emotions of everyday basic living.”\nAnother said: “I feel discombobulated - like I don’t exist. I can’t smell my house and feel at home. I can’t smell fresh air or grass when I go out. I can’t smell the rain.”\nLoss of smell is a risk factor for anxiety and depression, so the implications of widespread anosmia deeply trouble mental health experts. Dr Malaspina and other researchers have found that olfactory dysfunction often precedes social deficits in schizophrenia and social withdrawal even in healthy individuals.\n“From a public health perspective, this is really important,” Dr Datta said. “If you think worldwide about the number of people with COVID, even if only 10 per cent have a more prolonged smell loss, we’re talking about potentially millions of people.”\n""THE COVID DIET""\nThe most immediate effects may be nutritional. People with anosmia may continue to perceive basic tastes - salty, sour, sweet, bitter and umami. But taste buds are relatively crude preceptors. Smell adds complexity to the perception of flavour via hundreds of odour receptors signalling the brain.\nMany people who can’t smell will lose their appetites, putting them at risk of nutritional deficits and unintended weight loss. Kara VanGuilder, who lives in Brookline, Massachusetts, said she has lost 9kg since March, when her sense of smell vanished.\n“I call it the COVID diet,” said VanGuilder, 26, who works in medical administration. “There’s no point in indulging in brownies if I can’t really taste the brownie.”\nBut while she jokes about it, she added that the loss has been distressing: “For a few months, every day almost, I would cry at the end of the day.”\nPRIMAL ALARM SYSTEM\nSmells also serve as a primal alarm system alerting humans to dangers in our environment, like fires or gas leaks. A diminished sense of smell in old age is one reason older individuals are more prone to accidents, like fires caused by leaving burning food on the stove.\nMichele Miller of Bayside, New York, was infected with the coronavirus in March, and hasn’t smelled anything since then. Recently, her husband and daughter rushed her out of their house, saying the kitchen was filling with gas.\nShe had no idea. “It’s one thing not to smell and taste, but this is survival,” Miller said.\nHumans constantly scan their environments for smells that signal changes and potential harms, though the process is not always conscious, said Dr Dalton, of the Monell Chemical Senses Center.\nSmell alerts the brain to the mundane, like dirty clothes, and the risky, like spoiled food. Without this form of detection, “people get anxious about things”, Dr Dalton said.\nDISTORTED PERCEPTIONS\nEven worse, some COVID-19 survivors are tormented by phantom odours that are unpleasant and often noxious, like the smells of burning plastic, ammonia or faeces, a distortion called parosmia.\nEric Reynolds, a 51-year-old probation officer in Santa Maria, California, lost his sense of smell when he contracted COVID-19 in April. Now, he said, he often perceives foul odours that he knows don’t exist. Diet drinks taste like dirt; soap and laundry detergent smell like stagnant water or ammonia.\n“I can’t do dishes, it makes me gag,” Reynolds said. He’s also haunted by phantom smells of corn chips and a scent he calls “old lady perfume smell”.\nIt’s not unusual for patients like him to develop food aversions related to their distorted perceptions, said Dr Evan R Reiter, medical director of the smell and taste centre at Virginia Commonwealth University, who has been tracking the recovery of about 2,000 COVID-19 patients who lost their sense of smell.\nOne of his patients is recovering, but “now that it’s coming back, she’s saying that everything or virtually everything that she eats will give her a gasoline taste or smell”, Dr Reiter said.\nThe derangement of smell may be part of the recovery process, as receptors in the nose struggle to reawaken, sending signals to the brain that misfire or are misread, Dr Reiter said.\nAfter loss of smell, “different populations or subtypes of receptors may be impacted to different degrees, so the signals your brain is used to getting when you eat steak will be distorted and may trick your brain into thinking you’re eating dog poop or something else that’s not palatable.”\nPOSSIBLE TREATMENTS\nPatients desperate for answers and treatment have tried therapies like smell training: Sniffing essential oils or sachets with a variety of odours - such as lavender, eucalyptus, cinnamon and chocolate - several times a day in an effort to coax back the sense of smell.\nA recent study of 153 patients in Germany found the training could be moderately helpful in those who had lower olfactory functioning and in those with parosmia.\nDr Alfred Iloreta, an otolaryngologist at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, has begun a clinical trial to see whether taking fish oil helps restore the sense of smell. The omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil may protect nerve cells from further damage or help regenerate nerve growth, he suggested.\n“If you have no smell or taste, you have a hard time eating anything, and that’s a massive quality of life issue,” Dr Iloreta said. “My patients, and the people I know who have lost their smell, are completely wrecked by it.”\nReynolds feels the loss most acutely when he goes to the beach near his home to walk. He no longer smells the ocean or salt air.\n“My mind knows what it smells like,” he said. “And when I get there, it’s not there.”\nBy\xa0Roni Caryn Rabin © The New York Times\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\n\n', 'related_topics': ['     COVID-19 ', '     food ']}"

      Everyone eats almonds, walnuts, peanuts – why do we know so little about nuts?
  </h1>, 'text': 'Charles Tebbutt picks up a ripe walnut from the sodden ground. Around us are 120 varieties of walnut tree, planted as an experiment nearly two decades ago. Some have died, some have disappointed and just a few have taken advantage of the Kent soil, to the point where they now throw off tens of kilos of nuts each autumn.\n“These Fernor ones are really, really rich. They’re almost cheesy,” said Tebbutt, an ecologist who sells nuts in London’s Borough Market. He pulls the green husk of another variety of walnut, the Bardwell, from the brown shell, and encourages me to do likewise.\n“Be careful, because it will stain your hands.” My hands are already brown. Is it permanent? I asked.\n“A good couple of weeks.”\nThe Romans used the tannins from walnut husks to dye clothes. They also threw walnuts at weddings as a symbol of fertility, and tried using them to treat baldness. But this wasn’t why I had come to East Malling.\nDiscerning eaters are now practically experts on where much of their food comes from. Nuts, meanwhile, are the treat of which few questions are asked. This year, as the first chestnuts appeared, it occurred to me: I had no idea where or how nuts were grown.\n‘A FOOD OF EDEN’\nI had scoffed a lot of them at cocktail parties. I had thought that nuts were wonderful things: Indulgent but healthy, sophisticated but substantial, fancy but not too fancy to gorge on while watching football.\nBut until I visited the walnut orchard at East Malling Research Station, I would not have recognised a walnut in its husk.\nNor, until I googled it, would I have been able to pick out a group of pistachios growing on a tree.\nI have never stopped to laugh at a cashew tree, whose nut grows on the bottom of a tropical, apple-shaped fruit, looking a bit like genitalia. I never realised that Brazil nuts grow together in pods that weigh up to 2.5kg, which only one animal, a large rodent called the agouti, can gnaw open. (Humans use machetes or axes.)\nIn my defence, it turns out that nuts are barely grown in Britain. Most of ours are imported from California, China, Turkey and beyond. We are surrounded by conkers from horse chestnut trees but the sweet chestnuts we eat come from Italy, France and Spain.\nMost foods have been demonised at some point but nuts are different, said Ken Albala, author of Nuts: A Global History. “I think that’s fundamentally because they’re a food of Eden — they’re unprocessed, they’re nature as it was meant to be.”\nIndeed, we should all be eating more of them, according to the EAT‑Lancet commission, an expert group on healthy, sustainable diets. Nuts do not require much land or create excessive greenhouse gas emissions. A peanut has a higher proportion of protein than a beef burger.\nThe EAT-Lancet “planetary health diet” suggested in 2019 that people should get nearly 300 calories a day from nuts – more than they get from meat and fish. That works out at 50g of ground nuts and tree nuts a day – a handful, or several times the current world average.\nNuts have protein, “good” fat and vitamins. They have crunch and flavour. They are the ideal party guest – the arboreal equivalent of the person who turns up with wine, chocolates and a present for your kids. They are gastronomically extensive and only sometimes astronomically expensive.\nBEFORE MADNESS IT WAS FONDNESS\nBefore the English term being “nuts” was associated with madness, it meant being very fond of something. As president, Barack Obama was very fond of almonds: he used to unwind with a few in the evening. The White House chef stated that Obama ate precisely seven per night. It was taken as a sign of his perfect self‑discipline, until the president later clarified it was a joke.\nFor those who are not Obama, it is possible to overlook nuts day to day. They are versatile but also superfluous, easily edged aside by crisps. At Christmas, however, nuts are unmissable. They sit there, waiting to be cracked like criminals before interrogation.\nA good nut bowl has walnuts, almonds, hazelnuts, pecans and Brazils (most of which now come from Bolivia). The one nut you won’t find in a nut bowl is the macadamia, which is too hard for conventional nut-crackers.\nThe joy of nuts has come with caveats. When I was younger, nut roast was a dreaded Christmas meal for vegetarians – assumed to be dry and disintegrating. Peanut bowls were being phased out of pubs on the basis that they contained on average a dozen traces of different people’s urine. (I have been unable to find such a study.) Then there was the growth of allergies: One in 50 children in the UK has a peanut allergy and only one in five of them outgrows it.\nIt always seemed curious to me that people could be highly allergic to one nut and completely tolerant of another. The explanation is that nuts are not very alike.\nLEGUMES OR SEEDS?\nBotanically, most nuts are not nuts. Peanuts – the world’s favourite nuts, according to the International Nut and Dried Fruit Council, are legumes. In the south of the US, they boil them like beans.\nAlmonds – the world’s favourite tree nuts, according to the same report – are seeds. Walnuts and pine nuts are also seeds, while coconuts are drupes, a type of fruit. A bag of mixed nuts is therefore like a top Premier League team – its far-flung components thrown together in a way that somehow works.\nThe best nut I have tasted was a hickory smoke-seasoned almond, sold by snacks company Cambrook. Its flavour was not dissimilar to the best bacon. The raw nuts themselves, as long as they’re of decent quality, are “not that distinguishable”, said Angus Cameron, Cambrook’s co-founder. What matters is the processing: While most roasted and salted nuts are fried on a belt that moves through oil, Cambrook bakes its nuts instead. The seasoning comes from condensed hickory smoke.\nA few decades ago, snacking nuts were mostly just salted. Now they mirror culinary trends. “We’ve had quite a lot of success with truffle-flavoured nuts,” said Cameron.\nBut nuts are not just snacks. They are pressed into oils or folded into main meals, salads and sauces: in pesto, on pizzas, whizzed into gazpacho.\nSTEP ASIDE, ANIMAL FATS\nPart of their attraction, especially in an age of rising vegetarianism and veganism, is their ability to replace animal fats. John Harvey Kellogg, the American surgeon who invented Corn Flakes and advocated vegetarianism, popularised peanut butter in the 19th century as a substitute for cow’s butter.\nToday Alexis Gauthier, chef patron at London’s Gauthier Soho restaurant, uses walnuts in his vegan version of foie gras. “The walnut has this texture that doesn’t disappear. It’s almost juicy with fats,” he said. “We break it but we don’t blitz it. We retain a bit of structure.”\nElsewhere, walnuts appear in desserts and salads. French restaurants often combine hazelnuts and chocolate. They deploy chestnuts in sugar syrup – the sickly, irresistible marrons glace. With chestnuts, it’s not the texture that matters, but “the richness”, said Gauthier.\nNowhere takes nuts as seriously as California. Almond trees are often grafted on to peach rootstocks and pollinated by billions of bees, which have to be shipped in from elsewhere in the country.\nWhen harvest comes, mechanical shakers grab the trees and toss the almonds on to the ground. By law the nuts then have to be pasteurised in case of contamination from bacteria from the ground. (Many US walnuts are also pasteurised.)\nThese industrial techniques have made California the source of 80 per cent of the world’s almonds. Almond milk is by far the most popular substitute for cow’s milk in the US, with annual sales exceeding US$1bn (S$1.3bn)\nAlthough almond consumption doubled in the UK between 2013 and 2017, we still eat less than half as many per capita as Americans.\nBut the pasteurised taste is not to everyone’s liking. “You might as well be eating cotton wool,” said Alexander Hunt, who grows nuts at Potash Farm, in Kent. Moreover, a single California almond requires 12 litres of water, which is not entirely advisable in a state afflicted by regular droughts. The pollination process also kills billions of bees.\nTIME TO GET CRACKING\nTo meet EAT-Lancet’s recommendations for nut consumption, production would have to multiply over the next few decades. Somehow this has to happen without the water stress that California’s producers currently inflict. It also requires farmers to take a leap of faith – investing in trees that won’t mature for several years.\nIn Europe, most almond orchards are not reliant on truckloads of bees or irrigation. Ken Albala suggested the lack of irrigation leaves them tasting slightly richer and oilier: “A lot of the almonds that we sell in California taste watery to me.”\nEuropean walnuts can be harvested in June and July – giving green walnuts, which are pickled or served in jams. The main harvest comes in October. The husks are separated from the shells by machines, then cracked open. They will go mouldy within a few weeks unless they are lightly roasted, which brings their moisture content down from 30 per cent to 7 to 8 per cent.\nIt would be rather delightful if we could grow more nuts in Britain. Nut-growing at the moment is small-scale to the point of artisanal. A few hundred acres of cobnuts, from the hazelnut family, and a few hundred acres of walnuts are nowhere near enough to meet local demand.\nWalnut trees grow on pretty much any well-drained soil in Britain, but squirrels, rabbits, deer and crows often get to the nuts before farmers can. Hunt, who sells walnut trees as well as nuts, says that his customers tend to be “people in their forties who are leaving the city”.\nCharles Tebbutt is hoping that more nut production will catch on as a form of sustainable agriculture, with rows of trees planted between crops such as oilseed, barley and wheat, as they are in France and elsewhere. The trees can bring up nutrients from the subsoil, which then fall to the ground in the form of leaves and nourish the soil for the following year’s cereal crops.\n“All the evidence suggests it’s viable,” said Tebbutt. “A big part of the work is to professionalise it. It’s about applying the knowledge that’s already out there.” Crack on.\nBy Henry Mance © 2020 The Financial Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     food ']}"

      How this entrepreneur’s keto meal service became a hit during the pandemic
  </h1>, 'text': 'In March this year, shortly before the miasma of a partial lockdown settled over Singapore\'s F&B scene, Constant Tong officially launched his keto meal subscription service. The timing of this endeavour, amid an unfolding pandemic, appears to have been propitious.\xa0\nWhile established businesses foundered under COVID-19\'s tectonic effects, Ketomei\xa0flourished. According to the company, it raked in\xa0more than S$1 million in revenue from 1,600 subscribers in less than a year.\nBut Ketomei\'s breakout profit – which doubled in April and May – can\'t be solely ascribed to the convenience its meal delivery service brought, during a period where dining out was verboten.\nIn fact, Ketomei\'s sales figures continued to climb even after the ""circuit breaker."" Tong surmises that this is partly due to a burgeoning local community committed to the high-fat, low-carb keto (short for ketogenic) diet.\nTouted as a quick and effective weight loss method, carbohydrate deprivation engenders a process called ketosis, where the body breaks down fat. Tong himself is a votary of the keto lifestyle, having dabbled in it to shed belly fat while shuttling between the US and Singapore for work.\nBut sticking to a low-carbohydrate diet in his home country, where consuming starchy staples is de rigueur at hawker centres, proved to be a Sisyphean task.\n“I would make three rounds of the food court, where I was repeatedly asked if I wanted rice or noodles. What\'s the point in forgoing both?” recounted the spry 53-year-old, who claims that being a keto adherent helped him to lose weight and feel energised.\n\n\nA NUMBERS GAME\nA dearth of dining options to satiate Singapore\'s growing appetite for the keto lifestyle was revealed through rudimentary market research. “I performed a Google keyword analysis of the word keto, and discovered that it had a high search volume and low competition,” shared Tong.\nParsing data is not new to the 53-year-old veteran of the tech sector, who has made the rounds as an employee of gaming industry heavyweights such as Electronic Arts in the US and Razer Inc.\nHe\'s both worked for and started a slew of venture-backed companies in the fintech space – including a China-based platform dispensing trading tips. Shortly after a brief stint leading Razer Inc\'s mobile wallet app project, he reverted to the appellation of CEO.\nThe seasoned entrepreneur shelved his initial plans to launch Ketomei in China – his company\'s name is a portmanteau combining “keto” and the Mandarin term for beauty, “mei” –\xa0 as he did not feel confident of capturing the market with limited capital.\n“China is pretty open to overseas brands, so I felt it would be better to establish ourselves in Singapore before moving into the market,” he explained. So, with about S$100,000 in savings, he founded the company locally, piloting its services to a clutch of subscribers in January.\nKetomei\'s business model is fairly lean. Customers select a one-, three- or six-week plan that comprises two daily meals from Monday to Saturday. The keto-tailored fare – which features microwavable options such as five-spice beef with konjac noodles and Japanese-style chashu pork collar with cauliflower rice – is prepared in cloud kitchens, blast chilled and tagged with nutritional information. These are delivered on a weekly basis, via riders the company directly engages to circumvent high courier fees.\n\n\nA post shared by Ketomei | Keto meal delivery (@keto.mei)\nTong revealed that their direct-to-consumer service closely references American meal delivery start-up Freshly, which was recently acquired by Nestle USA for a whopping US$1.5 billion (S$2 billion).\nNot unlike the analytics-led startup, technology has worked in Ketomei\'s favour, from allowing them to create an engaging online user experience, to orchestrating deliveries efficiently. The entrepreneur also plans to develop a breathalyser-style device that detects a state of ketosis.\n“We can make this available globally, with sales data giving us insights on which country to launch our service in,” he explained.\nAlso a boon is Ketomei\'s incisive digital marketing strategy that targets its largely female, millennial clientele through collaborations with a well-preened stable of Instagram influencers, as well as American-Singaporean keto cookbook author Kelly Tan Peterson.\nAs Ketomei\'s nutritional advisor who holds the rapt gaze of a sizeable social media following and hosts webinars elucidating the keto lifestyle, Tan Peterson brings clout to the nascent brand. This month (December 2020), it further established its presence under the brassy marquee of Mr World Singapore 2020. Tong expects this to be quite the event enlivened by “many screaming ladies drawn to the swimsuit segment.”\n\n\nBE YOUR BRAND\nA bold identity is key, if Tong\'s five months in cult-favourite Razer Inc have taught him anything. “Razer\'s branding is very strong, and they have cultivated a passionate fanbase, which is powerful,” he shared. Working closely with Razer Inc CEO Tan Min-Liang – who is purportedly an inveterate gamer – he added, underscored the importance of authenticity.\nThough hardly a long-serving employee, Tong contends that his quick departure from the firm isn\'t linked to scurrilous rumours about its toxic working culture, allegedly perpetuated by a bellicose CEO.\nRather, he says he left to pursue other opportunities. “I enjoyed working with Min, an inspiring guy who was professional every time we met. You have to be on your toes though; he\'ll let you know if you\'ve said something stupid,” he offered.\nTong appears to be the antithesis of a brash superior, with his mild-mannered countenance and slightly faltering speech. The doting father-of-one admits that his close relationship with his teenaged daughter, with whom he shares a Spotify playlist and attended a Billie Eilish concert (“I was the oldest guy in the room”), helps him relate to younger employees. He also enjoys watching anime and sussing out free mindfulness apps that are to his dismay, spiked with zombie sounds. He hasn\'t broached the keto lifestyle with his wife though, for fear of reprisal.\nDad humour aside, Tong has lofty aspirations for Ketomei. He says that his former roles in large corporations such as Singapore Airlines have helped him appreciate what it takes to scale a business. A Ketomei in China is still on the cards.\n“You can literally open a kitchen in Shanghai, which has a population of about 20 million, and being logistically advanced, can route deliveries to Zhejiang and Jiangsu. The GDP of these three provinces is higher than that of India’s,” he shared. He further lent that he plans to raise funds for Ketomei\'s overseas expansion, starting in Southeast Asia.\nFor now, the keto advocate is on track to expand his brand in Singapore. Having outgrown cloud kitchens – whose high rental fees whittle away at profit margins – the company is moving into a larger central kitchen in the West. He\'s also set to release a new gourmet menu with items such as slow-cooked short ribs and duck confit, and is planning a catchy K42 challenge to track customers\' weight loss goals over a period of six weeks.\xa0\xa0\n“Moving forward, we will focus more on educating people on the keto lifestyle, so they can make informed decisions,” he concluded.\n""Moving forward, we will focus more on educating people on the keto lifestyle, so they can make informed decisions.""\xa0– Constant Tong\n', 'related_topics': ['     food ', '     delivery ', '     Singapore ', '     Restaurants ', '     Profiles ']}"

      Ringing in the New Year at home? Gather the best food and drinks and make merry
  </h1>, 'text': 'Phase 3 notwithstanding, this will be a New Year unlike any other. Everyone’s in town, all the best joints have been booked full, and parties are limited to groups of eight. But home, as the old trope goes, is where the best parties are this year since the 10.30pm alcohol curfew doesn’t apply in the privacy of our abodes.\nIn that spirit, we’ve gathered the best options for bottled cocktails, great food and drinks, so we can usher in the New Year safe and sound with our nearest and dearest. Here’s to a better year ahead!\n\n\nOLD AND RARE SPIRITS FROM ACADEMY OF DRINKS\nNo need to stop at 10.30pm if you’re drinking at home, so why not ring in the new year with a flight of whiskies from the famed Glenrothes Distillery dating from 1968, 1969 and 1970 (there are only 300 bottles of each available across the world).\nThis aptly named Last Drop Trilogy goes for a cool S$27,645. Academy of Drinks has also procured a Grand Champagne from 1925 (S$6,990), and a Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey produced by the feted Buffalo Trace in 1980 (only 240 bottles available around the world).\nSuffice it to say, quantities are limited in Singapore, so order early.\nCOLD CUTS AND PANETTONE FROM TABLESCAPE\nThis takeaway dinner, complete with cold cuts and dessert, is a great way to graze through the evening with (several) drinks in hand. Nibble on the likes of Italian Parma ham, Spanish chorizo and pickles, before noshing on creamy pesto-draped burrata.\nWhen you’re ready for the heartier stuff, tuck into the delicious tangle of tagliatelle tossed in a rich ragu. Depending on the number of guests in your party, the festive meal (prices start from S$115.20) could come with an oven-baked, line-caught fish, braised lamb shank or roasted barbecue chicken. Enjoy the panettone, riddled with raisins, lemon zest and candied orange, for dessert or at brunch the morning after.\nDINNER WITH GIN AND TONICS FROM THE WHITE RABBIT\nThe White Rabbit’s Festive Indulgence Set (S$148 for two people) is just that: A decadent meal comprising truffle and brie brioche, beet-cured salmon, classic lobster bisque, Iberico pork collar ham, and a dark chocolate caramel tart to finish.\nFor larger groups, order the Festive Gourmet Set (S$188, feeds four), which comes with tin of 8 Gems caviar, beet-cured salmon, lobster bisque, roasted black truffle chicken and a black forest log cake.\nTo wash that all down, there’s a Botanist Gin & Tonic set (S$240) that comprises two 700ml bottles of gin and 16 bottles of East Imperial tonic. The online store also boasts a whole bunch of a la carte dishes, wines (we like the Chateau de Bernes Espirit Mediterranee, S$50) and champagne.\nNow you’re all set for a proper adult dinner party.\nDOUBLE-STUFFED DEBONED ROAST TURKEY AND APEROL SPRITZES FROM DA PAOLO GASTRONOMIA\nIf you’ve been waiting for Phase 3 to kick in before sharing a turkey with more than five people, then here’s your chance to get a load of the excellent double-stuffed roast turkey from Da Paolo (S$268).\nFilled with both an Italian pork sausage-and-truffle stuffing and a chestnut-and-mushroom stuffing, this easy-to-slice number was the moistest bird from all the turkey offerings we sampled this year.\nAlternatively, go for the less extravagant but no less succulent deboned roast chicken (S$88) with cranberry sauce and a stuffing of sweet potatoes, chicken sausage and herbs.\nAlso check out the Aperol Spritz Cocktail Kit (S$79), which comes with a bottle each of Aperol, prosecco, soda water and garnishes that will yield a dozen glasses.\nBOTTLED COCKTAILS FROM PONY\nOne of the best things to emerge from the pandemic is the rise of bottled cocktails. Where cocktails at home once meant busting out the shaker and slicing too many lemons, today’s options are decidedly more convenient.\nIn fact, it’s as easy as opening a bottle and decanting its contents into gorgeous glasses. To wit: Jigger & Pony Group’s bottled cocktails sold under the newly minted Pony label.\nAvailable in 200ml or 500ml bottles, expect premium spirits like Roku Gin, Maker’s Mark Bourbon Whiskey, and Suntory Chita Whiskey mixed into offerings such as the Negroni (S$32/S$74) and Sakura Martini (S$34/S$78).\nA TRADITIONAL CUBAN MEAL AND WINE\nIt’s not often you’ll get a traditional Cuban meal in the comforts of home, which makes Cuba Libre’s festive takeaway menu a great opportunity to try one.\nSample the cerdo asado (S$100), a slow-cooked pork shoulder, which comes with your choice of two sides that include offerings like Cuban black beans and rice, marinated cassava, fried plantains or roasted spring vegetables.

      Toko es krim jadul legendaris di Jakarta yang bertahan selama 88 tahun
  </h1>, 'text': 'JAKARTA: Mengunjungi kedai es krim Italia Ragusa di Jakarta Pusat bagaikan melompat ke mesin waktu dan kembali ke masa lalu.\nFoto-foto hitam putih dari kedai es krim tersebut di tahun 1930-an dan 1940-an menghiasi dinding toko.\nPara pelanggan menikmati es krim mereka sembari duduk di kursi rotan tua dan meski cuaca Jakarta panas dan lembab,\xa0kipas angin yang berkarat membuat\xa0mereka tetap merasa sejuk.\nDi salah satu dinding toko terdapat foto\xa0para pendiri kedai es krim, kakak beradik\xa0Luigi, Vincenzo, Pascuale, dan Francisco Ragusa, yang merupakan warga negara Italia.\nMereka mendirikan toko es krim tersebut pada tahun 1932.\n“Mereka penjahit di Jakarta dan kenalan mertua saya,” kata Sias Mawarni, yang kemudian mewarisi kedai es krim Ragusa, kepada CNA.\nIa menceritakan bagaimana Luigi dan Vincenzo Ragusa mengunjungi kota Bandung kala\xa0itu dan bertemu dengan seorang wanita Belanda yang memiliki peternakan sapi.\nMereka berpikir untuk membuat es krim dengan susu sapi tersebut, sehingga mendirikan toko es krim Ragusa di Bandung dan Jakarta pada tahun 1932.\nPara warga negara asing sangat menyukai es krim Italia tersebut, tetapi ketika Indonesia merdeka pada tahun 1945, banyak yang\xa0meninggalkan Indonesia.\nHal itu berdampak pada bisnis toko es krim Ragusa.\nPada tahun 1972, Ragusa bersaudara memutuskan untuk kembali ke Italia selamanya dan oleh karenanya ingin menutup bisnis mereka.\nSaat itu, suami Sias, Buntoro Kurniawan, bekerja di kedai Ragusa Jakarta dan mereka berhubungan keluarga karena saudara perempuan Buntoro adalah istri\xa0si bungsu dari Ragusa bersaudara.\nKeluarga Ragusa kemudian memutuskan untuk memberikan toko mereka kepada Buntoro dan Sias.\n“Mereka memberikannya kepada kami. Kami tidak perlu membayar sama sekali,” kata Sias.\nMELEWATI BANYAK RINTANGAN\nDi tangan Buntoro, 87, dan Sias, 77,\xa0 kedai es krim Italia Ragusa terus berkembang selama bertahun-tahun.\nTokoh-tokoh ternama seperti mantan presiden Indonesia Bacharuddin Jusuf Habibie dan Megawati Soekarnoputri termasuk di antara pelanggan mereka.\nPada 2012, toko es krim Italia Ragusa bahkan berhasil masuk ke Museum Rekor Dunia Indonesia sebagai toko es krim tertua di Indonesia.\nSias mengatakan bahkan aktor Hong Kong Andy Lau pernah mengunjungi kedai es krim itu.\n“Kipas angin ini pemberian\xa0Andy Lau waktu dia makan di sini,” ungkapnya sambil menunjuk kipas angin\xa0di toko tersebut.\nSebenarnya, apa yang membuat es krim Ragusa begitu istimewa?\nResep asli yang terdiri dari susu, air, gula dan tanpa bahan pengawet adalah rahasia dari es krim Ragusa yang halus dan lembut, kata Sias.\nEs krim Ragusa juga tidak menggunakan mentega dan konsisten mengandalkan rasa asli mereka yakni vanila, cokelat, stroberi, moka, dan nougat. Mereka tidak membuat gelato, hanya es krim.\nToko es krim Italia Ragusa juga menyediakan es krim tutti frutti dan ""cassata siciliana"" selama hampir 90 tahun.\nTutti frutti terdiri dari es krim vanila, cokelat, dan stroberi dengan manisan buah yang dicincang, sedangkan cassata siciliana adalah kue es krim tradisional Sisilia.\nSetelah Sias mengunjungi Italia pada tahun 1990-an, mereka memutuskan untuk menambahkan ""spaghettieis"", hidangan es krim yang terlihat seperti spaghetti, dan variasi banana split ke menu mereka.\nSpaghettieis adalah menu favorit para pelanggan.\nBisnis es krim berjalan sangat baik sehingga pada suatu waktu sempat\xa0ada sekitar 30 kedai es krim Italia Ragusa yang tersebar di seluruh Jakarta, Bekasi, Bogor, dan Bandung.\nNamun, ketika Indonesia dilanda krisis ekonomi Asia pada tahun 1998 yang berujung pada kerusuhan dan gejolak politik, beberapa gerainya dibakar massa.\nKedai es krim Ragusa di Jalan Veteran 1, Jakarta Pusat tidak diserang massa karena jaraknya sekitar 1,5km dari Istana Merdeka, sehingga kawasan tersebut dijaga oleh aparat keamanan.\n“Suamiku bilang, kenapa kita harus punya banyak cabang. Lebih baik fokus pada satu atau beberapa saja,” kata Sias yang saat ini sedang menempuh pendidikan S3 bidang kebudayaan Tionghoa di Universitas Indonesia.\nSekarang tersisa satu kedai es krim Italia Ragusa, yakni di Jalan Veteran 1, dan satu lagi restoran yang menjual es krim dan makanan di Duta Merlin, Jakarta.\nNamun, Sias mengungkap bahwa mereka mungkin akan segera menutup restoran yang berada di Duta Merlin karena kerugian yang dialami sejak pandemi COVID-19.\nKetika COVID-19 melanda Indonesia, toko terpaksa\xa0ditutup sementara waktu karena Jakarta memberlakukan Pembatasan Sosial Berskala Besar (PSBB).\nSetelah\xa0ibu kota secara bertahap memasuki PSBB Transisi, toko es krim Italia Ragusa mulai menerima pelanggan dengan menerapkan protokol kesehatan.\nSEDERHANA DAN PENUH NOSTALGIA\nEs krim Italia Ragusa memiliki tempat yang istimewa di hati banyak orang.\nOkie Johannes dan istrinya, yang ingin dipanggil sebagai Fanny, termasuk di antara tamu Ragusa yang menikmati es krim legendaris tersebut ketika CNA berkunjung pada pertengahan November.\nPasangan yang sama-sama berusia 57 tahun tersebut telah mengunjungi tempat itu sejak mereka masih muda lantaran mereka tinggal dekat toko Ragusa.\nSaat mereka mulai berkencan, mereka sesekali mengunjungi toko es krim Ragusa dan bahkan setelah mereka menikah dan pindah ke daerah lain, mereka masih menikmati es krim tersebut jika waktu memungkinkan.\n“Saya suka. Rasanya tetap sama dari dulu sampai sekarang karena buatan sendiri,” kata Johannes.\n“Dulu, merek es krim juga belum banyak,” kata Fanny seraya menambahkan bahwa tutti fruti adalah es krim favoritnya.\nPasangan itu juga mengatakan bahwa harganya tetap terjangkau selama bertahun-tahun.\nSatu sendok es krim dihargai Rp15.000, sementara hidangan es krim seperti es krim spaghetti dan banana split dijual dengan harga Rp35.000.\nAde Rukmini dan keluarganya juga sudah lama menjadi pelanggan.\n“Rasanya khas,” katanya.\nMeski nuansa toko terasa tidak modern, generasi muda juga ada yang gemar makan di toko es krim Ragusa.\nIndah, 20, dan Lily, 19, menjelaskan mereka pertama kali mengetahui tempat itu dari\xa0seorang teman.\nMereka sama-sama merasa es krim Italia Ragusa lebih enak dari merek es krim yang sudah mendunia.\n“Suasananya di sini juga nyaman,” kata Indah.\nArtikel ini diterjemahkan dari\xa0Bahasa Inggris.\nBaca juga\xa0artikel Bahasa Indonesia\xa0yang satu ini.\nIkuti akun CNA di\xa0Facebook\xa0dan\xa0Twitter\xa0untuk membaca artikel-artikel terkini.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Indonesia ', '     Jakarta ', '     food ', '     business ']}"

      Jakarta's 88-year-old ice cream parlour that stands the test of time
  </h1>, 'text': ""JAKARTA: Stepping into Ragusa Italian ice cream parlour in Central Jakarta is like hopping into a time machine and travelling back in time.\nOld sepia photos of the ice cream parlour in the 1930s and 1940s adorn its walls as patrons sit on rattan chairs to enjoy their ice cream, the rusty ceiling fans keeping\xa0them cool in Jakarta’s hot and humid weather.\nOn one of\xa0its walls is\xa0an old picture of the ice cream parlour’s founders, Italian brothers Luigi, Vincenzo, Pascuale and Francisco Ragusa, who started the ice cream place in 1932.\n“They were tailors in Jakarta and acquaintances of my parents-in-law,” said Mdm Sias Mawarni, the current owner of the business.\nShe recounted how\xa0Luigi and Vincenzo Ragusa had visited Bandung city back then and met a Dutch lady who owned a cow farm.\nThe brothers thought of making\xa0ice cream with\xa0cow's\xa0milk, so\xa0they established Ragusa ice cream parlour in Bandung and Jakarta in 1932.\nForeigners were especially fond of the Italian ice cream but when Indonesia gained independence in 1945, many of them left the country and Ragusa ice cream started to feel the impact.\n\n\nIn 1972, the Ragusa brothers decided to return to Italy for good and wanted to close the business.\nBy that time, Mdm Mawarni’s husband Buntoro Kurniawan was working at the Jakarta parlour and they became family as Mr Kurniawan’s sister had married the youngest Ragusa brother.\nThe Ragusa family then decided to give the business to Mr Kurniawan and Mdm Mawarni.\n“They just gave it to us. We didn’t have to pay at all,” Mdm Mawarni told CNA.\nWITHSTANDING THE TEST OF TIME\nIn the hands of Mr Kurniawan, 87, and Mdm Mawarni, 77, Ragusa Italian continued to flourish over the years.\xa0\nFamous figures like former Indonesian presidents Bacharuddin Jusuf Habibie and Megawati\xa0Soekarnoputri were among its customers.\xa0\nIn 2012, Ragusa Italian even made it into Indonesia's World Records Museum as the country's oldest ice cream parlour.\nMdm Mawarni said and even Hong Kong actor Andy Lau had once paid the ice cream parlour a visit.\n“The ceiling fans were gifted by Andy Lau\xa0when he ate here,” she revealed while pointing at the ceilings fans.\nWhat makes its\xa0ice cream so special?\nThe original recipe which contains mostly milk, water, sugar\xa0and no\xa0preservatives is the secret of the smooth and silky ice cream, said Mdm Mawarni. \xa0\nThey do not use butter and have also consistently stuck to the original flavours of vanilla, chocolate, strawberry, mocha and nougat. They do not make gelato, only ice cream.\xa0\n\n\nRagusa Italian has been serving tutti frutti and cassata siciliana for almost 90 years.\xa0\nTutti frutti consists of vanilla, chocolate and strawberry ice cream with chopped candied fruits, while cassata siciliana is the ice cream parlour's take on traditional Sicilian cake.\nAfter Mdm Mawarni visited Italy in the 1990s, they decided to add spaghettieis, an ice cream dish that look like a plate of spaghetti,\xa0and banana split to the menu with the former now being their bestseller.\nAt one point, the business was doing so well that there were about 30 Ragusa Italian ice cream parlours scattered throughout Jakarta, satellite city Bekasi, Bogor and Bandung.\nBut when Indonesia was hit by the Asian economic crisis in 1998\xa0which led to riots and political unrest, some of their outlets were burned down by mobs.\nThe Ragusa ice cream parlour in Central Jakarta remained untouched as it is located about 1.5 km from the presidential palace, hence the area was safeguarded.\n“My husband then told me, why do we need to have so many branches. It’s better to focus on just one or a few,” said Mdm Mawarni, who is currently\xa0pursuing a doctorate on Chinese culture at University of Indonesia.\xa0\nThere is now one Ragusa Italian ice cream parlour and another that sells ice-cream and food, although Mdm Mawarni revealed that they might close the latter soon due to economic challenges brought by the pandemic.\nWhen the COVID-19 pandemic hit Indonesia, they\xa0had to be temporarily closed as Jakarta\xa0imposed a partial lockdown.\nAs the capital gradually loosened the restrictions, Ragusa Italian started to welcome guests again\xa0with safe distancing measures in place.\nNOSTALGIC AND SIMPLE\nRagusa Italian's ice cream has a special place in the hearts of many Indonesians.\nMr Okie Johannes and his wife,\xa0who wanted to be known as Mdm Fanny, were among\xa0the guests enjoying the treats during CNA's visit in November.\nBoth 57 years old, they have been visiting the place since they were young.\nWhen they started to date, they occasionally visited Ragusa ice cream and even after they got married and moved to a different area, they still indulge in the ice cream\xa0when time allows.\n“I just like it. The taste has remained the same from back in the old days until today because it’s homemade,” noted Mr Johannes.\n\n\n“Back in the days, there were not a lot of ice cream brands available,” said Mdm Fanny, adding that\xa0tutti fruti is her favourite ice cream.\nThe couple also said that the prices have remained affordable over the years with a scoop of ice cream being priced at 15,000 rupiah (US$1.06), while ice cream dishes such as spaghetti ice cream and banana split are sold\xa0at 35,000 rupiah.\nMdm Ade Rukmini and her family have also been\xa0longtime customers.\n“It has its own signature (taste),” she said.\nDespite the old school vibes, the younger generation is flocking to the ice cream parlour.\nMs Indah, 20, and Ms Lily, 19, said they first discovered the place through a friend.\nThey both felt that the taste of Ragusa Italian's ice cream is better than other\xa0established global ice cream brands.\n“The atmosphere here is also lovely,” said Ms Indah.\xa0\nRead this story in Bahasa Indonesia\xa0here.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Indonesia ', '     Jakarta ', '     food ', '     business ']}"

      Can a millennial hawker rejuvenate her great-grandfather’s zi char stall?
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: When aspiring hawker Debbie Yam started working at her family's zi char stall, she was forbidden from cooking for customers after she burnt even simple dishes, like fried rice and hor fun.\nTang Kay Kee Fish Head Bee Hoon was a household name serving traditional Cantonese-style fare, and Yam was a business graduate who ended up being relegated to basic kitchen work, such as cutting up vegetables and seasoning the food.\n“For hor fun or fried rice, you need to have wok hei (wok ‘breath’ in Cantonese). Mine was just black,” she recalled.\n“In the beginning, when I was learning how to cook, I burnt a lot of my hair, my eyebrows and a lot of food. My friends who came to support me had to eat my burnt food.”\nOnly after months of training did the matriarch of the family business, great-aunt Tang Yock Cheng, allow her to serve customers a dish of fish head bee hoon that she cooked herself.\nIt was the same for her undergraduate cousin, Kamen Tang, who worked there at weekends and over the school holidays.\n“She made us first cook for ourselves to eat and then for her to eat, and then for our friends,” said Yam. “So by the time we could serve customers, it’s been fine-tuned to perfection, according to her.”\nThe 30-year-old is among a small number of young hawkers answering the call to carry on the trade. And she has a few ideas about how to take her family’s legacy to the next level.\nBut even as a new generation has hopes of transforming the business to appeal to new customers, the current generation has certain reservations due to old practices, the programme Belly Of A Nation finds out.\nWATCH: Singapore hawkers and those keeping the trade alive (47:32)\nSTALL WAS NEARLY SOLD\nTang Kay Kee Fish Head Bee Hoon was started in 1946 by Yam’s great-grandfather Tang Pak Kay, a pushcart vendor who peddled his food along Upper Hokkien Street in Chinatown. And he had a little peculiarity — he went around barefoot.\n“At that time, a pair of wooden clogs cost 70 cents … But he wasn’t willing to buy them,” great-aunt Tang said in Cantonese. “He was stingy. He wanted to save money because he had a family.”\nAfter he died from old age in the 1970s, she took over his stall, which was then moved to Hong Lim Market and Food Centre in 1978 when the authorities resettled street hawkers in purpose-built hawker centres across the island.\n“She took over because she was the only one in the family who wasn’t married,” said Yam. “She was the one with the most time and had no commitments.”\nGreat-aunt Tang was afraid, however, that the business would suffer after the resettlement.\nPreviously when she was selling food from the pushcart, many customers who drove used to wait along the road to pick up their orders.\n“She was worried that no one would park their car and buy from her at the hawker centre,” said Yam.\nUnsure about how business would pan out, she did not even buy a fridge for the stall, opting instead to carry foodstuffs from her nearby flat to the stall every day.\nBut business improved, so she bought one a few months later.\nYam remembered hanging out at the stall at weekends as a child, helping to wash the dishes. “We’re a very tight-knit family. Our relatives used to help her at the stall — including my parents,” she said.\nIn 2016, however, her great-aunt wanted to sell the stall owing to a manpower shortage. Yam, who was in New Zealand in a holiday job, got wind of it and told her to hold off the sale until she returned.\n“Her whole life was dedicated to this stall. If there’s no hawker life, her life would be quite meaningless,” she said.\nIn addition, Yam — who has a management degree from the Singapore Institute of Management Global Education in association with the University of Manchester — did not mind being a hawker.\n“I want to learn things. I think it’s a very interesting trade, and I see an opportunity to … gain (some) experience,” she said.\nRESISTING CHANGE\nYam’s parents, who are in the construction business, supported her decision but warned her of the long hours and physical demands ahead.\nBut what she did not expect when she started working there in 2017 was that her great-aunt, who is now 75, and the older workers at the stall would be so resistant to change.\nFor example, she wanted to introduce plastic takeaway containers, but Tang refused and said it was an additional cost for customers.\n“(The older folks) have been doing things their way for so long. They don’t want to change anything, even small things like that,” said Yam.\nThey want to keep using paper boxes. But it’s a waste of time folding (these), and we have a manpower crunch.\nWhen she proposed a lunch service, Tang had her doubts. The stall had never opened that early, as the crowd from the Central Business District seemed strapped for time.\n“In the daytime, no one ate zi char because my father took a long time to cook fish head bee hoon,” said Tang.\n“For one bowl, he’d take at least 20 minutes.\xa0 He wanted to cook it till the soup was beautiful.”\nYam managed to convince her great-aunt, however, to let her sell two dishes — fried rice and hor fun — starting in 2018.\n“There’d be no loss opening the stall during lunchtime,” she reasoned. “Rental is a fixed cost, and there’s no added labour cost, as I was the one cooking.”\nAt first, the stall struggled to draw the crowd. But in true millennial style, she turned to social media to market the lunch menu.\n“We put up posters and Instagram-worthy photos. That helped to capture people’s attention,” said Yam, who had experience doing social media marketing while working at a cafe previously.\nWhen business picked up, she wanted to revamp the lunch menu with a zi char concept inspired by poke bowls.\nAgain her great-aunt was sceptical, commenting that those dishes — such as spicy braised pork belly rice and hor fun with sous vide egg — were “nothing special” and would not sell.\n“When I tried to introduce different bowls, (the older workers) resisted it and wanted only the traditional flavours,” said Yam. “I’m from the younger generation; I’d know what’s popular with the younger crowd.”\nSure enough, these lunch bowls became a hit, filling a lunch vacuum the business had for decades. However, Tang did not let her introduce the concept for dinner.\n“She said that it isn’t going to sell. She still prefers to sell family-style zi char dishes at night,” said Yam.\nAnother of her suggestions was a point-of-sale (POS) system to make the ordering process more efficient. “(When) one order comes in, they have to shout (the order) at least three or four times to each other,” she said.\nThey’re a bit old, their hearing may not be the best, so it gets confusing.\nTang, however, said no. She was afraid that someone would steal the POS terminal and make off with the takings.\nFEELING BURNT OUT\nTwo years ago, Yam — who was living with her parents in Choa Chu Kang — moved into Tang’s flat in Chinatown to spend more time with her great-aunt and do away with commuting.\n“The (working) hours are excruciating. It’s hard for a young-generation hawker. I see my friends going out for dinners and parties, and I can’t join them … I’m leading a different lifestyle,” she added. “And I really miss smelling nice.”\nHer toughest period as a hawker was when COVID-19 hit, especially during the “circuit breaker”. She introduced a delivery service to address the drop in customers, and the first week was the hardest on her.\nApart from cooking, she had to manage the delivery orders, the routes and the drivers. “I slept less than two hours every single day because there was a lot of co-ordinating,” she recounted.\n“I was very, very burnt out. I remember I broke down at the end of that week. I was like, ‘Oh no, this is only the first week.’ And then at that point, the circuit breaker was two months.”\nHer 23-year-old cousin then pitched in to help co-ordinate the deliveries, for example, as she realised she “couldn’t do everything”.\nWhile the pandemic has forced hawkers like her to adapt quickly, the biggest driving force behind the stall, her great-aunt, is not about to change the old ways.\n“She’s still going on strong in (terms of) making decisions,” said Yam. “This is her stall — she’s still in charge. If she wants to do it her way, I’ll support her because I’m here (in) a support role.”\nWatch the programme Belly Of A Nation here.

      The hottest turkeys in town this season? They’re full of Asian spices

      Commentary: Lab-grown meat approved for the first time in Singapore – but will people bite?
  </h1>, 'text': 'BATH, England: Cultured meat made from animal cells without animal slaughter has been approved for sale for the first time.\nThe approval, granted by the Singapore Food Agency to US food company Eat Just for their cultured “chicken bites”, is a watershed moment for the future of meat.\nUnlike existing products, which imitate meat with plant-based ingredients, cultured meat will provide us with a new way to make the real thing.\nAs well as avoiding animal slaughter, cultured meat could be key to addressing public health concerns linked to meat from animals and has just a fraction of the environmental impact of conventional meat.\nAlthough not quite as green as eating plants only, cultured meat may be a way to satiate our global appetite for animal meat without all the problems animal farming entails.\nLONG HISTORY OF DEVELOPMENT\nThe technology has been in development for many years, with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) first experimenting with cultured meat in 2001.\nOver a decade later, in 2013, tasters tried the world’s first cultured meat hamburger at a press event in London.\nAt that time the quality was rudimentary – tasters said that despite a distinctly meaty taste, the product lacked texture and especially fat, problems which the industry has since been working to address.\nMore importantly perhaps, prohibitively high costs meant that commercialisation seemed a long way away – at the time, it was reported that the burger cost US$280,000.\nSince then, scientists have made great strides to make cultured meat a reality. Millions of dollars in investment have poured into the dozens of cultured meat startups across Asia, Europe, and America.\nScientists have overcome many technical barriers, from developing cell lines to refining bioreactors to identifying a sustainable medium for the meat to grow in.\nFollowing the news of approval in Singapore, it is not unlikely that other countries will follow suit: Regulatory discussions are already well underway in Europe and the US.\nOnce cultured meat is approved for market, the next big question concerns consumers – who will want to eat cultured meat, and how can more people be persuaded to embrace the future of food?\nThese questions have been the topic of my PhD research, and the data leaves me cautiously optimistic about consumer adoption of cultured meat.\nACCEPTANCE OF LAB-GROWN MEAT\nAlthough most people eat meat, many are less than comfortable with the way animals are used in factory farming and most view veganism as more ethical and better for the environment.\nThis baseline level of ambivalence about eating animals may account for quite high levels of interest in cultured meat: Surveys indicate that more than half of European consumers want to try cultured meat, and around two-thirds of Americans.\nIn Asia, where cultured meat will first be sold, public acceptance is even higher.\nNot everybody is on board with the concept: Research has found that some consumers are concerned about food safety, and may view cultured meat as unnatural.\nMany of these fears appear to be associated with food neophobia (a fear of new foods). Such concerns appear to be more common in older, less educated and more conservative consumers.\nThat said, religious scholars have indicated that cultured meat could be endorsed as both kosher and halal, indicating potential appeal to religious groups.\nEven those who are open to trying cultured meat are unlikely to adopt it in the long term unless it is affordable and it passes the all-important taste test. Eat Just has said that although their first-of-their-kind cultured chicken is currently an expensive high-end product, it is likely in the longer term that cultured meat will be cheaper than meat from animals.\nConsumers in Singapore will decide whether the chicken bites pass the taste test, but Eat Just’s demonstrations have left journalists impressed.\nAll of these things are likely to improve with time. Not only will cultured meat products get better and cheaper as the technology advances, but consumers will probably view it as more acceptable the more familiar they get with it.\nApproval by the Singapore Food Agency is likely to be seen by consumers as a major signal of safety and quality, further bolstering acceptance.\nTASTE AND PRICE ARE KEY\nAlso, the data suggests that cultured meat can appeal to consumers, which plant-based alternatives fail to satisfy.\nThose who consume plant-based meat alternatives are more likely to be women and probably already have meat-reducing tendencies.\nConversely, cultured meat tends to appeal more to men – especially to the heaviest meat eaters.\nWhile some may see cultured meat as unnatural, the biggest meat-lovers are generally the most excited to try it. The technology, therefore, has the potential to substantially reduce demand for conventional meat, possibly far more than plant-based meat.\nIn the long term, getting the price and taste right are paramount for consumer adoption of cultured meat.\nThere is some level of food neophobia, and not everybody will be an early adopter, but acceptance of cultured meat will probably increase over time as familiarity increases and products get better and cheaper.\nThe science of cultured meat has made great strides in the past decade, from proof of concept to approval for sale to the public.\nThis seal of approval is a major milestone for the technology and a major signal to the world that cultured meat is not only safe, but feasible, and could play a major role in the world’s future protein landscape.\nChris Bryant is a PhD candidate at the University of Bath.\xa0This commentary first appeared on The Conversation. \n\n', 'related_topics': ['     food ']}"

      91-year-old hawker behind historic wonton noodle stall calls it quits
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: For nearly six decades, hawker Leong Yuet Meng, 91, had been getting up before the crack of dawn six days a week, to prepare her old-school wonton noodles.\nOne of Singapore’s oldest hawkers if not the oldest, this Cantonese cook is well known as the founder of the Nam Seng Noodle House that was just outside the old National Library in Stamford Road.\nBut she has closed her only stall, in Far East Square along China Street, where she had relocated 20 years ago. It is a casualty of the COVID-19 crisis, with the work-from-home norm having hollowed out the Central Business District.\n“The business dropped drastically overnight. It was very hard to get back to where we were before,” she said.\n“Ideally, I’d like to continue … I hope to preserve my brand (Nam Seng) — I built it up with a lot of hardship.”\nIn the programme Belly Of A Nation, hawkers such as Leong share their fears and dismay during the pandemic, and relate how getting by became more and more challenging.\nHANDS-ON, EVEN AT HER AGE\nIt was in 1962 when Leong opened her stall — financed by her late husband — at a little food centre in front of the old National Library.\nHer first foray into the hawker trade had been to sell chicken porridge and macaroni at a school in Queen Street, but she learnt to make wonton mee from her cousin, an amah who also sold this dish in Chinatown.\nThe stall’s name was suggested by her mother-in-law. “Nam means Nanyang (the region encompassing Malaya and the wider Southeast Asia), since we were doing business in Nanyang, and Seng represents a successful business,” said Leong.\nDuring the withdrawal of British troops from Singapore later in the 1960s, her husband, who worked as a clerk for the British, was offered a chance to move his family to the United Kingdom.\n“I said, ‘Please don’t joke with me. Go overseas? I don’t know a single English word. I’ll stay here,’” she recalled.\nBack then, they sold their signature dish for 30 cents a bowl.\n“You’d have had wonton, noodles and char siu,” she said. “I started at 30 cents and increased it to 50 cents (and then) to 70 cents; then from a dollar … until today’s S$5.”\nBefore the library was torn down, she relocated to Joo Chiat and then accepted an invitation to open a stall at Far East Square, where she also sold fried rice, venison hor fun and seafood hor fun.\nAlthough she had a small team of helpers, Leong was still very involved in running the stall, including waking up early in the morning to pick up fresh produce at a wet market in Toa Payoh, where she lives.\nHer second son, Michael Tang, would send her to Nam Seng, where she would spend the day making the wontons from scratch and taking customers’ orders.\n“I like to be hands-on … A person must be able to do everything. I don’t rely on the workers,” she said.\n“If you want to make money, don’t complain about hardship. Go back home to sleep if you worry about hardship.”\nFor two decades, she witnessed life in busy China Street, but that came to a halt when COVID-19 struck.\nAt her age, she belongs to the high-risk group, and with people also staying away from the CBD, she shut the stall temporarily. But the restless matriarch complained about being bored during the “circuit breaker” period.\n“I just stayed at home for two months,” she said. “I read the newspapers, and sometimes I watched television.”\nENTERING THE TRADE BEFORE CIRCUIT BREAKER\nFor 22-year-old Delonix Tan Wei Jie, on the other hand, he could not have chosen a more inopportune time to enter the hawker trade.\nHaving signed up for the National Environment Agency’s Incubation Stall Programme, he opened his fish ball stall, SanDai Fishball, at Amoy Street Food Centre when the number of COVID-19 cases was on the rise.\n“After four days of operation, the Government announced that on April 7, there’d be this circuit breaker,” he lamented, calling it suay (Hokkien for unlucky).\nAlthough he had little experience in cooking, he had been helping his father make yong tau foo at a wet market in Toa Payoh, and thought he would like the “hectic” hawker lifestyle.\nWhen he started off, he was doing double duty: During the day, he was at his stall, and overnight, he helped out with his family’s food business.\nGiven his schedule, his girlfriend helped him out with his stall initially.\n“She knew that I was very stressed, running tight on cash, et cetera, so she offered to help,” said the newbie, who acknowledged that his cooking skills needed “some time to develop”.\nThis was after he shuttered his stall during the circuit breaker, as it was in the CBD and he realised there would be almost “zero footfall”.\nAfter re-opening it in June, he saw that the lunchtime office crowd who used to throng the food centre had still not returned.\n“We spoke to … our customers, and they told us most of them would be coming back only next year,” he said. So, after a few months, he decided to call it quits and help his father at the wet market.\n“Instead of continuing (to) throw money into this black hole, we decided to just cut it off,” he said. “(Being) a hawker … is very, very tough work, and the (profit margins are) very, very thin.\n“After this experience, I don’t think I want to be a hawker.”\nPROMISE OF A COMEBACK\nLeong also resumed business after the circuit breaker measures were lifted. “I did so immediately, even if it was just to meet people,” she said.\nHowever, as her customers were mostly office workers in the CBD, business was quiet. In July, she closed her Far East Square outlet for good, owing to the dwindling crowd as well as leasing issues.\n“When I started renting there 20 years ago, the people (building management) were nice. Who knew that they’d change this year and become difficult to talk to?” she said.\nOne of her employees has returned to China, another went to work in her brother’s restaurant and the last one “wanted to rest”.\nWATCH: Old tastes — Singapore hawkers serving up traditional Asian recipes (46:25)\nAt her age, Leong should be retiring comfortably, but she is adamant about keeping the Nam Seng brand alive.\n“I’ve worked for so many years. My focus and dedication these last 60 years have been for my brand. How can I bear to let it go?” she said.\n“We’ll take our time, and we’ll find a new place. We’ll make a comeback. I’ll inform all of you through the newspapers, the Internet and telephone when we open once again.""\nWatch the programme Belly Of A Nation here.\n', 'related_topics': ['     COVID-19 ', '     food ', '     CNA Insider ']}"

      Commentary: Is lab-grown meat a new frontier or a passing fad?
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: This week, Singapore made global headlines by being the first country in the world to approve a lab-grown meat for general public consumption.\nEat Just, a San Francisco-based company, will soon debut its “chicken bites” here, which feature meat developed from animal cells in laboratories.\nThis comes on the heels of recent news of Singaporean company Shiok Meats being the first in the world to culture lobster meat and before that, shrimp meat, in the lab.\xa0 And another local startup, TurtleTree Labs, has won awards\xa0for its lab-grown milk.\nIs Singapore the bellwether of a new disruptive industry?\nMillions of startup investment dollars, both in Singapore and other developed economies like the US, have been poured into developing lab-grown meat (also known as cultured or cell-based meat) with its proponents showing a passion that seems to match that seen during the dot com era.\nThe alternative meat market, on the whole, was worth US$14 billion in 2019 – just one per cent of the US$1.4 trillion global meat industry. But Barclays estimates it will grow ten\xa0times its size to US$140 billion by 2029.\nALTERNATIVE PROTEINS IN SINGAPORE\nTissue culture from plant and animal cells is not in itself a new technology, and the former has been used to produce high yielding clones of economically important crops like rubber and banana.\nBut tremendous advances in molecular science, cell culture technology, bioreactor engineering and food science make it possible to assemble cells into tissues which resemble the meat from slaughtered animals.\nSingapore’s high standards for regulating food safety are well-recognised, and is probably a factor behind Eat Just’s decision to launch their product here.\nIn the food industry, it is important for authorities to employ “science-based” and “transparent” criteria and processes to regulate new or novel foods.\nLab-grown meat further aligns closely with the “Singapore Food Story”, an initiative by the Government to strengthen the country’s food security. One of its major thrusts is to encourage innovation in alternative proteins at home.\nWith limited land and water resources, Singapore’s potential to improve its food self-sufficiency is to rely on technology-enabled farming and culturing meat in bioreactors.\nBoth are akin to growing food in traditional agriculture systems, albeit using less space and capitalising on the country’s high technological capabilities.\nThese reasons have provided the impetus for Singapore to move its agriculture into controlled environments, such as vertical vegetable farms.\nWILL LAB-GROWN MEATS GAIN TRACTION?\nClimate change also adds significant pressure on food systems, which may accelerate the foray into lab-grown meat globally.\nThe livestock industry is a major source of greenhouse gases, uses much water and land, and is pollutive when animal excreta is left untreated.\nAnimals are also inefficient converters of plant material into protein.\nThe above on their own would form compelling arguments not to grow and slaughter animals for food.\xa0 And this is before the ethical and sometimes religious reasons for not killing animals are considered.\nAnother argument is that lab-cultured meat is grown in sterile containers (bioreactors), with no use of antibiotics and no fear of passing on toxic bacteria. Eat Just said safety tests found its cultured chicken to have “extremely low and significantly cleaner microbiological content”, compared to traditional chicken.\nWhile rural farming is likely to remain the main source of the world’s food, there is a movement to intensify efforts to not only make farming more sustainable but to develop alternative solutions\xa0that can feed the world.\nSTIFF COMPETITION AHEAD\nSome may shun lab-grown meat because it’s a processed food – chemical and physical techniques produce the meat structure from cells.\nBut this is not enough to be a negative factor because much of what we consume today has also undergone some form of processing to preserve their freshness.\nIts main competitor right now is plant-based protein which has shown exponential growth. Both have similarities\xa0as plant-based protein is\xa0processed using plant material as ingredients.\nPlant-based protein companies like Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat have had commercially available products for over a year and have made significant inroads into the diets of both vegetarians and omnivores.\nRestaurant brands are catching on too. On Nov 9, McDonald’s announced it will launch its plant-based meat alternatives line, “McPlant”, in 2021, after test running the “PLT” burger developed with Beyond Meat earlier this year in Canada.\nLab-grown meats will thus face stiff competition for market share.\nPRICE AND NOVELTY THE LARGEST OBSTACLES\nBut perhaps the biggest obstacle to acceptance would be the combination of price and the novel nature of lab-grown meats.\nWhile the cost of production inputs is still high, the anticipation is that this will be reduced through innovations resulting from multi-million dollar investments into lab-grown meat companies by both the public and private sector.\nEat Just, for instance, is currently raising at least US$200 million in what may be its last fundraising round, before going public at a US$2 billion valuation. Among its backers are Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-Shing and venture capital firm Khosa Ventures.\nThe bulk of Asian consumers are still price-sensitive when purchasing food, so lab-grown meat must provide compelling reasons for a switch from traditional meat, all things being equal.\xa0\nOf course, the big unknown is how choices will be influenced when shortages in the meat industry arise, such as the culling of pigs due to ongoing episodes of African swine fever worldwide, and the COVID-19 pandemic disrupting exports and imports.\nThe other pushback may be more cultural. In Asia, particularly, food culture has strong historical antecedents in legacy dishes, where whole fish or whole poultry are served.\nIt would be difficult to imagine a lab-grown whole shrimp or chicken with current technology. It would also be difficult to imagine having one’s chicken rice with only chicken steaks or fish-head curry with only fillets.\nBut of course, there are food recipes which do not require whole chicken or fish.\nHistory has demonstrated that culinary norms are changeable. The potato was a novel food brought to Europe from South America centuries ago. Its acceptance took a very winding path before its pre-eminence today in Western food culture.\nWHAT CAN MOVE THE NEEDLE\nFor lab-cultured meat to mainstream as a meat item in the diet of mass citizenry, it will be necessary for key influencers to lend their support and for there to be public information campaigns.\nConsumers may wonder why they should change, or worry about the risks. Arguments about cleanliness and safety commonly stand up well during periods of food insecurity, but are soon forgotten when the crisis is over.\nFor lab-grown meat to be sustainable, it must be economically viable, ecologically friendly and socially acceptable.\nThe economic viability as a mass market product has yet to be proven; its social acceptability is still untested, especially with respect to pricing and benefits. It is an ecologically friendly technology by some measures but by others, like energy use efficiency, remains to be seen.\xa0\nWhat lies ahead for lab-grown meat will depend much on the future of the food and production systems that it seeks to replace.\nIf solutions are not forthcoming to deal with declining land and water resources, environmentally\xa0degrading effects of some modern farming systems, and climate change, then lab-produced food will increasingly make more sense.\nFor a small island state like Singapore, producing novel food and aspiring to be an innovation hub for it makes even more sense, in terms of economics and food resilience.\nEven if novel foods like plant-based protein or lab-grown meat do not become mainstream protein, there is still enough growth potential in Asia for Singapore to create and capture sufficient value as an emergent industry.\nPaul Teng is Adjunct Senior Fellow (Food Security) in the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies, Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.\n', 'related_topics': ['     food ', '     agriculture ']}"

      Lab-grown chicken to be sold in Singapore after 'world's first' approval for cultured meat

The first, a food stall in a coffee shop in a commercial area nearby, had to close just after a week when Malaysians were ordered to stay home to stop COVID-19 from spreading in mid-March. The coffee shop eventually decided to cease operations a month later.\xa0\n“When that happened, we already confirmed this shop lot,” Edmund Cheong’s daughter Junias Cheong said. “We had to wait for the MCO (movement control order) to be over to start renovations.” \xa0 \xa0\n\n\nAnd in a short span of just three months, Lucky Seventeen has garnered repeated customers and wooed foodies who yearn for a taste of the Singaporean version of Hokkien mee.\xa0\n“We wanted a place where fellow Singaporeans could go when they miss home, and at the same time, introduce this delicious dish to our friends in Malaysia,” Edmund Cheong said.\nSEAFOOD GALORE\nThe mention of Hokkien mee in central Malaysia will naturally conjure up images of thick yellow\xa0noodles drenched in dark sauce, savoury with a hint of sweetness.\xa0\nTherefore, it takes an extra effort for Lucky Seventeen to convince curious diners of its version.\xa0\n“We have to explain, this is Singaporean, prawn-based and has gravy. And most of them like it after they try,” Alan Cheong, the 17-year-old son of Edmund Cheong, said. \xa0\nIn the kitchen, a big pot of the prawn broth - the essence of the dish - sits between the two black woks for easy reach. Lucky Seventeen’s head chef, a Malaysian who only wished to be known as Sam, shared that the flavourful broth is the result of choice ingredients and long stewing.\xa0\nShallots and prawns are fried until fragrant, and then boiled together with pork bones, old chicken and his concoction of seasoning\xa0for a couple of hours, he said.\xa0\nPriced between RM9.90 (US$2.40) and RM19.90, the fried Hokkien prawn mee here comes in several seafood choices. In addition to pork belly slices, diners can opt for prawns, squid or clams - or all of them - in their noodles. There is also the premium version with big prawns.\xa0\nThis is Lucky Seventeen’s spin on the fried Hokkien prawn mee, as how hawkers in Singapore have their own take on the quintessential dish.\xa0\n“(In Singapore) certain stalls don’t put pork belly and there are stalls that don’t put squid. They definitely don’t put lala in the noodles.\n“We want to make it very seafoody and offer more varieties for the people. People here are not familiar with this dish yet, so we want to give more variations and lala is one,” Junias Cheong said.\xa0\nAnd of course, each serving comes with a trio of must-haves - crispy pork lard, lime and sambal belacan - which when combined with the gravy, yield appetite-whetting flavours.\xa0\n\n\nUNLIKELY PAIRING OF KAMPUNG CHICKEN\xa0\nAs its logo suggests, Lucky Seventeen specialises in one main dish, which is the Hokkien fried prawn noodles.\nRather uniquely, it also offers boneless poached kampung chicken on the side.\xa0\n“Our chef\xa0has a good recipe. This is very tender, and a lot of people\xa0are impressed by the chicken,” Junias Cheong said.\xa0\nThe Cheongs are already looking at expanding, hopefully with another outlet before the end of the year. Menu expansion is also being considered.\xa0\nSome customers have also been asking for bak chor mee (noodles with minced meat), Junias Cheong said, but for now, her father hopes\xa0the eatery would establish itself as a fried Hokkien prawn mee specialty shop.\xa0\nIn the meantime, customers can find comfort in another common taste of Singapore in its drinks menu - iced sugarcane with lemon, refreshing with a welcome citrusy zing. \xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     Malaysia ', '     Singapore ', '     food ']}"

      Authorities will not ‘dictate’ farming methods as Singapore pushes for increased productivity: Grace Fu
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE:\xa0The authorities will not “dictate” farming methods even as Singapore pushes for increased productivity, said Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu on Wednesday (Nov 25).\nMs Fu was speaking during a question and answer session at her ministry’s 2020: Singapore Food Story\xa0appreciation event, which was live streamed on the Ministry of Sustainability and Environment\'s (MSE) Facebook page.\xa0“We will help, we will not dictate, we will not say that you have to use a high-tech way or other,” said Ms Fu, who was responding to a question on whether Singapore’s shift to high-tech farming would leave behind some traditional farmers and possibly leading them to close their farms.\n“But in the end, we\'ll look at what can you produce. And that to us is important because we have to deal with a land constraint and a land budget in a way. And then we have to meet our goals, given the constraint of land.”\nUnder the ""30 by 30""\xa0target, the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) has set a goal of producing 30 per cent of Singapore’s nutritional needs by 2030. This\xa0was announced in March last year.\nLast month,\xa0plans for the Lim Chu Kang area to be transformed into a high-tech agri-food cluster were announced to help\xa0strengthen the country’s food security and also create jobs for Singaporeans.\nIn a media release, SFA said that the redeveloped Lim Chu Kang agri-food cluster should be able to produce more than three times its current food production when completed.\nThe master plan, undertaken in consultation with stakeholders, is expected to be completed over the next two to three years. Meanwhile, development works, which will be carried out in phases, are slated to start in 2024.\nAll farms in the Lim Chu Kang area will be able to stay to the end of their leases, said SFA.\xa0\nA total of 23\xa0farms, whose leases are expiring between this year and 2022, will be offered a short tenancy extension before SFA redevelops the land. Three farms whose leases expire between 2026 and 2027 will be allowed to remain there until their leases end.\nFINDING THE ‘BEST COMBINATION’\nWhile Ms Fu did not specify on Wednesday which farmers she was referring to, she noted that the authorities would “respect” the leases of local farmers.\n“All the farmers (who) have land leases from us, we will respect the land leases, we will let them ride out to the end. So we are not thinking about acquiring the land,” she said.\nHowever she added that it is important for farmers to think about ways to increase their output.\n“If we\'re really looking at making use of existing land that we have to transform the industry, we would want our conventional farmers to also think about ways to increase the yield,” she said.\xa0\n“So not all of them need to go high tech, but they need to think about how to increase the quantity of production.”\nMs Fu noted that with a “demographic shift”, a new generation of farmers could come in with better ideas.\xa0\nHowever, she also pointed out that not many of them\xa0would be prepared to “toil” in a similar way as the generation before and the industry will need to explore less labour-intensive farming methods.\n“We are in a demographic shift as well, the farmers that are in their 60s and 70s, if they\'re able to get their sons, grandsons to come in, I think that\'s a good thing. A new generation may come up with some solutions,” she explained.\n“If not, actually there are not that many Singaporeans that will be prepared to toil because it\'s actually … backbreaking work. And we know that we cannot continue to rely on migrant workers in a very significant way.”\nMs Fu added that the industry would have to raise\xa0its productivity to allow farmers to earn more.\n“They can produce more so that it is more viable\xa0and that they can have a better living. In the end, that\'s what we really want - that Singaporeans get good paying jobs and careers and businesses,” she said.\n“The farmers, they bring along with them a lot of knowledge. How do we couple that with a different way of thinking about growing? I think that\'s what we need.\n""I\'ve seen in some cases, indeed, there are second and third generations coming in, really relying on the deep expertise of the pioneer generation and adding on with technology, I think that\'s the best combination that we can look for.”\nThe event on Wednesday also marked the launch of the first grant call for the S$50 million SG Eco Fund.\nAnnounced in March, the fund aims to\xa0support ground-up projects that advance environmental sustainability in Singapore.\xa0\nThe grant call will close on Jan 31, 2021.\n', 'related_topics': ['     food ', '     agriculture ', '     SFA ']}"

      NEA to launch new scheme to help retiring veteran hawkers pass on skills, stalls to successors
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: A new scheme to help veteran hawkers pass on their businesses to aspiring hawkers is in the works.\nSenior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment Amy Khor said on Tuesday (Nov 24) that a Hawker Succession Scheme (HSS) will be rolled out early next year – with more details to be announced next month.\nUnder the scheme, veteran stallholders who would like to retire but are unable to find suitable successors will get help to be paired with\xa0aspiring hawkers whom they can pass their skills to.\nWhen the veteran hawkers retire, they can transfer the stalls to their successors. NEA said it will relax its rules so that\xa0eligible non-subsidised veteran stallholders can assign their stalls to successors who are not family members or relatives.\nThis is currently allowed only for subsidised stallholders, who are the original stallholders who were relocated from the streets in the early 1970s or allocated stalls under the Government\'s hardship scheme.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\nThe National Environment Agency (NEA) said that the scheme will benefit those with at least 15 years of experience operating hawker businesses. There are currently about 900 of such cooked food stallholders.\n“The veteran hawkers who will join the HSS are likely to be a small subset of this group. More details will be announced when ready,” NEA said.\nThe median age of hawkers is 59 years old, the agency said.\nThe scheme hopes to address a key challenge of sustaining hawker culture – passing on the culinary and business skills from one generation to the next, said Dr Khor during a visit to\xa0Ghim Moh Market and Food Centre on Tuesday.\nAn independent selection panel will advise NEA on\xa0pairing the applicants to the retiring veteran hawkers, Dr Khor said.\n“This is really an alternative pathway that the aspiring hawkers can take if they wish to continue the businesses of the retiring stallholders,\xa0instead of starting from scratch.”\xa0\nDr Khor said that this was just one of the challenges facing hawkers that a workgroup\xa0has identified. The Workgroup on Sustaining the Hawker Trade has submitted a list of recommendations to the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment for consideration.\nThe workgroup of 19 members is co-chaired by Chinatown Complex Hawkers\' Association chairman Lim Gek Meng and Timbre Group managing director Edward Chia, who is also a Member of Parliament for Holland-Bukit Timah GRC.\xa0\xa0\nOther challenges facing the hawker trade that were identified by the workgroup include the\xa0poor public perception of the trade as a profession, difficulties faced by new entrants in\xa0sustaining their businesses\xa0and limited support for productivity equipment for hawker stalls.\n""The National Environment Agency has wasted no time to implement some of the ideas that they have put forth in the report, for instance launching the Hawker Development Programme earlier this year, as well as enhancing the Hawker Productivity Grant,"" Dr Khor said.\xa0\nNEA will review the report and look at implementing other ideas suggested ""in due course"", Dr Khor added.\nMr Chia said that more than half of the workgroup members were hawkers, which helped them understand the ""pain points"" as well as the opportunities for the trade.\nOn the Hawker Succession Scheme, he said: "" As Singaporeans, we all love good food and it will be such a waste if\xa0some of these recipes or this food disappears from our hawker scene ... so the programme is targeted at those who want to hand over their recipes but can\'t find successors.""\nIt complements existing programmes to encourage new entrants into the hawker trade, such as the Incubation Stall Programme and Hawkers’ Development Programme, NEA said. These programmes offer a variety of assistance and support schemes, such as\xa0subsidised training fees, paid apprenticeships and rental subsidies to new aspiring hawkers.\nThe initial results have been ""promising"", said NEA, adding that the median age of new entrants is at 46 years old.\nOther recommendations by the workgroup include using various platforms and online resources to help hawkers network and\xa0share their knowledge, reviewing the manpower policy for hawker assistants and\xa0encouraging hawkers to use automation.\nOne initiative\xa0that\xa0went ahead last year is the Hawkers’ Seminar, a forum for hawkers to exchange ideas and facilitate sharing of best practices among the community.\nThe Hawkers’ Productivity Grant has also been extended\xa0to tools beyond kitchen automation to equipment, such as queue management systems. The funding period of the grant has been\xa0extended to Mar 31, 2023. To date, more than S$1.7 million has been disbursed to 593 market and cooked food stallholders, said NEA.\nThe report by the Workgroup on Sustaining the Hawker Trade can be found on NEA\'s website.\n', 'related_topics': ['     food ', '     National Environment Agency ', '     NEA ']}"

      Does hawker culture have a future in Singapore? Yes, but perhaps not as we know it
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: Mr Syed Habeebullah’s father used to sell mee siam on the streets from a tricycle. He and his son now run an Indian cooked food stall at Block 11 Telok Blangah Crescent Market and Food Centre.\n“I’ve been at this hawker centre since 1974, my father got the licence on November 16, 1974,” he said with pride.\nHe beamed when asked about the likely inscription of Singapore’s hawker culture on UNESCO’s intangible cultural heritage list.\n“It’s very good for Singapore’s name,” he said, but went on in the same breath to say that not many young Singaporeans want to become hawkers nowadays.\nEven as Singapore’s hawker culture is poised to be inscribed on the UNESCO list next month - formal recognition that it’s a living culture worth safeguarding -\xa0some say that it’s hard to keep the traditions and tastes alive as Singapore develops.\nChef Damian D’Silva, an advocate for heritage food, said that this is potentially “just another accolade” for Singapore.\n“Is it going to change what I think about hawker food? To be really honest with you, no. Because, because at the end of the day, right, it's a living … The only thing that I think is good for Singapore is that it encourages the younger generation,” he said.\xa0\nBut he lamented that hawker food is changing and that some dishes that take time, effort and skill to make are in danger of disappearing.\n“Char kway teow is an art, you need to fry it for 10, 15 years before you become a master. You need to know when to add the egg in, when to throw water in, when to turn the heat up or when to turn the heat down ... everything is timing,” he said.\n“It's not about just getting awards, it is about preserving food that we see disappearing in three, five, 10 years’ time, because we don't want to lose this, I don't want to lose this.”\nFood writer Annette Tan said that hawker culture is “a part of who we are”, but thinks that it’s inevitable that it will evolve with the times.\n“I think it makes me very proud that something we cherish and something that is so much a part of our lives is recognised,” she said.\xa0\n“But as times change, ingredients change, techniques change … Hawker food won't disappear because it's just so much a part of the fabric of our lives, but the quality that we are used to in the hawkers - that may change.”\nShe added: “But with everything that disappears, something new comes and replaces it.”\nHawker culture has already evolved with successive generations of Singaporeans. Decades ago, the ubiquitous hawker centres the island is known for were built to house itinerant peddlers who fed the masses as they sat on footstools by the road.\nThat worked when many families lived in kampungs and shophouses, but with new public housing came hawker centres and markets - where much of Singapore’s hawker fare now thrive in the form of traditional dishes or upstart fusion chow.\nMore change can be expected, those\xa0CNA spoke to said, as young people today are better educated, have better job opportunities and want something more than to make a basic living.\nMr Anthony Low, who chairs the hawker division of the Federation of Merchants’ Associations (FMAS), left the Singapore Armed Forces 23 years ago to run his father’s ngoh hiang stall. He was 29 then, and no one else would take up the mantle, he said.\nNow a veteran hawker with two stalls in Jurong and another one coming up at Chinatown Food Street, he recalled how he had felt “paiseh” (embarrassed in Hokkien) to serve his former colleagues at his food stall. But things are different now, he said.\n“The UNESCO nomination is an affirmation for us, I think people saw hawking as a lowly occupation … but in recent years, the reputation has improved,” the proprietor of Xin Sheng Ngoh Hiang Prawn Crackers told CNA.\n“It feels like our hard work behind the scenes to make our food better is being recognised.”\nWhile an earlier generation of hawkers laboured over hot woks and open flames out of necessity, a new generation of “hawkerpreneurs” come armed with business plans and modern culinary chops.\n“I believe that young people, when they come into the trade, they also want to achieve something. They are not satisfied with running just one stall,” said Mr Low, who is 52. “They have ideas, they want to build a business and even aim to expand overseas.”\nJiak Song, Masterchef contestant Aaron Wong’s hawker stall at Telok Blangah, serves a humble bowl of mee hoon kueh for S$3.50 to S$5, and it has attracted long queues since opening\xa0in August.\nWhile back-breaking hours are a common complaint among hawkers, Mr Wong said that his team can prepare all the ingredients for the day in two hours - even with custom-made dough, meatballs and prawn balls. His stall helpers start work at 7am, they sell out 250 bowls by 2pm\xa0and leave by 4pm, he said.\nHe believes it’s possible to blend traditional tastes and a more streamlined system of operations to make selling hawker food more palatable to a new generation.\n“I think it’s not about reinventing the food - we like our wanton mee the way it’s been since the dawn of time. I think the thing that needs to be reinvented is the way a hawker stall is operated,” he said.\nShowing this reporter around his tiny kitchen, he demonstrated\xa0how an insulated boiler and induction cookers make the stall more comfortable and safer to operate in, and all the ingredients are neatly organised.\n“These systems are not new things, they’ve been used by restaurants for a long time. It’s about incorporating them into a hawker stall,” he said. He already has plans to open a few more stalls and a central kitchen.\nWhile Mr Wong’s stall has only been operating for a few months, he’s also taken on a mentee under the National Environment Agency’s (NEA) Hawker Development Programme.\nClose to 150 participants have completed training under the programme, of which 50 have moved on to apprenticeships and 35 participants are going on to start incubation stalls. These stalls come fitted with basic equipment and rental rebates for the first 15 months of operation.\xa0\nThese recent programmes aim to train aspiring hawkers, paving an easier way into a trade that has traditionally been passed down to family members. While the median age of hawkers is 59 years old, the median age of new entrants since 2013 is 46 years old, NEA said.\nBut with the UNESCO listing in sight after two years, more can be done to keep hawker culture brewing, those in the industry said.\n“Getting awards won’t mean much unless we do something about it - if the Government takes advantage of this and looks at all the peripheral and the related opportunities this can bring,” said Makansutra founder KF Seetoh.\nSingapore hawker food can be promoted around the world, he said and he hopes that the authorities will see merit in supporting hawkers who want to venture abroad: “The possibilities will be immense.”\nMr Low of FMAS proposed having a hawker appreciation day or month to recognise stalwarts, while Mr D’Silva suggested that the hawkers that truly stand out be given “a fair rent”.\nDr Wong King Yin, a tourism and marketing lecturer from Nanyang Technological University’s Nanyang Business School, said that while the UNESCO listing will not have an immediate impact on food businesses, it can have a lasting impact on how Singaporeans identify themselves.\n“I think the value is more about how the hawker culture can connect every Singaporean and gives everyone the sense of belonging,” she said.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     hawker culture ', '     food ']}"

      Canned food: Maybe it isn’t as bad as you think
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: In the light of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is not surprising that there has been a spike in demand for canned food, which can keep for months or even years.\nAt NTUC FairPrice, Singapore’s largest supermarket retailer, the five best-selling canned foods are tuna, longans, button mushrooms, sardines and, in first place, canned pork such as luncheon meat.\nBut with their preservatives — and sometimes excessive salt, sugar and oils — can all that canned food help Singaporeans to maintain a healthy diet? Despite their reputation, canned foods are not necessarily bad for health.\nIn fact, some products can offer more nutrients than fresh food that is transported over long distances or kept for a long time. Take, for example, fresh fruits and vegetables.\n“They may lose some of their nutrients, whereas canned food (is) canned almost within hours after picking, and this can help to preserve many of the nutrients,” Parkway East Hospital dietitian Jennifer Shim told the programme Talking Point.\nHere are five things consumers should know about canned foods.\n1. THERE ARE HEALTHY CANNED OPTIONS\nThe fibre content of canned fruits and vegetables is, for the most part, equal to that of fresh fruits and vegetables.\nFor example, a study done in 2011 by researchers at Oregon State University found that canned and fresh peaches provided comparable nutrient levels.\nIn canned tomatoes, heat in the canning process releases lycopene, a nutrient with antioxidant properties. Canned food that contains a single ingredient, such as chickpeas or green peas soaked in water, is also a healthy option, said Shim.\nAnd canned fish is healthier than canned meat because fishes such as sardine and tuna are high in Omega-3, which is good for brain development and cognitive function.\n2. CANNED FOOD WINS THE TASTE TEST\nDoes canned food also measure up to the taste of fresh food?\nA taste test showed that additives such as sugar, salt and saturated fat, which often compensate for any loss in flavour and texture during the process of canning, help to ensure that there is not much compromise in that regard.\nFood bloggers Leslie Tay, Richard Neo and Seth Lui tried three dishes: Spaghetti sauce made with canned tomatoes versus fresh tomatoes; canned luncheon meat versus fresh luncheon meat; and canned chicken curry versus its fresh counterpart.\nThey all preferred the fresh chicken curry. But when it came to the spaghetti sauce, two of them preferred the canned variety, owing to its richer colour and more robust flavour.\n“You get the proper Italian plump tomatoes. And then they’re all harvested at the peak of the season. So every time you cook pasta, you know what you’re getting,” said Tay.\nAs for luncheon meat, the trio preferred the canned version with its copious amounts of sodium and fat compared to the fresh version.\n“(This is) the taste and texture that we grew up eating,” said Tay. “This is the one that foodies will eat.”\n3. DO YOU REALLY KNOW YOUR LUNCHEON MEAT?\nCanned luncheon meat also has an average shelf life of three years, which is a reason people stock up on this food.\nBut the process of extending its shelf life — by subjecting it to high heat and pressure over a prolonged period — is what breaks down the food, changes its texture and destroys certain natural flavours.\nLuncheon meat is cooked at temperatures as high as 121°C, according to Golden Bridge Foods assistant manager (research and development) Amy Chen.\nWhile this should, ideally, kill all the bacteria, “we can never be too careful”, she said. So sodium nitrite is added to inhibit bacterial growth. This preservative helps to create the slight pinkish colour of luncheon meat.\n“Without the sodium nitrite, (luncheon meat) doesn’t really have the same colour consumers are familiar with as well as … a similar taste that reminds you of childhood,” added Chen.\n4. CHEMICALS CAN MESS WITH YOUR GUT\nPreservatives such as salt, sugar and oil, if taken in “limited quantities”, are “okay”, said surgeon Grace Tan from The Surgical Oncology Clinic in Farrer Park Hospital.\nBut in the case of ultra-processed canned foods like luncheon meat, there are “lots of additives”. “Looking at the ingredient list, if you see anything that has a funny name or a long, chemical-something name, then … avoid it,” she advised.\nConsuming too much of these foods has an impact on one’s gut, which contains both good and bad bacteria and is also known as the gastrointestinal tract.\nThese bacteria are linked to how well one’s immune system performs, for example. And there is an imbalance if the bad bacteria flourishes because of the food one eats.\n“(This can) result in you having more digestive issues, like diarrhoea (and) bloating. And it can even affect other things in your health, like your appetite, your sleep … your mental health,” Tan said.\n“It can increase your risk of chronic illnesses and cancer.”\nFor that reason, Shim advised consumers to limit their intake of canned or processed meat.\n“Not only is it high in sodium and saturated fat, (but) evidence suggests that eating processed meat is associated with certain cancers, such as bowel and stomach cancers,” she said.\n5. IF OPENED, HOW LONG CAN IT KEEP IN THE FRIDGE?\nWhat many people know is that most canned foods have a shelf life of at least a year. But once the can is opened, is it safe to store the contents in the fridge for consumption later?\nPrincipal microbiologist Renugopal Jagadeesan at Marchwood Laboratory Services observed samples of opened canned button mushrooms that were kept in different conditions in the fridge over five days.\nWATCH: What’s in our canned food? (22:49)\nIn one sample, the brine water was drained and the button mushrooms were covered in cling film. In another sample, the mushrooms were transferred to a plastic box, without the brine water too.\nBoth samples were tested for the presence of bacteria. “Microbiologically, (after) five days, there was no issue. All’s clean, no bacteria,” said Renugopal.\nThere were, however, colour changes in the mushrooms by the third day, probably due to oxidation. And he does not recommend eating any canned food that has been left in the fridge beyond three days.\nHe also advised against keeping leftover food in the can. In this experiment, rust started forming on the inside of the can after a day in the fridge.\nOne should pour away the brine water and transfer the food to an airtight container instead.\nWatch this episode of Talking Point here.

      NTU researchers lead development of AI-powered 'electronic nose' to sniff out meat freshness, reduce food waste
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Scientists from the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) have led an international team to invent\xa0an ""electronic nose"" that assesses the freshness of meat with 98.5 per cent accuracy.\nThe invention could help to reduce food wastage by confirming whether meat is fit for consumption more accurately than a ""best before"" label can, the research team said in a news release on Tuesday (Nov 10).\nThe electronic nose comprises two elements that mimic the way a mammal\'s nose recognises fresh or rotting meat.\nA\xa0coloured ""barcode"" made of chitosan, a type of natural sugar,\xa0is\xa0loaded with different dyes and acts as a set of receptors for the gases produced by decaying meat.\nThe dyes change colour in response to the different types and concentrations of gases, producing\xa0a unique combination of colours that serves as a ""scent fingerprint""\xa0for the state of any meat, said NTU.\nFor example, a yellow dye in the barcode changes to blue as it reacts to bioamines\xa0produced by decaying meat. Its colour intensity changes with an increasing concentration of bioamines as the meat decays further, the university explained.\nThe research team\xa0developed a classification system\xa0– fresh, less fresh or spoiled\xa0– using an international standard that determines meat freshness, NTU\xa0said.\nThe second part of the electronic nose is a barcode ""reader"", which uses artificial intelligence (AI) to interpret the combination of colours on the barcode.\nTo make the electronic nose portable, the reader is integrated into a smartphone application that can yield results in 30 seconds, NTU said.\nThe NTU research team, which collaborated with scientists from China\'s Jiangnan University and Australia\'s Monash University,\xa0trained the AI algorithm to pick out patterns using more than 3,400 images of barcodes glued to the packaging film of chicken, fish and beef.\xa0\nSubsequent tests of the electronic nose revealed an overall 98.5 per cent accuracy rate – 100 per cent accuracy in identifying spoiled meats, and 96 to 99 per cent accuracy for fresh and less fresh meats.\nWhile electronic noses have been extensively researched, there have been bottlenecks to commercialisation due to issues with accurately detecting and identifying odour, said director of NTU\'s Innovative Centre for Flexible Devices Professor Chen Xiaodong.\nThe NTU invention offered ""both a robust sensor setup and a data analysis method that can accurately predict scent fingerprints"", he said.\n""Our proof-of-concept artificial olfactory system, which we tested in real-life scenarios, can be easily integrated into packaging materials and yields results in a short time without the bulky wiring used for electrical signal collection in some e-noses that were developed recently,"" said Prof Chen.\n""These barcodes help consumers to save money by ensuring that they do not discard products that are still fit for consumption, which also helps the environment.\n""The biodegradable and non-toxic nature of the barcodes also means they could be safely applied in all parts of the food supply chain to ensure food freshness.""\nA patent has been filed for the invention\xa0and the team is working with a Singapore agribusiness company to extend the concept\xa0to\xa0other types of perishables, NTU said.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Nanyang Technological University ', '     food ', '     technology ', '     science ']}"

      This Singapore biotech start-up is making milk without animals or humans
  </h1>, 'text': 'It’s the year 2020. Self-driving cars are being tested, flying taxis may soon become a reality, and meat substitutes can be derived from plants. Technology has come such a long way, it’s almost like we’re living in a real life sci-fi movie.\nIn Singapore, one start-up is making milk in a lab, without the need for cows, humans or any mammal, for that matter. TurtleTree Labs touts itself as the world’s first biotech company to use cell-based methods to make lab-grown milk, while retaining the same taste and composition as milk derived from natural means.\nWhile the technology may be\xa0 difficult for many grasp, it’s an innovation that has won the company several awards.\xa0\nIn July this year, the start-up was crowned the grand winner of The Liveability Challenge 2020, an annual search for solutions to some of the biggest problems faced by Southeast Asian cities. The company was awarded a grant of S$1 million by Temasek Foundation to develop its product in Singapore, and eventually scale up its solution in Asia and beyond.\nMore recently, TurtleTree Labs took home the top prize for the prestigious Entrepreneurship World Cup 2020, walking away with a cash prize of US$500,000. The global competition, which attracted 175,000 participants from 200 countries, aims to uncover the next generation of entrepreneurs.\nTurtleTree’s journey all began with cheese, the start-up’s CEO revealed. “I had a hobby of making cheese in the past. And to make good cheese, you need [high-quality] raw milk. I [travelled]\xa0all around Asia, but I soon realised that there were problems with cattle farming [in the region]. There were hormones and antibiotics being pumped into the cows, and as a result, the milk suffered,” shared Singaporean Lin Fengru.\nBack then, Lin was working at Google.\xa0It was there that she met TurtleTree’s Chief Strategist, California native Max Rye, who was formerly\xa0the CEO of a tech company in Silicon Valley. Rye had come to Google for a sharing session on transformative technologies, including companies making meat and seafood from cells.\n“After the talk, I went to him and asked if there were similar methods we could use to make milk. Back then, there was no other company doing it, so we decided to do some research into this area. We pulled in some scientists friends and last year, we managed to make some breakthroughs. We filed our patents, and now we have a team of over 20 full-time scientists and engineers.”\nCLEAN MILK FOR GENERATIONS\nSimplifying the science behind the creation of milk in a lab, Lin explained,\xa0""We’re able to isolate cells directly from freshly expressed milk. Many people might not know this, but when a mother expresses milk, within the first few hours, there are still live cells within that milk. We’re able to isolate these cells and grow them into a large number. Subsequently, we put these cells into an environment that is similar to what is in a cow udder\xa0or human breast. The cells will then convert in this lactation media, and the end result is fluid milk.”\nThe overall vision of the company, Rye shared, is to provide food in the form of milk and dairy products to the world, without having to damage the planet.\n“Today, cattle farming accounts for 37 per cent of global methane emissions. We also know it requires land, and a lot of other resources, to raise cattle,” Rye said. “How do we continue to feed people without the carbon impact? In the long term, we want to be able to provide the world with food in a sustainable way. And here in Singapore, food security is a big issue, so how do we address that?”\n“If you look at dairy, it’s the largest food segment in the world,\xa0worth US$700 billion (S$944 billion) dollars. This way, TurtleTree can really make a massive impact,” Lin added.\nWhile the company started off by creating cow’s milk, it is\xa0also exploring making breast milk and looking at the many valuable biologically active components that are present inside it.\n“The potential applications of our technology are wide-ranging. We can potentially create milk from almost any mammal. Right from the beginning, we had a huge interest from all the big infant formula milk companies,” said Rye.\nFormula milk might not be able to match the composition of breastmilk, but many women have trouble breastfeeding. TurtleTree’s lab-grown breast milk is hoping to achieve similar composition to human breast milk, the company said.\nApplying their science to create human breast milk will allow the company to take aim at a multibillion-dollar industry currently valued at US$45 billion. TurtleTree Labs hopes\xa0to strategically collaborate with different organisations and institutes to penetrate this market, potentially building revenue from an early stage.\n“We are able to use that as an opportunity to build a very strong business early on, as we set up our long-term goal to transform how the world accesses dairy,” said Rye.\n""How do we continue to feed people without the carbon impact? In the long term, we want to be able to provide the world with food in a sustainable way.""\xa0– Max Rye\nDRIVING FOR CHANGE \nTo help the company accelerate, TurtleTree Labs has received support from several agencies, including the Singapore Food Agency (SFA), Agency for Science, Technology, and Research\xa0(A*STAR), and Enterprise Singapore. “These agencies have become almost an extension of our R&D in a way,” Rye said.\nThe decision to be based in Singapore has proven to be the right move. “We probably wouldn’t get as much support if we were in a different city, or a different country. The government agencies are really behind us because of Singapore’s goal to produce 30 per cent of its own nutritional needs by 2030, so we’re just very fortunate to be here,” Lin added.\nAs intriguing as the technology sounds, both founders are acutely aware that consumer acceptance is one of the hurdles they will run into. “Because the technology is so novel, consumer acceptance, regulatory issues, these are challenges we’re going to face,” Rye acknowledged.\nWhile skeptics may exist, Lin and Rye believe that it’s the younger generation who would resonate with the company’s goal. “We are very fortunate because young people these days are driving for change. They really want to make the right decisions when it comes to choosing the food that they consume,” Lin said.\n“It’s not just the acceptance of new technologies like this. We’re at a time when it has become expected for corporations and big companies\xa0to create\xa0solutions that don’t destroy the planet. This is what the young folks are pushing for. They want to have a better world to live in. If we can build a solution that is aligned with what they’re looking for, there’s a big win there for both sides,” Rye enthused.\nAs part of the company’s corporate social responsibility (CSR) efforts, TurtleTree is also collaborating with the Smithsonian Institute on a project to create milk for endangered animals in captivity, such as elephants and snow leopards.\nIn particular, snow leopards in captivity tend to attack their young. Thus, the mother needs to be separated from her cubs. There are also orphaned baby elephants that do not survive in captivity, as the milk they receive is not as nutrient-dense as milk derived from the mother elephant. \xa0\n“When we first announced that we were going to make cow\'s milk, we had all these press reports go out. All of a sudden, there was interest from areas we never expected. The Smithsonian Institute reached out to us to ask if our technology could help these animals in captivity. And for us, it’s very inspiring. With our technology, we can help the most vulnerable baby mammals on this planet,” said Rye.\n""We are very fortunate because young people these days are driving for change. They really want to make the right decisions when it comes to choosing the food that they consume.”\xa0– Lin Fengru\nMAKING A MEANINGFUL IMPACT\nWhile Lin and Rye have always been involved in the tech world during their careers, they now feel like they’re making an actual impact on the world.\n“Even though I’ve been an executive for so many years, I always questioned if I was doing anything to help this planet. I whined about it, I complained about it. But yet, I wasn’t a part of the solution. So now that I have this opportunity, I can directly use my leadership skills to make an impact,” Rye mused.\nLooking towards what the future holds for TurtleTree Labs in the next five to ten years, Lin said, “We imagine most of the dairy products out there to have the TurtleTree logo on the cover, showing that this milk was sourced through TurtleTree methods or technology.”\nThe company’s logo resembles both the cross section of a tree, as well as a thumbprint. Explaining the rationale behind both the logo and company name, Lin said, “Turtles and trees are symbols of longevity, and we believe in the longevity of the animals and planet.”\nTurtleTree also hopes to play a bigger role in solving the issue of food security in Singapore, shared Rye. “In a place like Singapore, if you have your own dairy and your own milk, that’s going to be a huge change. You will be a lot less reliant on the global supply chain, and during this pandemic, we’ve seen that this is actually very fragile. We would love to be a part of the Singapore food story.”\n""In a place like Singapore, if you have your own dairy and your own milk, that’s going to be a huge change... We would love to be a part of the Singapore food story.""\xa0– Max Rye\n', 'related_topics': ['     Singapore ', '     Tech ', '     food ', '     Profiles ']}"

      To save an old-school ‘zi char’ stall from COVID-19, a family comes together
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: He did not want his children to know just how badly COVID-19 had hit his business.\nWhenever they called to ask about his zi char stall, Albert Choy Xiong Fa — or Uncle Albert to his customers — would only say he was slightly affected.\nBut business had dropped by 70 per cent, and from 30 fish heads sold daily to zero. At one point during the “circuit breaker”, he was collecting S$100 plus in sales each day, compared with S$1,000 plus before the pandemic.\n“He just kept it from all of us,” recalled Chris, his 34-year-old son.\n“He’d say, ‘I think it’s fine’ … But you could sense that he wasn’t convincing. Then you sort of worry, yet you don’t really want to ask further, in case it hurts his feelings.”\nHis daughter Tina, 37, said: “(He’s) a typical dad figure, like, ‘I can manage.’”\nIndeed, he was soldiering on and dutifully paying his workers’ salaries. But within two to three months, he lost S$10,000. “I wasn’t just worried but very worried,” Uncle Albert, the chef and owner of Ji Xiang Seafood, told CNA Insider.\n""I’ve been here for so many years, and I didn’t want to let it go … I really held on to it for those few months. It was very tough.""\n“Here” is a coffee shop in Old Airport Road, which he moved to in 2003 — a move precipitated by the outbreak of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) coronavirus, which had caused his previous restaurant business to close.\n“In these 17 years, I didn’t think that I’d meet with this virus again. This time, the virus is even more severe,” said the 58-year-old, speaking in Mandarin.\nHe thought things would improve after the circuit breaker. But when it was extended for another month, he was ready to admit defeat for the second time.\n“I knew I’d lose a lot,” he said. “I didn’t want to carry on.”\nWhat he did not know, however, was that his children would swing into action when they found out the extent of his losses.\nAnd what was also different now was that his old-school dishes, such as fried intestines, white pepper crab and deep-fried fish roe, could find new customers in this digital era.\nDespite his doubts about going online, he found a way forward with his children’s help. But it has not been easy.\nA TOUCH RESISTANT\nThat it took Uncle Albert so long to disclose his troubles to his children came as no surprise to Chris, who recognised “that’s exactly him”. “He’s a very strong person. He supports the family … He was always there,” he said.\n“Growing up, we also had our fair share of moments when we needed his help. For me, it was financial. So he came in to help me — no words said. (He) didn’t say, ‘Hey son, I’m doing this for you. Are you aware?’”\nIt was Tina who first heard from her father that he was thinking of calling it quits. And her first thought was that she could not let him walk away like that.\n“If he doesn’t have the stall any more, then what’s he going to do? I know he can go and work for someone else, but I know that’s not what he wants,” she said.\nHe also had to pay the medical bills for his wife’s late-stage colorectal cancer, which is now in remission.\nHe figured he could find a job that pays S$4,000 to $5,000 a month, which is not more than half of what he used to earn when times were good.\nBut his daughter latched onto another idea after she saw the Facebook group, Hawkers United — Dabao 2020, a community initiative for hawkers to promote their food and take orders for delivery.\nWATCH: An old-school hawker goes digital (7:19)\xa0\nHe was not hopeful and even a touch resistant. While this was a cost-free platform, unlike the delivery apps whose commissions he maintained were too high, he had another objection on “principle”.\n“I hope every customer would finish their food in front of me and then tell me that the food is very delicious. And when they order takeaway, I’d tell them the food won’t be as nice,” he said.\n“If people eat at my stall, I can tell you that out of 100 people, 98 of them would have a satisfaction rate of 98. If they order takeaway … my food would lose some of the score.”\nAnd then, he feared, customers would not come back. That would be a blow to someone who takes pride in his “retro dishes” that many others are no longer cooking, and who makes everything himself instead of using ready-made options.\nSo he had reservations about going digital, but he agreed to give the suggestion a try.\n“When you’re driven into a corner, you don’t really have a choice. That’s how he gave in to my sister,” said Chris. “He didn’t want to burden us, but we insisted.”\nTHE FIRST DAY\nThe hardest challenge, however, still lay ahead of them.\nTina, who works in customer service for a multinational company, had some experience from her own online business selling herbs. And she found drivers to make the deliveries for her father’s stall.\nBut she did not expect her “brief” Facebook appeal for help for her father’s “old-fashioned” stall to go viral.\n“I knew it would get some traction, but I didn’t think it would be so crazy,” she said. “I posted (it) in the afternoon. And then boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.”\nShe was flooded with responses via WhatsApp, and what with liaising with one of her father’s workers on the orders as well as with the drivers on the deliveries, she could not reply in time to many “eager” customers.\n“I was so stressed out because (there were) so many direct messages … I was like, ‘Oh, this could be big for my dad.’ And I wanted to help him,” she recounted.\n(But) I only had one pair of hands. Then I felt very bad. Some of the customers got angry.\nShe eventually replied to all of them, apologising to those whose orders she missed or could not fulfil.\n“After we finished everything, I just sat down. Then I started crying because I felt that I could’ve done more for my dad,” said an emotional Tina. “I felt that on my own I had no power (to help him).”\nBut help she did. Her father was so busy in the kitchen that he was “exhausted” that night. “He wouldn’t talk to me! He was like, ‘I want to go home and rest,’” she said.\nAnd in the end, she found the responses overwhelming in more ways than one. “You can see how all Singaporeans … want to help these true-blue hawkers,” she observed. “Very stressful, but it was a very nice experience.”\nIt was not, however, something she could cope with on a daily basis amid her work, her own business and her three children. And the teething problems needed sorting.\nSo when her brother called to find out how the first day had gone, she broke down and asked if he could help.\nChris, an insurance adviser, spoke to his wife, Vivian. Together the parents of two agreed not only to help but to take over the online effort.\n‘LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL’\nThe first thing the couple did was to set up a spreadsheet system to streamline the process for customer orders.\nTina also spoke to her husband, Rob Willock, whose expertise was in marketing, and he decided to create a website for the stall. It was up within days, with photos and videos the children took of their father at work.\nAnd it became the main vehicle for the online orders. To make the system even easier to handle, the children came up with set menus, instead of an a la carte menu with all the many dishes.\n“The price was what we struggled (with) the most,” said Tina. “Everyone was coming out with a lot of attractive packages, and we were going as low as S$30 with free delivery just to help my dad to get by.\n“If you want to talk about profit, (it was) really not much.”\nIt was, however, enough for their father to realise that selling his food online was “doable” as business “picked up slowly” over a two-week period during the circuit breaker.\nIt culminated with a lot of advance orders for Mother’s Day, when business was “extremely good”, he recalled — and again for Father’s Day. “Then I saw some light at the end of the tunnel,” said Uncle Albert.\nThe one thing he had insisted on was that the food collected by the drivers had to reach the customers within 30 minutes, so that it would not turn cold.\nThis required Chris to group the deliveries into batches of three and to plan the routes, which “wasn’t easy”, observed his sister.\nBut their father was pleased with the results. “They all were able to achieve that,” he said. “The feedback (customers) gave me was that they were very satisfied with my food.”\nThat was “very important to him”, Tina noted. “Every day, he’d ask me, ‘What’s the customer feedback?’” she recalled. “He didn’t care how much he made; he just cared about what the customers (said) about … the food.”\nVivian had been actively engaging and thanking customers. And in some cases, they sent their compliments to the chef by video, to show him their children eating.\n“You see, they’re so happy. Uncle Albert, thank you,” he cited as an example of what the parents said.\nThey give me money to earn, but they say thank you to me.\nGROWING CLOSER\nThe response from Singaporeans was one of the things that did surprise Chris in all of this. “They started to tag other people. So you could see that they were drawn to help. So that was very heart-warming,” he said.\nHis sister was equally surprised at how gamely her father responded by, for example, agreeing to being filmed for the website, which includes a thank-you video to his new customers.\n“He’s a joker. He likes to say random things and joke, but that video isn’t something that my dad would do,” she said.\n“So when my brother asked him to do it, and he did it, that made me (be) like, ‘Whoa!’”\nPeering behind the lens as this happened, Chris remembers it as a moment when “you sort of had that warm feeling that you’re doing things right”.\nHis family may not be the expressive kind — “classical Asians”, he said wryly — but the children could see what their efforts meant to their father.\n“When he saw that business flowed in, he expressed his gratitude and said, ‘I couldn’t have done it without you all,’” recalled Chris.\nThe family also grew closer, said Uncle Albert.\n“I won’t say thank you to them … But I’d (think of) a very practical way, such as going to their homes. My wife and I would go to their homes and buy food that they like to eat,” he said.\n“We started to talk on the phone every day. If there weren’t this pandemic, we might meet once or twice a month. Now it’s different already. Now they’d call and ask about the business every week.”\nBusiness returned to about 80 per cent of pre-pandemic levels after the Old Airport Road coffee shop was closed for renovations throughout August.\nWith that, his stall has temporarily paused online orders because of a manpower issue. Three of his staff returned to Malaysia during the circuit breaker and “can’t come back”.\nHe is left with four workers and is “trying very hard to find Singaporeans to work”, but to no avail.\nAs far as he is concerned, however, the “difficult times” are over. “(My income) is stable already,” he said. “I don’t have to worry about it any more.”\nWith other countries seeing a second wave of infections, Tina thinks it is worth keeping the online operations. Chris even suggested to his father that he expand the business.\n“Having an opportunity or a platform to share a dream with (my) father … is something that I can consider a breakthrough,” he said. “You can’t call it a blessing but something unexpected, something good that came out of (COVID-19).”\n', 'related_topics': ['     COVID-19 ', '     food ', '     CNA Insider ']}"

      Singapore's top restaurants buy their produce from local farmers; so should you
  </h1>, 'text': ""It is the challenge of the ages: Growing and delivering fresh food to Singapore’s ever-growing population with the limited land we possess. Yet farming is a calling that a small group of individuals have taken up. Never mind the lack of land, natural resources and manpower. These things have never stopped our farmers, whose passion lies in growing food for the country.\nTake Liao Chuan Huat, who established Quan Fa vegetable farm in 1999 with the simple goal of feeding his family better. Certified organic the following year, Liao grew his crops so that he was able to sell vegetables to Singaporeans who made the trek to his farm in the Lim Chu Kang area just to buy them.\nIn 2008, Liao’s son Jun Jie joined the growing family business and took his father’s produce to wet markets, supermarkets, and to consumers online.\nQuan Fa Organic Farm’s growth was well on track, save for one snag: Last year, it lost its two-hectare plot as its lease came to an end. It moved to its current plot at Neo Tiew which, at almost 4,500 sq. ft., is but a quarter of the size of its former plot. Production dipped accordingly and it now imports vegetables from Thailand, Australia and Cameron Highlands to sustain and grow its business.\nWhen the COVID-19 pandemic hit earlier this year, it took yet another toll on the business as border restrictions curtailed the supply chain.\n“It was frustrating,” said Quan Fa’s marketing manager Lays Poh. “The upside was that there was demand, but just not enough supply.” Undaunted, the company wrote a proposal to the Singapore Food Agency, detailing this simple economics tenet in a bid to secure the plot that sits beside it now.\n“If we get it, it means we can produce more. But we will never go back to the same space that we had before,” said Poh.\n\n\nHOME TO ROOST\nToh Thye San Farm, too, began as a small family business. Though it was incorporated in 1979, its eponymous founder had been plying his trade as a chicken farmer who sold his fowl at wet markets for more than 20 years before that.\nToday, Toh Thye San supplies ethically farmed chicken and other meats to supermarkets and Singapore’s food services industry, including high-end restaurants such as Iggy’s and Burnt Ends.\n\n\n A big congratulations to our chicken farmer Kenny and his team at @tohthyesanfarm (Anxin) for being the first company in South East Asia to achieve sustainable farming practices and humane treatment from HFAC, an international non profit organisation which is a world leader in ethical farming practices. This is a huge step for farming in this part of the world! �� ����\nA post shared by  The Fishwives (@thefishwives) on Apr 3, 2019 at 4:06pm PDT\nNow in its third generation, the family business has established farms in Malaysia to circumvent the issue of space, but cites cost and manpower as their main challenges. These it has side-stepped with automation – Toh Thye San Farm\xa0was among the first poultry suppliers to automate its slaughtering process. Come next year, it will move into the new Singapore Poultry Hub, the first smart and green factory for the industry in Singapore.\nA joint venture with four other poultry companies – Kee Song Holdings, Sinmah Holdings, Tong Huat Poultry Processing Factory, and Tysan Food – the Singapore Poultry Hub will help the farms increase productivity and achieve new economies of scale.\n“For example, instead of five slaughtering lines, we will all share one. And we will have an automatic cutting line that cuts chickens into eight or nine pieces (with less need for manpower),” said the company’s head of projects Kenny Toh.\n\n\nTEACH A MAN TO FISH\nAnd then there is Wong Jing Kai, who is so passionate about fish farming – a so-called sunset industry – that he is looking to revive it for these modern times.\n“I met (kelong owner) Ah Hua more than six years ago and after chatting with him, realised that there are lots of gaps to be explored in this (fish farming) industry,” said the 30-year-old, who's now the company's managing director.\n“What people considered a sunset industry wasn’t that to me. It is only considered a sunset industry because people don’t want to do the work. But there are so many opportunities, such as the fact that there was no local seafood directly available to the public.”\nAs Wong saw it, the best option was selling his seafood online at affordable rates. Today, Ah Hua Kelong sells its wares to Singaporeans on its website, complete with doorstep delivery, and supplies produce to restaurants like the Michelin-starred Labyrinth, which proudly state their provenance on the menus.\n\n\n Barely 1% of Singapore is farmland. Yet 90% of Restaurant Labyrinth’s menu is locally-sourced, as Chef Han Li Guang strives to create a truly Singaporean cuisine. Discover #VisitSingapore’s food obsession at go.gov.sg/tasteobsession-labyrinth\nA post shared by  Restaurant Labyrinth (@restaurantlabyrinth) on Feb 4, 2020 at 8:12pm PST\nIt also boasts its own restaurant, Scaled By Ah Hua Kelong and a franchise outlet Ah Hua Kelong @ Riang, which\xa0help\xa0to showcase and educate consumers about the farm’s produce such as locally grown mussels and crabs.\nHis goal is to now expand Ah Hua Kelong, while raising awareness about the merits of fresh, locally grown seafood. Next on Wong’s agenda is harnessing technology to update the farm and business.\n“But to do that, we need sales. We’ve tried to put in small things where we can. We’ve brought in solar panels so that we can reduce the oil\xa0usage to run the generator. I’m now looking into death rates and survivability – the more the fish survive, the more we can sell,” he said. “I’m also trying to get our farms certified sustainable.”\n\n\nGROWING A NATIONAL GARDEN \nA pioneer in Singapore’s urban farming landscape, Edible Garden City has been key to the rising awareness of local produce among Singaporeans. Since its inception in 2012, it has championed the Grow Your Own Food movement by first helping people grow edible gardens in their homes and workplaces.\nToday, it boasts three production farms in Queenstown, Raffles City Shopping Centre and Funan, where it grows up to 50 varieties of vegetables, fruit and edible flowers for restaurants and households.\n“While Edible Garden City began with the business of edible landscaping, we have over the years understood the importance of a diversified business model that focuses not only on food production, but that also actively aims to build awareness of local farming in Singapore,” said a spokesperson for the company.\n“Hence, besides growing food and building gardens, over the years, we have expanded into offering tours and workshops, as well as growing kits and even lifestyle products.”\n\n\nSUPPORTING OUR LOCAL FARMERS\n\n\n Local state of mind. #theguildsg #proud2bsg #supportlocal #ediblegardencity #education #farmtotable #kinyanagrotech #organic #lovesgproduce #tohthyesanfarm #jurongfrogfarm #anxinchicken #freeroamingchicken #restaurantfamily #peopleoftheguildsg\nA post shared by  The Guild Singapore (@theguildsingapore) on Oct 5, 2018 at 2:28am PDT\nWhile Singapore now imports 90 per cent of our food, Edible Garden City is optimistic that we can accelerate food production to meet the country’s “30 by 30” goal (i.e. produce 30 percent of our country’s nutritional needs by 2030).\n“Every Singaporean can do our part to help Singapore become more food resilient. These efforts are not limited to buying local produce. It could be by\xa0volunteering, talking about local producers or even patronising eateries that buy from local farmers,” the spokesperson continued.\nQuan Fa Organic Farm’s Lays Poh added, “Singaporeans have this mindset that if it’s imported, it must be good. But we want Singaporeans to understand that with traditional farming practices like ours, you can see the source; the produce is harvested and sent straight to the market. Cargo freight takes about seven days from overseas, so the freshness just isn’t there anymore. The government has to help raise awareness of this and support the farmers as well.”\n“Self-sustainability is a very distant future for us, especially if you look at (rearing) chickens,” said Kenny Toh. “It’s a very land-intensive industry and bears hygiene risks because of disease and water pollution. Perhaps it’s possible with vegetables or seafood, but it would require a lot of help from the government.”\nAh Hua Kelong’s Wong says that imported produce provides variety, but locals should consider Singapore-farmed produce as an option more often. As he succinctly put it: “We should be a source option, not a second choice.”\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Singapore ', '     food ', '     Restaurants ', '     Fine dining ']}"

      For F&amp;B outlets, COVID-19 is a wake-up call. Here are seven changes they can make
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: Businessman Ashok Melwani calls it a “Darwinian extinction event”.\nBetween January and July, 1,242 food and beverage (F&B) outlets in Singapore were permanently shuttered, according to data from the Department of Statistics.\n“It’s like a meteor that came along, and I think any of us who were fragile got crushed,” says Melwani, whose 23-year-old dining fixture, Modesto’s, was one of them.\nThe meteor was, of course, COVID-19. But there had been indications of the fragility of the F&B scene before then — with “two forces that have worked so strongly against us” in the past few years, he says.\n“Labour costs have gone up exponentially,” cites the 62-year-old. “Rent also has gone up, like, (by) double.\n“When you talk to the Reit (Real Estate Investment Trust), it’s always ‘no’. They’re totally not interested to hear the words ‘rent decrease’. And they’d rather take the risk of leaving a place empty than to give a sitting tenant a break.”\nRestaurants were taking a risk too. While many businesses may have four to six months of cash flow, restaurants usually operate on two, which means trouble if a restaurant does not turn in a profit for two months.\n“We were too big,” Melwani says of his own restaurant. “Turnover is vanity, profit is reality, but cash flow is the only necessity.”\nSingapore is not alone, however, in having its deficiencies exposed. For the first time, restaurants round the world are going through the same challenge.\n“The restaurant industry is obviously destroyed,” says legendary chef and New York-based restaurateur Eric Ripert. “This COVID-19 crisis — it’s something that we’ve never seen.”\nThe pandemic is proving to be a wake-up call for the global food industry, with change needed for things to take a turn for the better.\nSo how can the F&B sector become more resilient and sustainable? There could be seven ways, highlighted on the programme For Food’s Sake!\nWATCH: Shattered fragility? What COVID-19 revealed about the restaurant industry (4:03)\n1. CALL TIME ON EXPANSION\nRunning a successful restaurant can be a costly affair. Consistently executing great food with amazing service means hiring great cooks and well-trained staff — which is more than 30 per cent of revenue.\nThe cost of raw ingredients can approach 30 per cent. Rent can come up to 25 per cent. Then there are equipment, utilities and marketing costs.\nIn 2018, the average profit margin in Singapore’s restaurants was 5.5 per cent, reported the Singapore Business Review.\n“Even for the very best in the industry, profits can be less than 10 per cent,” says programme host, chef and restaurateur Ming Tan.\nDespite the thin margins, tight cash flow and long hours, an average of 808 new restaurants enter the market every year.\nAnd 22-year industry veteran Beppe de Vito, the owner of the il Lido Group of restaurants, believes the restaurant scene is oversaturated.\n“We’ve seen way too big of an expansion over the past few years. The entry level to operate in this business is too low,” says the man with a Michelin star under his belt.\n“They’ll all increase your average rental, they’ll have to pay your staff a little bit more to steal them from you, and they end up setting up something that may not last even five years.”\nToday, however, there is the pandemic to be reckoned with. “During this period, plenty of restaurants are going to shut their doors. And as a chef, this is tough to see,” says Ming. “But maybe it’s about time.”\n2. RELY MORE ON AUTOMATION\nFor years, the government has called for the F&B industry to rely less on manpower and more on automation. Incentive schemes have been offered, while foreign labour restrictions and levies have been a direct hit to restaurants.\nIt is hard to find Singaporeans willing to work in F&B, but the industry’s labour-intensive ways are also “costly and, compared to other industries, really inefficient”, acknowledges Ming.\nHaving enough staff for “key peak periods” — each in a specific role, from floor manager to waiter to sommelier — often means “being overstaffed in the least busy period”.\nSo it was an eye-opener to him to meet Ella, a state-of-the-art robotic barista with a sleek, metallic arm. According to its creator, it can make around 200 cups of coffee per hour.\n“She makes exactly the same quality as our top barista, but at four times the speed,” says Crown Digital founder and chief executive officer Keith Tan.\nIn a speed test, Ella made two cappuccinos and one latte five minutes faster than Ming. But in a blind test on taste, a panel of three coffee lovers all preferred his coffee.\nIn future, Ella could be repurposed and made more versatile. “We might want to turn her into cooking some food,” suggests Tan.\nWith its price tag of S$150,000, however, not all restaurants would be able to afford Ella right now.\n3. RETHINK LOCATION\nOne hawker who recently took a gamble is Fishball Story owner Douglas Ng, whose stall used to be in Timbre+, a food court in Ayer Rajah catering mostly for office workers.\nAfter the pandemic started, his sales dropped by 80 per cent as there was less and less of an office crowd. So he moved to MacPherson, an area with an older demographic, where he is surrounded by residential blocks instead.\nHe saves S$6,000 on his annual rent, and he has double the space he had previously. It was a calculated risk, and he is “so glad” to have taken it because business has been “better” with people working from home.\n“I was in Timbre+ for four years (and was) happy there,” says the 29-year-old. “But then again, you have to be realistic. It’s not (about) whether the place is nice or the customers there are very nice to you.\n“COVID-19 won’t disappear so quickly. The environment's changed, the whole food industry will change, and people calling for delivery — all this — is here to stay.”\nIn the F&B industry, location is one way to ensure a steady flow of customers, but at a price, with rents that are sometimes up to 60 per cent higher than in less desirable locations.\nWhat makes a great location, however, and how does it help with financial sustainability? Ng’s advice for those in the industry who are looking to relocate is that they need not look for a “very luxurious” place.\n“You never know if you’re going to succeed or not. But it’s less painful if the investment is smaller,” he says.\n4. BE COMMUNITY-CENTRIC\nPositioning is an important part of staying sustainable, thinks DP Architects director Ng San Son.\nBut he suggests that this can be done by establishing a new norm, namely by forming a “relationship with the community”, be it through events or “bespoke dishes for that particular district”.\nHe cites the Home Team NS clubhouse in Khatib, deep in the heartlands, as an example of a space for F&B where people can “get excited” and engaged in activities. “It’s about contributing back to the community,” he says.\nIn a nutshell, he advocates that restaurants should be a bigger part of the local community so that in times of need, the community can rally round to ensure that restaurants in their area stay in business.\n5. VENTURE INTO THE CLOUD\nSome businesses are going in the opposite direction, venturing away from the community and into cloud kitchens. These are large, shared facilities where many different restaurants can prepare food for takeaway and delivery.\nIan Lin’s company, the Dynasty Group, runs 21 outlets selling salad bowls and Thai food, among other things. But his newest brand, Lady Boss Mala, is unlike the others: A virtual one created just for GrabKitchen.\n“The rent's much lower,” he says. “At the same time, when you run a virtual brand, you don’t need a front counter. There’s no cashier, there’s no waiter or someone to clear the plates.”\nThere are over 20 F&B brands at GrabKitchen Hillview, which is Grab Singapore’s first central kitchen, and 18 brands at its second GrabKitchen, in Aljunied. Dine-in or takeaway customers at the kitchens can order from any of the brands there.\nNot only does GrabFood Singapore senior director Dilip Roussenaly think cloud kitchens are here to stay, he also calls it the future of dining, under a “less volatile model”.\n“Labour isn’t going to be as intensive … You’re only focusing on what you do best — you cook, and that’s it. And that benefits all the merchants,” he says.\n“Even though we have a dine-in (area), it’s not optimised for dine-in, so the rent is low. With this, we de-risk the venture for merchants. That’s exactly what it is.”\n6. SELL MEAL KITS\nBut what if owners do not want to give up their shop front? They could draw inspiration from one restaurant owner who took a leap forward with his crispy pork belly.\nAmid the pandemic, Dylan Ong of The Masses managed to sell more than 10,000 pieces in two months, without having customers come to the restaurant.\nHis is a vacuum-packed frozen dish that customers can make at home anytime they want, as it can keep for up to a year.\nAll that is needed is to roast it for 25 minutes in the oven, an air fryer or a toaster. And it is created to taste no different from the restaurant’s typical fare — convenience food taken to another level.\n“Roasted pork belly is a well-loved dish … But it takes about three days to cook a perfectly (good) pork belly,” says Ong, 33. “What we did was minimise … all the things that you need to do.”\nAccording to a 2018 Nielsen report, the proportion of Singaporeans who had purchased restaurant deliveries or a meal-kit service online was 11 percentage points higher than the global average.\nSo pre-cooked gourmet meals can be a new revenue stream for restaurateurs here, and they can also utilise their teams better. This was the case for Ming when he released his first gourmet DIY meal kit: Damn Easy Hokkien Mee.\nIt was more difficult to make than he expected, as it must be able to keep for up to a week in the fridge. But it helped to bump up his sales by 30 per cent.\n7. HOW ABOUT MINI-GREENHOUSES?\nAlthough safe distancing is still bad news for revenue, since restaurants cannot accommodate as many diners as before, one restaurant in Amsterdam found an opportunity to embrace this new situation and stand out from the rest.\nA lot of Dutch restaurants are tiny places full of “gezelligheid”, which means cosiness and conviviality. But the restaurant Mediamatic ETEN reinvented cosiness when it conceived of “quarantine greenhouses” in April, when Amsterdam was still in lockdown.\nThe vegan-friendly restaurant has a greenhouse where it grows most of the produce it serves, hence the mini-greenhouses for its customers to dine in as a safe, creative solution.\nEven the staff cannot enter these mini greenhouses. Instead, they serve the food balanced on a wooden plank. Is this the future of dining too, or a new normal?\n“It’s good to create those possibilities and see where they can lead to,” says Mediamatic Eten chef Giulia Soldati, adding that if other restaurants copy the concept, it would be a “nice message that … we could inspire other people”.\nDutch chef and television host Rene Pluijm describes his experience of dining at the restaurant as “safe” but also “very comfortable”. “And you have complete privacy. It’s a fantastic idea,” he says.\n“What these guys at Mediamatic are doing right now is they’re turning something terrible … into something positive, into a new concept. So what I learnt here is that new concepts are born based on something that’s maybe negative.\n“This is completely new, and it might work.”\nOr as Ming puts it, “There’s no way forward unless we’re flexible and we evolve.”\nWatch this episode of For Food's Sake! here.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     COVID-19 ', '     food ', '     CNA Insider ']}"

      Instant noodle obsession: 5 quirky twists to the classic Indomie in Jakarta
  </h1>, 'text': 'JAKARTA: It is the perfect meal for cash-strapped university students and late-shift workers with limited options on what they can eat.\xa0\nBut for some people in Indonesia and elsewhere around the world, these plastic-wrapped, MSG-laden\xa0instant noodles are more than life savers in times of hardship. They have become a staple food, beloved for their affordability and practicality.\nAnd no instant noodles are more famous than Indomie in Indonesia.\xa0The brand, which first appeared in 1972,\xa0is so well-known and loved in the country that it has become the generic term to describe instant noodles.\xa0\xa0\nSince the creation of instant noodles, people have been modifying them according to their tastes and preferences.\n\n\nSome like their noodles slightly undercooked and crunchy while others prefer them overcooked and soft. There are those who find the seasoning powder\xa0which comes with the noodles not flavourful enough\xa0and add in chopped chillis, shallots and spring onions. Some like their noodles with meat and egg, be it\xa0hard-boiled, sunny side up or whisked into the broth.\nBut these additions are mild compared to the unique creations on offer by some of these Jakarta restaurants -\xa0burgers, pizzas and omelettes.\n“It’s all trial and error,” Melissa Liondini, the owner of Be-Em Cafe, told CNA. “We tried to come up with dishes no one has ever seen before.”\nAlthough some customers prefer the original look and taste of the Indomie, there are those who are drawn to the restaurant’s unique spin on the humble meal. Be-Em’s instant noodle dishes have\xa0drawn thousands of curious customers to the small restaurant\xa0located on the eastern edge of Jakarta, a 40-minute drive from downtown. \xa0\n“They put us on the map,” Liondini said of her creations.\nZaenal Abidin, a foodie who has been sharing recipes on his YouTube channel, said instant noodles proved to be so versatile that he has so far created at least 20 different Indomie-based dishes, and requests from his followers to make more continued to pour in.\n\n\n“We can use Indomie\xa0as fillings, as bread replacements or as a wrap. The only limit is our imagination,” he told CNA.\nDespite this, there are not that many restaurants in Jakarta which sell\xa0these crazy creations, with many opting to serve the more popular classic instant noodles.\nCNA visited a few eateries where people can savour these contemporary noodles in Jakarta.\xa0Here are five options: \xa0\nINSTANT NOODLES AS BURGER BUNS\xa0\nIndomie burger is Be-Em\'s\xa0signature dish.\nThe fat, juicy beef patty is sandwiched between instant noodles moulded into cylindrical ""buns"" and the whole thing is smothered in a\xa0rich, creamy sauce.\nThe instant noodle buns are soft and have a hint of the savoury Indomie seasoning, which accented the tender burger meat and the crunchy lettuce and cucumber, while spinach and tomato add texture and flavour.\nINSTANT NOODLES TURNED PIZZA BASE\nThe tiny cafe also boasts Indomie\xa0pizza, which uses baked instant noodles in place of a pizza bread. Only one variant is available, which is noodle pizza topped with margherita sauce and mozzarella cheese.\nThe noodles, lightly seasoned with Indomie\'s own seasoning powder,\xa0are cooked and hydrated using boiling water before they are baked to recreate the crunchiness of a pizza crust, which the cafe managed fairly successfully.\n\n\nBut customers will not get that perfectly-congealed cheese strands which stretch from a slice of pizza as it is being lifted, nor that rich and milky bite of a layer of generously portioned mozzarella.\nKEBAB WITH INSTANT NOODLE FILLING\nKebab was given an instant noodle twist at Be-Em. Indomie noodles are used as a filling inside a kebab flatbread, which has been baked until it is dry and crispy.\nThe dish is then topped with smoked beef and mixed vegetables.\nThe dish does not resemble a typical doner kebab as it is served in a\xa0bowl instead of being wrapped in the flatbread.\nBut the combination works well, with the softness of the noodles complementing the crunchiness of the savoury flatbread. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\nINSTANT NOODLE PANCAKE\xa0\xa0\nKeibar is a restaurant chain popular among youths in the suburbs for its sleek decor and affordable menu. It is mainly known for its toasts with a wide range of fillings, from ice cream and Oreo to Toblerone chocolate. \xa0\nBut customers also come for its instant noodles, and one unique creation is the Indomie martabak\xa0(the Indonesian version of stuffed meat pancake\xa0murtabak) which has become a favourite among its regular patrons.\nLike the usual martabak, this instant noodle version has a crunchy crust and a soft and chewy interior.\nIt is savoury and delectable on its own, but customers can also have the dish topped with minced meat and a generous portion of mayonnaise, which costs a little extra. \xa0\xa0\nINDOMIE WITH SPICES FOR EXTRA KICK\nAkademie, a\xa0trendy, two-storey restaurant located just minutes away from Jakarta’s business centre, is a hit among office workers looking for a quick and cheap meal.\nAkademie, a portmanteau of academy and\xa0mie (noodle in Indonesian), is an instant noodle specialist.\nWhile it used to boast more daring experiments like Indomie carbonara and Indomie aglio e olio, the COVID-19 pandemic had forced the restaurant to cut down its menu and focus\xa0on dishes that sell.\n\n\nBut the restaurant still has some unique twists to the humble dish, combining instant noodles with different kinds of Indonesia’s traditional spices and sambal chilli pastes.\nFor instance, its Indomie sambal matah features stir-fried instant noodles with sambal matah (chopped chilli drenched in hot oil).\xa0Garnished with freshly cut chillis and\xa0deep fried shallots and served with a halved poached egg,\xa0it is the perfect instant noodle dish for those who love a little bit of heat.\xa0\nThe only problem is: One is not enough.\xa0\nRead this story in Bahasa Indonesia here.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Jakarta ', '     food ']}"

      Are gourmet Korean ingredients the next big thing in the culinary scene?
  </h1>, 'text': ""When it comes to Korean food, most people think about fried chicken, bulgogi and kimchi anything. But while this hearty comfort fare certainly hits the spot when the craving strikes, there is more to Korean cuisine than these K-popularised dishes.\nIn recent years, the growing fame of acclaimed fine-dining Korean restaurants in Seoul, such as Jungsik and Mingles, as well as Singapore’s very own one-Michelin-starred Meta, helmed by Korean chef Sun Kim, has slowly awakened foodies to the potential of this underrated cuisine.\n\n\nOne thing that might help to propel this up-and-coming cuisine towards more widespread recognition is if there is better access to quality ingredients outside the country – just like how gourmet Japanese or French produce are closely associated with fine food.\n“The Korean Peninsula is surrounded by sea and has an abundance of seafood. It also has fertile land. However the richness of Korean agricultural production — especially at the premium level – is not widely understood,” said chef, television host and food author Olivia Lee.\n\n\nThe Korean-born Lee, who is based in Singapore and married to Les Amis' executive chef Sebastien Lepinoy, first noticed how difficult it was to obtain quality Korean fruits when she was pregnant a few years ago.\n“I had a craving for my favourite fruit and was disappointed that what was available at local supermarkets tasted nothing like what I was familiar with. The strawberries were unripe and the peaches were hard and not sweet,” she said.\nThat was when she realised there was a gap in the market here for premium Korean produce.\n“The fruits I grew up eating were nearly always delicious with the perfect balance of sweetness and acidity that I knew would appeal to both chefs and consumers,” she said. To capture this business opportunity, she launched Brandfit, a consulting firm that exports and promotes Korean agricultural products, last December.\n\n\n So the Korean wave sweeping the world isn't just confined to BTS, K-pop, electronics or the ubiquitous Samsung phone. Korean food and in particular Korean produce is also getting major head space. Check out these Korean products from Culina in Dempsey. I just ate the melon yesterday and it was one of the sweetest I have had. It was so honey tinged I could hardly believe it wasn't artificially sweetned. As amazing a fruit was you're likely to find in Singapore folks. The muscat grapes are not just sweet and fragrant but check out the size and plumpness of those globes. The fruits were so tasty I went down to Culina this morning and bought some for the folks and in laws. I will cook the Golden Queen rice next week and use the various seasonings that came with the package. That Yuja tea is also rather tasty as a drink. Super refreshing. It reminds me of the more familiar yuzu. I can see the beginning of a trend to start cooking Korean at home! #premiumkoreanproduce #premiumkorea #koreanproducts #sejimuskmelon #sangjushinemuscat #yujatea #culinaatcomodempsey #comodempsey\nA post shared by  Loh Lik Peng (@pengloh) on Oct 17, 2020 at 11:59pm PDT\nShe is confident the ingredients will hold their own against other gourmet products. Lee said, “For example, while Italy and France are famous for their truffles, Korea has premium pine mushrooms or matsutake. They have a natural smoky flavour and a chewy texture which adds flavour and depth to any dish.”\nShe does extensive research, which includes personally visiting farmers and producers in Korea, to ensure the ingredients she exports meet her exacting standards. Her experiences have imparted her with many interesting encounters with the country’s most dedicated food suppliers.\n\n\n“Many of my agricultural partners work with knowledge they have inherited from their ancestors,” she added. “I work with an expert forager who has been digging pine mushrooms in the mountains for over 30 years while the Shine Muscat grape farmer only grows one to two bunches of grapes on each vine so that he gets the best grapes from each harvest.”\nThe fruits, produce and artisanal sauces such as the grapes, Ok-dom (amadai) fish and snow crab white soy sauce are available at Culina. The company also supplies ingredients to restaurants and has collaborated with various chefs, including Sun Kim of Meta and Julien Royer of three Michelin starred Odette to showcase the potential of the produce.\n“Having access to these top-quality ingredients allows us to experiment with the flavours which I am familiar with back in Korea and flavours which I hope to achieve. The Badasoop Gamtae seaweed brings me back to the seas of Korea,” said chef Kim, who is currently using some of Brandfit’s ingredients – the seaweed is one of the key ingredients in Meta’s Jeju abalone dish – in the restaurant’s tasting and lunch menus.\nLee’s other goal is to demonstrate that top-notch Korean produce is suited for more than just Korean cooking. “Premium produce in the hands of skilled chefs can be adapted to suit many cuisines,” she noted.\nTo showcase the versatility of the ingredients, Brandfit worked with chef Julien Royer to create an exclusive five-course tasting menu that incorporates Korean produce in fine dining European cuisine. Dishes included a Songi mushroom & Jeju abalone duo and a Shine Muscat grape and Yuja (Korean yuzu) gourmandise cheesecake.\n“While my cuisine is French in DNA, we’ve consistently infused a sense of place, carrying an utmost respect for seasonality, terroir and artisanal produce sourced from boutique producers around the region and the world. In this case, using artisanal Korean ingredients introduces distinctive textures and flavours to bring a sense of excitement,” said chef Royer, who is looking into using Korean ingredients in future menus. Highlights for him included the naturally smoky flavour of the Songi mushrooms that were reminiscent of a forest and the clean flavour of the pine nuts.\nThe coronavirus-induced travel restrictions have also led to a stronger demand for gourmet produce from different countries as Singaporeans continue trying to soothe feelings of wanderlust by splurging on their meals, whether at restaurants or at home.\nDylan Tan, who hosts live sales sessions for the 52,000-strong Facebook group Singapore Home Cooks (SHC), has noticed a surge in demand for fresh Japanese ingredients in recent months.\xa0\n“When we started selling air-flown Japanese products during circuit breaker, it immediately became a hit as many Singaporean residents who enjoy high-quality restaurant food could not have the same experience due to the restrictions,” he said.\nTheir “Japan nights”, he noted, feature highly sought-after fresh imports of Japanese uni, ikura, sashimi grade fishes, prized beef and pork and authentic desserts.\nIn September, the Okinawa International Logistics Hub partnered with SHC to launch rare seasonal produce from the country’s different prefectures. At its first Live session, its curated range of premium products from Kagoshima, including Annou Imo sweet potato caramels and amberjack carpaccio (a prized catch served in top Michelin-starred Tokyo restaurants), were mostly sold out within 90 minutes.\nLee’s Brandfit also reported an increase in sales by 20 per cent compared to figures from six months ago. “More people are cooking at home since the pandemic has hit. There is also more interest in fresh, immunity-boosting food and a growing demand for premium produce,” she said.\nFor ideas on how to enjoy these new ingredients at home, take a leaf from Lee’s book.\n“We tend to have light, healthy meals consisting of simple dishes that rely on the natural flavour of good ingredients so we grill, roast or blanch our vegetables and meat. My husband and my two-year-old daughter like rice, so I cook the best Golden Queen short grain rice from Korea,” she said.\n“And my daughter loves it when I freeze fresh grapes, melons and strawberries, which she eats like ice-cream.”\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Korea ', '     food ', '     Singapore ', '     gastronomy ', '     Restaurants ']}"

      Who are the Indian chefs shaking up Bangkok’s dining scene?
  </h1>, 'text': 'Understated is a personality trait rarely ascribed to Gaggan Anand – a man legendary both for his cooking skills and his flair for self-promotion. Bangkok’s most renowned Indian chef was projecting on Instagram again in late September: Posting an image of himself in a garish hooded anorak accompanied by the lyrics to Creep, Radiohead’s enduring paean to self-loathing.\nWhat the multi-Michelin-starred chef was trying to convey is unclear. Nevertheless, the post and the attention it received (over 5,000 likes and counting) reaffirmed his rock-star status.\n\n\n I don\'t care if it hurts I wanna have control I want a perfect body I want a perfect soul I want you to notice When I\'m not around You\'re so fuckin\' special I wish I was special But I\'m a creep I\'m a weirdo What the hell am I doing here? I don\'t belong here, oh, oh. #gaggan #gaggananand #hugmeismelllikecurry\nA post shared by  Gaggan ⚡️Anand ⚡️ (@gaggan_anand) on Sep 27, 2020 at 7:01am PDT\nWhile Anand is not averse to the limelight, his progress to the top of Bangkok\'s culinary tree has been far from self-serving. Indeed, his impact has helped clear a path for a succession of endlessly creative young Indian chefs.\nThailand’s capital has long had a strong Indian food game. Since ancient times there have been various exchanges between India and Thailand, and Indian communities have existed in the country since the middle of the 19th century.\nAs a result, it’s never been difficult to fill up on Indian cuisine in Bangkok. From ramshackle shophouses in Phahurat – Bangkok’s “Little India” – to opulent dining rooms straight from the set of a big Bollywood production, the city is not short on curry-laden tables.\nThings were relatively old-school until Anand came along. But when the Kolkata-born chef opened Gaggan in 2010, it was revolutionary in the most delicious sense.\nApplying molecular gastronomic techniques gleaned from his apprenticeship at El Bulli in Catalonia, he shook up Indian cooking and took it on a rip-roaring odyssey to another dimension: One where dishes are defined by emojis and flavours inspired by Portugal, Japan, Thailand, and the South American continent.\nA decade later, his influence remains strong. The chef\'s eponymous new venture, Gaggan Anand, continues to wow diners and critics alike. His trailblazing willingness to tinker with the tenets of his native country’s cuisine, meanwhile, has inspired other talents to follow in his footsteps and make Bangkok a hub in the region for progressive Indian dining. Here are three that deserve mention.\n\n\nDEEPANKER KHOSLA, HAOMA\nDeep in the labyrinthine network of streets that extend like tangled veins from Sukhumvit Road, Deepanker Khosla is taking a break from cooking to tend to his garden.\n“Everything we do here at Haoma is with sustainability in mind,” he said, plucking an edible flower from its stem before guiding me to a series of tanks filled with fish thrashing around in conserved rainwater.\nKhosla’s ecologically-minded ethos has earned him a reputation as one of Bangkok’s most conscientious chefs.\nThe garden at Haoma, which doubles up as an aquaponics farm, uses the conserved rainwater, which is enriched with enzymes from fish excretion to irrigate different varieties of plants, herbs, and edible flowers. Food waste, meanwhile, cycles nutrients back into the soil.\nKhosla’s firm anti-pesticide, no antibiotics policy, and local sourcing would be admirable on its own. But the chef’s dazzling cooking skills are as obvious as his commitment to the environment.\nRaised in Allahabad (now officially known as Prayagraj) in northern India, Khosla cooked his way around seven Indian cities as a chef in some of the subcontinent\'s grandest hotels. He arrived in Bangkok for a stint at the helm of Charcoal, one of the city\'s fanciest classic Indian restaurants, before pursuing his path with Haoma.\nAlthough the chef himself is a relative stripling at just 27, he is well versed in the lore of India’s ancient culinary heritage. As such, his menus feature dishes that delve into history – both his own and his country’s – while deploying a high-wire ultra-modern approach to presentation and technique.\n“Pondicherry” Pulissery, seafood curry with suggestions of bouillabaisse, harks back to when the French held sway over parts of southern India. His elevated take on humble dal, meanwhile, is a personal nostalgia trip he shares with the millions of people around India weaned on the familiar staple.\n“I grew up eating it every day,” he laughed. “It takes me back to the place and years that shaped me into being who I am today.”\n“Everything we do here at Haoma is with sustainability in mind.”\nGARIMA ARORA, GAA\nIt is indicative of our hyper-globalised world that a Mumbai-born chef of Punjabi-stock who achieved wider recognition in Thailand sharpened her culinary mission in Scandinavia.\n“I learned from every kitchen, but the one experience that changed me was working at Noma,” said Garima Arora, who, in 2018, became the first Indian woman to earn a Michelin star with her pioneering Bangkok venture Gaa.\n""It was incredibly inspiring to see all the creative ways of cooking to make up for the limited resources in Scandinavia. That experience made me reflect deeply on my culinary heritage and the incredible resources we have in India.”\nArora, who swiftly ditched a career in journalism to embark on her globetrotting journey as a chef, was poised to follow her stint at Rene Redzepi’s Copenhagen venue with a job working with Gaggan Anand at his original Bangkok restaurant.\nThat plan fell through and Arora was all set to head back to Mumbai to pursue her vision of utilising India’s vast culinary arsenal in imaginative new ways. Anand and three other investors stepped in and allowed Arora the opportunity to start her venture.\nThe chef has certainly capitalised on this act of faith. Although influences were detectable – a Nordic-style philosophy of produce-centric seasonality for instance – Arora\'s sense of playfulness and willingness to experiment with unexpected flavour combinations soon marked her out as an individual.\nDishes such as Strawberry, Caviar, and Hor Wor Oil (hor wor is an aromatic herb commonly found in the north of Thailand), where seemingly contrasting ingredients enjoy at least one common compound are an example of her impactful use of “negative food pairings”, which, she said, has a strong presence in India’s regional cuisines.\nIndeed, while Arora is proud to extol the virtues of age-old Indian cooking techniques, she delights in the fact that even Indian diners are surprised by her food.\n“A unique combination of flavours, textures, and techniques defines Gaa best,"" she continued. ""It is a discovery about the cuisines of India in every bite.”\nIn Bangkok, it’s easy to navigate India’s classic foodie traditions. From luxurious curries and succulent grilled meats typical of northern states to the dosas and vegetarian-friendly fare of the south, the Thai capital covers an array of familiar bases.\nNevertheless, glaring omissions in the city’s Indian culinary arsenal remain. And it was one of these gaps that celebrated chef Hari Nayak has attempted to fill with Jhol, an ode to India’s glorious coastal cuisine.\nWith around 7,516km of coastline, India’s ocean-facing regions offer a wildly diverse tableau of flavours. Centuries of trade and exchanges with foreign powers in Europe and the Gulf states have fed into the various culinary traditions found on the east and west flanks of the nation.\nAt Jhol, Nayak ties together these strands to create a unified whole that is unlike any other Indian menu in Bangkok. As such, a meal at his first-ever venture in Thailand pinballs diners around the coastal areas of the sub-continent.\nMemorable pitstops include Mangalore in southern Karnataka, ground zero for a tangy ghee roast chicken in Kundapur masala served with a crispy cone dosa. Other standouts include pork belly vindaloo from Goa and small bites such as mini appams topped with spicy young jackfruit and a purple potato crisp.\nFor Nayak, who has launched concepts in locations as diverse as Dubai and Tennessee and is currently based in New York, Thailand seemed like a natural fit for Indian coastal cuisine.\n“There are a lot of similarities in ingredients and flavours with regional coastal cooking from the Indian peninsula and Thai cuisine,” he said. The produce is similar. I love Bangkok and I\'ve been here many times for several successful guest chef events and pop-up dinners. That is where I got inspired to start an Indian concept that is unique and was missing from the Bangkok dining scene.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     Restaurants ', '     Chefs ', '     Bangkok ', '     Thailand ', '     food ', '     F&B ', '     gastronomy ']}"

      Malaysia's manufacturers and grocers replacing their stock ahead of Jan 1 iodised salt rule 
  </h1>, 'text': 'KUALA LUMPUR: With three months to meet the new iodised salt rule before the Jan 1 compliance deadline kicks in, small grocers and sundry retailers are replacing\xa0their non-iodised stock on the shelves with those that fulfil the requirement of the Ministry of Health.\xa0\nThe ministry had on Sep 25 announced that iodine must be added to all fine salt or salt weighing 20kg and below, after a finding showed that 48.2 per cent of primary school children between eight and 10 years old suffered\xa0from iodine deficiency.\xa0\nIn addition,\xa02.1 per cent of children suffered from goiter, said\xa0Health Ministry director-general Noor Hisham Abdullah, while surveys involving pregnant women and school students revealed sub-optimal iodine intake.\xa0\nThe\xa0deadline, which was originally\xa0Sep 30, has now been postponed to New Year\'s Day following the grocers\'\xa0pleas for more time to comply with the new rule.\xa0\nIn\xa0general, seafood and seaweed contain\xa0iodine, as do enriched\xa0bread and dairy products from cheese to milk and yoghurt.\xa0\nA salt manufacturer told CNA that the requirement is easy to meet, as the iodisation process\xa0can be\xa0done at local factories. Importers can also simply bring in shipments consisting of iodised stock, he added.\xa0\nMr Seow Jun Ze, a partner and business development manager of\xa0salt manufacturer Qingli Snd Bhd, said his factory can run several tonnes of salt through its manufacturing setup, assembly line style.\n“The process is tightly controlled as Malaysia’s requirements for iodised salt is between 20 to 40 parts per million (PPM), meaning that for every kilogram of salt, we fortify it with 20 to 40 milligrams of sodium iodide solution, and make sure the solution is spread evenly,” he explained.\nHe added that in East Malaysia, iodised salt is the norm, as it had been gazetted for sale in both Borneo states for more than a decade.\nSalt is a controlled, fast-moving consumer good (FMCG), but it has no price controls, because of its\xa0very low price, he said.\nEach year, Mr Seow\'s company imports\xa0about 100,000 tonnes of salt from Australia.\xa0\n“Actually, the packaging and the logistics cost of the salt cost more than the actual item itself,” he noted. \xa0\nA tonne of raw Australian salt costs about US$50 to purchase from the producer, Mr Seow explained, although the logistics cost of bringing the raw salt over to Malaysia would also have to be factored in.\xa0\nAs for iodine, a kilogram of it,\xa0usually in the form of potassium or sodium iodide would\xa0cost about RM150 (US$36.10) at international prices.\n""There is a small extra\xa0cost to iodising the salt for consumers, but if you calculate the amount of salt you use spread out over a few months of your supply, it\'s barely noticeable for most consumers,"" he pointed out.\nWhen the initial announcement was made just five days before the\xa0Sep 30 compliance deadline, Mr Seow told CNA that some of his direct clients and those down the supply chain had actually recalled and replaced their stocks with iodised salt virtually overnight.\n“They basically incurred extra costs trying to comply with the original deadline, and now it’s pushed back,” he noted.\nGRACE PERIOD A RELIEF FOR RETAILERS\nFor Mr Hong Chee Meng, the president of the Federation of Sundry Goods Merchants Associations of Malaysia, the grace period of three months allows more time for small retailers\xa0to bring in more iodised stock.\nMr Hong opined that\xa0much more needs to be done on educating Malaysians on the reasons for using iodised salt, like how the Ministry of Health has been educating people\xa0about sugar and its dangers.\n“And actually, enforcement also needs to go up the chain to the manufacturers’ side too, not just on retailers,” he said.\nA hypermarket chain CNA spoke to concurred that the three-month period is more than enough to comply with the new rule.\xa0\n“Salt is a fast-moving good, and for our chain, we don’t stock a lot, at most about two weeks’ inventory. So for distributors and most mid-sized retailers, three months are more than enough,” Ms Carol Lim, the purchasing director for Checkers Hypermarket, said.\xa0\nThe chain services\xa0both retail consumers and other smaller retail stores down the supply line.\nWhile all sea salt naturally contains some iodine content, these might not meet the necessary dietary limits set by the government, Ms Lim said.\nREQUEST TO CONTINUE SELLING ORDINARY SALT\nDespite the government’s requirement that all salt sold to consumers be iodised, Ms Lim said there was still demand for uniodised salt.\nFor instance,\xa0thyroid cancer patients need to stay off iodine before and after undergoing radioactive iodine therapy.\xa0\nThere are also question marks\xa0over how retailers and importers of artisanal or specialty salts such as the pink Himalayan rock salt might fare after Jan 1.\n“They might be worse off because they have no manufacturing recourse to iodise the salt.\xa0If they are not able to iodise it, they might not be able to clear their stock (in time), as trade is unpredictable,” Ms Lim explained.\nAs for the hypermarket\xa0chain, Ms Lim said the company would monitor the situation first, although all uniodised stock should be cleared by then.\xa0\nMr Hong, the president of the sundry goods merchants federation, said his\xa0association have brought up\xa0members\' request to continue selling both types of salt after Jan 1 in\xa0a meeting with the Ministry of\xa0Health and Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs.\xa0\n""But there\'s no official word as yet,"" he said.\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     Malaysia ', '     food ']}"

      The Cameron Highlands farmers supplying ethical, organic produce to Singapore
  </h1>, 'text': ""Founded during the colonial era for British expats eager for a respite from the equatorial humidity, Cameron Highlands was Malaya’s largest hill station. While the colonialists played golf and tucked into scones, locals and savvy British entrepreneurs grew crops that thrived in the mild climate, like tea and strawberries. The latter has become so synonymous with this destination that strawberry picking is still a popular tourist attraction.\nApart from strawberries, vegetables and flowers are widely grown here, many of which are sent daily to Singapore. According to the Singapore Food Agency, Malaysia is Singapore’s top source of vegetables,\xa0supplying 69 per cent of the city’s leafy greens.\xa0\nDespite this, the reliance on imported produce is high, especially in fine-dining restaurants and 5-star hotels, which typically fly in produce from Europe and Australia, even though theoretically this produce could be grown in a location like Cameron Highlands.\nIt took Leisa Tyler, an erstwhile travel and food journalist, and her husband Ewout Kemner, a physicist, to connect the dots and start Weeds &More. This Cameron Highlands-based farm collective is dedicated to ethically-grown premium European produce.\nThe impetus came to Tyler while she was working in Singapore for the launch of Asia's 50 Best Restaurants in 2010. Back then, she encountered what she describes as “Fedex” chefs for the sheer amount of produce the chefs were flying in – expensive ingredients that had traversed multiple continents, created a humongous carbon footprint and at the sacrifice of freshness.\n\n\nA year later, galvanised by a bet with a restaurateur friend who said farmers in Malaysia could never grow baby d'Avignon radishes, Kemner and Tyler rolled up their sleeves and decided to try their luck in Cameron Highlands. Their efforts were supported by farmers in France, as well as by Singaporean restauranteur/hotelier Loh Lik Peng.\nEighteen months of research and development ensued to determine what would grow and the most efficient way to pack and ship the produce. The decision to grow mainly heirloom varieties of vegetables came about for several reasons.\n“Heirloom seeds are more sustainable as they promote biodiversity and are also better suited to a changing climate – drought- and flood-resistance is built into their DNA. They are also more flavourful and look prettier,” explains Tyler.\nApart of growing more unusual produce, the other requirement of this enterprise was to grow ethically. Not only does this subscribe to the couple’s principles, there was a demand for them from Malaysia’s and Singapore’s top restaurants.\nHowever, trying to convince farmers to grow heirloom produce – ethically, to boot – was challenging, to put it mildly.\n“We contacted three organic farmers. One wouldn't let us visit his farm and another thought we were stark raving mad. The third, Fung Chee Siang, who runs Hatiku Eco Farm, was intrigued, but it took six visits over six months and endless discussions about food and carbon miles and environmentalism for him to even agree to plant some trial seed,” recalled Tyler.\n“Malaysian farmers are in the right spot at the right time to tap into the region's growing interest in organic and heirloom produce and the carbon miles of food.” – Leisa Tyler\n\n\nORGANIC GROWTH\nFast forward to 2020, and Weeds & More currently works with four farmers. Fung’s Hatiku now has an organic certification from myOrganic, the Malaysian government's strict certification process.\nHaving lived in Canada for some time and with over 20 years of experience, Fung is well versed in sustainability. Tyler fondly describes Fung as being a valuable repository of knowledge and their moral compass to growing ethically.\nSunrise Organic Farm, run by the Liew family, who are old friends of Fung, was the second farm that came onboard. Originally hydroponic farmers, farming had become financially unsustainable for the Liews. Sunrise’s transition to organic farming was smooth (they are currently undergoing a three-year audit by myOrganic), and what was once just a small patch dedicated to organic produce now encompasses the entire 20,000 sqm (2-hectare) property.\nNatural Green Life Farm, run by Damon and Jake Wong, came next. The farm is currently in its third-year audit by a Taiwanese organic certifier, and first-year audit by myOrganic.\nIntroduced through a Kuala Lumpur organic supplier, Tyler and Damon bonded over a shared interest in growing “odd”-looking vegetables. The farm is located in the hills behind Brinchang at 1,600m above sea level, which happily lends itself to growing unusual brassicas like Romanesco.\nLast but not least are the Tungs of Cameronia Fresh, who were traditionally cut-flower farmers but joined Weeds & More after they were disillusioned by the ill effects of conventional high-spray farming. The Tungs’ farmland is still classified as being under conversion from chemicals, and as such is unable to be certified yet.\nThis, however, did not stop them from growing glorious heirloom tomatoes and beets. In fact, the Tungs are busy converting one of their farms to grow just that for Singapore grocer Bootle's.\n\n\nWHERE TO SAMPLE THE PRODUCE\nThese days, Weeds & More supplies herbs, vegetables, edible flowers and garnish leaves for Singapore and Malaysia’s top hotels such as Kuala Lumpur’s W Hotel, Andaz Singapore, as well as fine-dining restaurants known for their produce-led approach like Kuala Lumpur’s DC and Entier, and Singapore’s Nouri.\nIn fact, chef Ivan Brehm of Nouri cited his relationship with Weeds & More as instrumental in the growth of the restaurant because of the access it gave them to fresh, high-quality, organic ingredients.\nHow Weeds & More achieve this is by harvesting very early in the morning so that the produce is packed and ready to go by mid-afternoon, and then driven to Singapore or Kuala Lumpur overnight. “Essentially chefs receive the produce the day after they’re harvested. While a big shipment day is pretty hectic, ensuring quality and freshness is more important than beauty sleep,” laughed Tyler.\nProfitability from farming on a small scale can be tricky, but Weeds & More overcomes this by growing mostly to order. By supplying direct to customers, “prices are fixed for both farmers and customers throughout the year and the farmer can plan and budget and earn a stable income,” explained Tyler.\nMoreover, while sustainable farming for ethical reasons lies at the heart of the Weeds & More ethos, its economic returns are far greater than the alternative.\nAccording to Tyler, “The emphasis on quality over quantity is a concept many Malaysian farmers cannot get their heads around. Large-scale agriculture is the norm, but many of these farmers cannot compete against those in Vietnam and China. So what comes next?” she asked.\n“Specialty, healthy, high-value produce. Malaysian farmers are in the right spot at the right time to tap into the region's growing interest in organic and heirloom produce and the carbon miles of food.”\nWeeds & More have proven that it can be done well and profitably. It would do the Cameron Highlands a world of good if their business model catches on with other farmers in the area.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     food ', '     Singapore ', '     Malaysia ', '     Cameron Highlands ', '     sustainability ']}"

      A dash of honey: Jakarta's 'burnt' banana fritters a sought-after comfort food
  </h1>, 'text': 'JAKARTA: “Madam, what is that? It is a burnt banana fritter, please don’t serve it to people.\n“We don’t like it.”\nSuch was the feedback Nanik Soelistiowati received back in 2007 when she first introduced her round, seemingly charred\xa0banana fritters to hotels in Jakarta, where she was serving catering food.\nFast forward 10 years later, her\xa0banana fritters known locally as Pisang Goreng Madu Bu Nanik (Mdm\xa0Nanik’s Honey Banana Fritters) is\xa0the bestselling product on Indonesian food delivery platform GoFood. \xa0\nToday, as the COVID-19 pandemic rages on, the honey fried banana remains widely sought-after and is still among GoFood\'s most popular products.\n“When I look back, I sometimes shed tears,” Mdm Soelistiowati told CNA.\nMdm Soelistiowati has always loved cooking and she started to establish a food catering service for hotels in Jakarta when her two children were small.\nHer honey fried banana was initially part of her catering menu, but when demand for the fritters grew, Mdm Soelistiowati decided to leave the catering industry and focused on building her honey fried banana brand.\nMany\xa0customers say her banana fritters are\xa0crispy and the honey melts in the mouth.\xa0\xa0\nThere are usually long lines of queues at her one and only outlet in West Jakarta.\xa0Sometimes people even have to wait for hours to get hold of the fritters.\xa0\n\n\nSold at about 6,800 rupiah (US$0.46) per piece, Mdm Soelistiowati\'s\xa0fritters\xa0are affordable but cannot be easily reproduced, she claimed.\xa0\n”Perhaps a lot of people now make honey banana fritters, but theirs are not the same as mine. Because we care about the taste, and\xa0I always put quality first,” she said.\nTo make her fritters, Mdm Soelistiowati mixes bananas with honey, flour and salt.\nShe uses honey instead of sugar because her mother had diabetes and Mdm Soelistiowati wanted\xa0her to enjoy the\xa0snack.\nThe\xa0secret behind the\xa0successful fritters is that the bananas must be ripe enough but not too ripe, she added.\xa0\nMdm Soelistiowati said if she does not have the right bananas, she would rather close\xa0her outlet\xa0– which has happened before\xa0 – than selling fritters which do\xa0not taste good.\nA TENACIOUS ENTREPRENEUR\nApart from the quality of the\xa0bananas, the other secret to Mdm Soelistiowati’s success is\xa0her tenacity.\n“I want to work hard, and I was tenacious,” the 65-year-old said.\n“When I was still catering food, I only slept two, three hours a day. Initially, I worked on everything. I delivered it myself, I looked after the food (at the hotel) myself.\xa0Once done then I had to cook again.” \xa0\n“I went shopping at the fish market myself, I woke up at 3am in the morning to shop for vegetables … I once fell into a drain at the fish market in the middle of the night. I did everything and I did not grumble\xa0because I like cooking,” she revealed.\nEven when the hotels complained\xa0about the appearance of her fritters, she was not discouraged.\nShe explained that the fritters were not burnt; it was the honey that made them look black.\xa0\n\n\nPeople started to enjoy the snack and soon she received requests to sell the fitters at bazaars.\n“When we first started, it was not easy,” Mdm Soelistiowati said.\xa0\nThe big breakthrough came when Mdm Soelistiowati’s two children, who work on the production and marketing of the product, decided in 2014 to put the product\xa0on GoFood, the new food delivery service owned by ride-hailing app Gojek.\nDELIVERY PLATFORMS HELPED BUSINESS GROW\nPisang Goreng Madu Bu Nanik\xa0was one of the first merchants on GoFood and its product\xa0became a big hit.\nWhen rival Grab entered Indonesia a few years later, they approached Mdm Soelistiowati to be a merchant on the app and Pisang Goreng Madu Bu Nanik became even more popular.\nGrab even wanted the product to be on their food delivery services in other countries such as Vietnam, but Mdm Soelistiowati declined for the time being as she is afraid that she cannot ensure the quality of the snack.\nLater, delivery service Paxel also wanted to offer Pisang Goreng Madu Bu Nanik on its platform.\nWith Paxel,\xa0the delicacy can now be shipped all over\xa0Java island and Bali on a same-day delivery service.\nThe banana fritters have also attracted many individual resellers, who buy from\xa0Mdm Soelistiowati\xa0in Jakarta and then sell them in other Indonesian cities and even abroad such as Hong Kong.\xa0\n\n\nBack in April,\xa0Mdm Soelistiowati\xa0decided to close her outlet to protect her employees as well as customers from COVID-19.\xa0\nShe continued to pay her 50 employees and told her children: ""We are not just looking for profit.

      Antibiotics in chicken a cause for concern? And five other questions about poultry today
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Earlier this year, Benjamin Ang started rearing his own chickens at a community space on Henderson Road; he wanted fresh eggs and premium chickens bred in what he feels are humane conditions.\nValued for their superior meat, the French chickens he rears — poulet de Bresse — are among the world’s most expensive chickens.\nA frozen Bresse costs between S$50 and S$70 each, compared with about S$4 for a regular frozen grill chicken that one can find at a supermarket.\n“(Bresse) chicken has been described as the queen of poultry and the poultry for kings. They’ve been bred specifically for their flavour and texture of the meat,” said Ang.\n“If you’re looking at the quality of the meat or the experience of something different, then I’d say it’s definitely worthwhile.”\nBresse chickens command premium prices as they require more personal space, and a third of their diet consists of naturally foraged earthworms, insects and grass.\nThese days, chickens come with many labels, such as corn-fed, free-range and organic, with each variety promising to be environmentally friendlier, healthier and tastier than your average chicken.\nBut all these labels may lead you to wonder what “antibiotic-free” or “probiotics-fed” really means. And how do these varieties affect the meat’s nutritional value? The programme Talking Point finds out six things you should know when buying chicken.\n1. WHAT DO THE LABELS MEAN?\n100 per cent organic: To be certified, these poultry must be reared with no antibiotics, provided with 100 per cent organic feed and given access to the outdoors.\nFor example, Ryan’s Grocery co-founder Wendy Foo said the organic chickens it sells are from Australia, and when they are sick, essential oils are administered to them, instead of antibiotics.\nAntibiotic residue-free: Antibiotics have been administered to these chickens but are removed from their feed a few days before they are slaughtered, so that there is no residue left in the meat when it is processed.\nProbiotics-fed: Instead of antibiotic growth promoters, said Kee Song Food Corporation (Singapore) head of business development James Sim, these chickens are fed with probiotics.\nIn the case of the company’s flagship product, Lacto Chicken, they are fed on lactobacillus to enhance their immune system.\nWATCH: Is it safe to eat chicken reared with antibiotics? (2:31)\nFree-range: The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) generally permits this term to be used if the chickens have access to the outdoors for at least some part of the day.\nThe USDA has no provision, however, for the duration spent outside or the amount of space provided.\nAs for kampung chickens, they are a breed of chickens, Foo points out. Originally free-range, they are now highly likely to be farmed in cages.\nFactory-farmed: Although not labelled as such, these are the most common chickens sold in supermarkets. Known as broilers, they are bred for meat production.\nKept in cages where the living conditions are typically “not as hygienic”, they are fed with antibiotics “so that they stay healthy”, said Foo.\n2. WILL THE ANTIBIOTICS HARM ME?\nAntibiotics are used globally by the livestock industry to prevent and treat infectious bacterial diseases, the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) said on its website.\nNonetheless, poultry treated with antibiotics “may not be processed for food until a specified withdrawal period has been observed to allow antibiotic residues to be sufficiently cleared from the system”.\nThe SFA prescribes maximum residue levels (MRLs) “so that we know the chicken we buy is safe for consumption”, said William Chen, the director of Nanyang Technological University’s food science and technology programme.\nThere is a strict inspection scheme to ensure that drug residues do not exceed those levels, the professor added.\nJust last month, the SFA suspended the import of live chickens from a farm in Malaysia after detecting drug residues exceeding MRLs in samples collected from a consignment of the farm’s chickens.\nAll imported and local food products are subject to regular inspections and sampling, including for harmful bacteria.\nThe chances of antibiotic-resistant bacteria going into chicken flesh are also “very low”, as these bacteria are typically found in the bird’s digestive system, said Chen.\n“When we properly cook the chicken, all the bacteria — whether they’re antibiotic-resistant or not — will be killed off. So consumers shouldn’t be overly worried about eating chicken bought from the supermarket or wet market.”\n3. HOW DOES THE CHICKEN’S DIET AFFECT ITS MEAT?\nThe texture of the meat depends on the feed, said Foo. For example, meat from chickens fed with bromelain, a digestive enzyme extracted from pineapples, is leaner and firmer as well as lower in fat and cholesterol, she cited.\nWhat an animal eats has an effect on its fat. “That’s where you’re getting a lot of flavour from,” Annie King, from the Department of Animal Science at the University of California, Davis, told the magazine Popular Science.\nBut not all flavours the animal eats will be carried over into the meat, as some compounds will be metabolised before they make it to the fat, the magazine reported.\n4. DOES THE FEED AFFECT THE NUTRITIONAL VALUE?\nRegardless of what the chickens eat, the formulation of the feed is such that it provides certain amounts of nutrition.\nFarmers would calculate the proportions of raw materials to provide, say, the energy levels the chickens “require for their functional maintenance”, said poultry health expert Lynn Tan.\nSome chickens are fed with grains such as brown rice or quinoa, as these ingredients’ “purported health benefits” are well known to consumers.\n“This could trigger a positive psychological effect in the consumer,” said the veterinary practitioner. “But in actual fact, it doesn’t increase the fibre content of chicken meat … It’s just a marketing aspect of chicken meat.”\nShe added that she “wouldn’t pay that much more” for chickens fed on brown rice, corn and soya, because “ultimately, the nutritional formulation will be the same as a typical commercially-fed chicken”.\n5. WHY ARE PREMIUM CHICKENS SO COSTLY?\nA bromelain-fed chicken costs about S$19 per kilogramme, while a cage-free corn-fed and soya-fed chicken costs about S$23/kg. A 100 per cent free-roaming, organic chicken costs S$42/kg.\nThey cost a premium because antibiotic growth promoters are usually not administered to them, so they take longer to reach the ideal size for slaughter.\nFor example, it takes at least 56 days for a free-range chicken and 81 days for an organic one, compared to 40-odd days for a broiler chicken.\nThen there is the amount of space given. Organic chickens get the most space, at about 10 chickens per square metre; free-range chickens at about 12 chickens per sq m; and conventional broilers at about 17 chickens per sq m.\nWATCH: The full episode — is free-range chicken better for you? (21:59)\nSome premium chickens are also fed with slightly more premium feeds, like corn, soya, organic feed, brown rice and probiotics.\n6. WHAT IS THE FUTURE OF POULTRY FARMING?\nThere is a growing number of poultry farmers in Singapore, Malaysia and other Southeast Asian countries who are switching to farming without the use of antibiotic growth promoters, and on a larger scale, said Sim.\nThis is to give consumers a healthier choice “in terms of good-quality protein”.\nHis chickens even roam in barns with piped music, namely classical music.\n“It’s a way to promote a calmer and … less stressful environment. If they don’t feel so much stress, they grow up healthier and their meat is a bit tenderer,” he said.\nWatch this episode of Talking Point here.

      For two nights only, Sri Lankan cuisine meets Singapore heritage food
  </h1>, 'text': 'Perhaps it is a collective need to connect with one another or imbue our lives with a sense of exploration and discovery, but one of the upsides of COVID-19 invading our lives has been the collaborations between chefs across the island. The latest of these is one of the most exciting yet: A four-hands dinner happening on Oct 22 and Oct 23 between Eurasian-Peranakan chef Damian D’Silva and Sri Lanka-born Australian chef Rishi Naleendra.\nD’Silva, who is widely regarded as the keeper of Singapore’s heritage recipes, heads Kin at private club Straits Clan. Naleendra heads modern-European fine diner Cloudstreet and the highly anticipated Sri Lankan restaurant Kotuwa, which is set to open early next year.\nThe dinner is the first in a series of collaborations that D’Silva is planning called The Heritage Table and it explores Naleendra’s Sri Lankan heritage and cuisine which centres around togetherness and community.\n“The Heritage Table is an opportunity for us to explore cultural foods beyond what we do at Kin, especially ones that are lesser-known or underrepresented,” said D’Silva. “I am always interested in exploring more overlooked and under-appreciated cuisines. I believe there’s plenty we can bring to the table to share with our wider community.”\n“The Heritage Table is an opportunity for us to explore cultural foods beyond what we do at Kin, especially ones that are lesser-known or underrepresented.” – Damian D’Silva\nFORGING BONDS THROUGH FOOD\nThe only requisite for these collaborations is good chemistry and connection between D’Silva and the partnering chefs. “If I can’t connect with the other chef, then how can we create synergy in our food, right?” he added.\nTo that end, the connection between Naleendra and him was so immediate that everything clicked at the very first tasting menu. “We didn’t even need to do a second tasting or work on any other dishes. Everything just went so well together,” D’Silva said with satisfaction.\nOn the menu are dishes like Naleendra’s Sri Lankan crab curry, lychee achcahru (a spicy pickle), dallo baduma (fried battered calamari tossed in tongue-tingling chilli butter), and jackfruit curry. To that, D’Silva will add dry-fried moringa leaves, fish biryani, tomato and date chutney, a pennywort salad, and dried prawn peratal, which he describes as a take on the classic Eurasian prawn bostador.\xa0 \xa0\nWorking on this menu hasn’t meant doing separate work in their respective kitchens or one kitchen leading the charge. Rather, D’Silva has designed the process so that it involves staff from both kitchens working together. “The reason for that is when we share exchanges and ideas, then we come out richer for the experience. I want my team to be exposed to other cuisines and to learn about the challenges that other kitchens may face.”\nThe collateral reward is the splendid food that diners get to enjoy, even if just across two fleeting nights.\nThe Heritage Table featuring Kotuwa will be held at Kin on Oct 22 and Oct 23\n', 'related_topics': ['     Singapore ', '     food ', '     F&B ', '     gastronomy ', '     Restaurants ', '     Fine dining ', '     Chefs ']}"

      We sampled SIA’s new home delivery menu. Here’s what we thought
  </h1>, 'text': 'Say you are one of those frequent fliers on Singapore Airlines (SIA) who misses everything about those flights that used to punctuate your adventures in and out of Singapore. Say you miss the friendly\xa0cabin crew who know you by name and how much champagne you like to drink. Say you miss the famous SIA satay and those comfy Lalique pyjamas that you would have slipped into before going to sleep. And say you’re such a diehard SIA fan that you even miss the inflight videos featuring perfectly coiffed cabin crew telling you what to do in case of an emergency.\nFor all that and more, there is now SIA@Home, which as its name suggests, allows you to create that unique SIA experience in the comfort of your abode, complete with fine Wedgwood and Narumi china if you so desire. And no, there is no melamine tableware on offer because… well, no one ever said they miss eating economy class meals.\n\n\nMILES FOR SMILES\nWith prices starting from S$288 or 36,000 Krisflyer miles, customers can purchase a menu for two designed by the likes of three-Michelin-star French chef Georges Blanc, with your choice of a bottle of French Champagne or wine, and two newly designed SIA Business Class Penhaligon amenity kits.\nIf you have more cash or miles to spare, there are First Class packages starting from S$448 or 56,000 miles, which will get you a meal for two designed by feted Australian chef Matt Moran or Indian celebrity chef Sanjeev Kapoor, preceded by that fabulous satay and caviar service, and your\xa0choice of a bottle of red or white wine.\nExquisite Japanese meals dreamed up by three-Michelin-starred chef Yoshihiro Murata of the famed Kikunoi in Japan cost a little more, starting from S$318 or 39,750 miles.\nJUST YOUR HEAD IN THE CLOUDS\n“To clarify,” said Betty Wong, SIA’s divisional vice president of inflight services and design, at a media presentation on Oct 5, “this is not a home delivery service. SIA@Home is about recreating the holistic SIA experience at home. It is the food, wine and signatures of SIA, like the signature satay, caviar service and garlic bread. We have even curated these menus based on the season. So if you were flying to Paris at this time of year, this is what you would have been served (on the plane).”\nWhile your food is not sent to you by a kebaya-clad cabin crew member (but by a regular ol’ delivery driver), specially trained cabin crew-turned-concierges will call you upon receiving your online order to note your choice of dishes and wine. There are QR codes and URLs that lead to videos which demonstrate how your food should be plated and messages from SIA’s wine specialists waxing lyrical about the accompanying libations.\nAnd should you really, really miss being on the plane, there are cabin tour videos of all the different aircrafts under SIA’s stable.\nThe food, we are happy to report after sitting down to it at the presentation, is on par with many good restaurants. Naturally, much thought has gone into ensuring that the dishes stand up well to reheating, just like they would be done in a pressurised\xa0cabin 30,000 feet above ground. Except on terra firma, your taste buds are uncompromised and there is no post-meal cabin pressure bloat.\n\n\nGOODWILL AND A STEAL\nBut why would anyone want to replicate an airplane meal (no matter how memorable) on land, you ask? For one, support. SIA has given plenty for Singapore to be proud of. In good times, we fete the undeniable fact that it is indeed a great way to fly. We love our impeccably styled Singapore girls, the spotless flight records of SIA’s pilots, and those beautifully produced safety videos that people actually stop to watch before the planes take off.\nIn these dire times for aviation, many of us feel it only right to give back to an entity that has given us numerous bragging rights over the years, especially if we’ve afforded more than a few business class seats per annum. If that sense of altruism buys just a bit of high-class kitsch in the comforts of home, then why not? God forbid we should one day make it out of our closed borders without a national airline to boast of.\nAnd then there’s the tableware. For a supplement of about S$100, you can buy a 22-piece dinner set from Wedgwood or Narumi and six Lalique crystal champagne and wine glasses along with your meal. For comparison’s sake, anyone who’s ever window-shopped at Wedgwood knows that S$100 would typically buy you three-quarters of a similarly designed dinner plate.\xa0 \xa0\nThis might explain why 72 percent of the 57 orders that SIA received in the 15 hours since its launch at midnight on Oct 5 comprised food and wine sets with tableware. Singaporeans, grounded or not, can sure spot a bargain when they see one.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Singapore ', '     Singapore Airlines ', '     SIA ', '     food ', '     F&B ', '     Travel ', '     gastronomy ', '     Fine dining ']}"

      Lim Chu Kang to be transformed into high-tech agri-food cluster under SFA master plan
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The Lim Chu Kang area is set to be transformed into a high-tech agri-food cluster, in a move that will strengthen Singapore’s food security and also create jobs for Singaporeans.\nThe Singapore Food Agency (SFA) announced the master plan exercise on Friday (Oct 2), saying that the redeveloped Lim Chu Kang agri-food cluster should be able to produce more than three times its current food production when completed.\nThe agency plans to look into the development of shared facilities to lower production costs and resource use, as well as put in place the water, electricity and transport infrastructure needed to support high-tech farming systems on the 390 ha land.\nThis will also attract a “new generation” of agri-tech skilled workers, said SFA, adding that these initiatives are in response to feedback from the industry.\nWhile agri-food production will be the key focus of the master plan exercise, “relevant elements” such as farmers’ markets and education tours will also be considered, said SFA.\n“While we will continue to identify alternative spaces to produce food, such as the rooftops of HDB multi-storey car parks, we will need to optimise and intensify our agriculture land to grow more with less,” said SFA in a media release.\n“The redevelopment of agriculture land in Lim Chu Kang allows us to uplift the local agri-food sector, and develop sustainable, highly productive and industry-leading farms of the future,” it added.\n\n\nUnder the’30 by 30’ target, the Government aims to produce 30 per cent of Singapore’s nutritional needs by 2030. This is up from less than 10 per cent today, said SFA.\n“We currently import more than 90 per cent of our food supply, which makes us vulnerable to disruptions in global supply chains. The ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic has underscored the importance of ensuring that we have diversified sources and resilient food supply chains,” said SFA.\nThe master plan, undertaken in consultation with stakeholders, is expected to be completed over the next two to three years.\nMeanwhile, development works, which will be carried out in phases, are slated to start in 2024.\nMORE THAN THREE TIMES ITS CURRENT FOOD PRODUCTION\nThe redeveloped Lim Chu Kang should be able to produce more than three times its current food production, said SFA on Friday.\nWhile an average vegetable farm in Singapore produces about 130 tonnes of vegetables per hectare per year on 2ha of land, a high-tech, high-productivity version will be able to produce more than 1,000 tonnes per hectare per year on less than 1 ha of land, SFA said.\n“This will contribute substantially to the ’30 by 30’ goal, and efforts to ensure food security for Singaporeans,” it said.\nAll farms in the Lim Chu Kang area will be able to stay to the end of their leases.\nTwenty-three farms, whose leases are expiring between 2020 and 2022, will be offered a short tenancy extension before SFA redevelops the land. Three farms whose leases expire between 2026 and 2027 will be allowed to remain there until their leases expire.\nSFA and the National Parks Board (NParks) will work closely with these farms to support their transition.\nThe master plan does not encroach on the Sungei Buloh Nature Park Network, said SFA, adding that it will conduct an environmental study by the end of this year to “better understand the ecosystem of flora and fauna in the area”.\nIt will work with nature groups on the study, and the findings will be taken into consideration in the master plan, it said.\n', 'related_topics': ['     food ', '     agriculture ', '     SFA ']}"

In the past few months, he’s not only steered his acclaimed restaurant Cure through the Circuit Breaker, serving the comfort fare of his native Ireland to diners at home, he’s also launched Ember Beach Club at One & Only Desaru Coast last month.\nAnd on this first day of October, his latest concept, Catfish, opens its doors to the public. Described as a “contemporary fish grill and raw bar”, Catfish sits along Gemmill Lane, taking over the space vacated by Club Street Social.\n“Catfish is really my vision of a seafood restaurant that is lacking in the market at the moment,” said Walsh.\n“There are lots of good oyster bars, but I wanted to do something more modern in terms of presentation and technique, but still not fine-dining. It’s a casual hangout. It’s vibe-y, it’s fun, it’s contemporary. It’s great for lunch with lush greenery during the day, and at night, when the lights are dimmed, it’s a really intimate place that you can come to with your friends and family to eat fish and feast.”\nLike Butcher Boy, Walsh’s meat-centric Asian fusion bar and grill, Catfish will serve food for sharing, with bright Asian inflections in its flavours. His vision will be channelled through Catfish’s head chef Erik Gustafsson, whose resume boasts stints at F12 in Stockholm and, most recently, a tenure as R&D executive chef at Hidden Door Concepts.\nThe lounge-y restaurant, tricked out in tropical urban style – think jade tiled floors and sleek dark wood accents – will feature highlights such as hasselback potatoes topped with bluefin tuna and wasabi, and a catfish taco with umeboshi and hazelnuts. The latter comprises a taco shell made of crispy wanton skin filled with Japanese catfish sashimi, plum jam and an umeboshi (pickled plum) mayo.\nIts raw bar features more Asian-style treats such as hamachi or kingfish sashimi with ponzu and nashi pear, while larger groups can tuck into heartier options such as a whole Sichuan barbecued fish with crispy herbs and lobster laksa sauce.\nPrices for the a la carte menu start from S$16 for the catfish taco and go up to S$58 for a decadent sesame prawn toast with uni and caviar. Additionally, there are appealingly priced bento lunch boxes and weekend brunches themed “fish feasts”.\nNaturally, there are drinks too – wines, beers like Suntory on tap, and cocktails with prices starting from S$24. Bar manager Michael Matthew De Costa also draws from the Asian canon to yield concoctions such as Lantern Fest, featuring a mix of Paper Lantern Gin with Sichuan syrup, orange butter and cardamom.\nCatfish\xa0is open\xa0from Tuesdays to Sundays; for reservations, call +65 9069 9207 or click here\n', 'related_topics': ['     Singapore ', '     food ', '     F&B ', '     Restaurants ', '     gastronomy ', '     Fine dining ', '     Chefs ']}"

  </h1>, 'text': 'BANGKOK: Just two metro stops from Sukhumvit’s skyline of gleaming bustling malls lies a slum with a reputation for violence – a neighbourhood few visitors to Bangkok know about or dare venture into.\nAnd in this slum, the city’s oldest and largest, are mouth-watering and cheap delicacies like live shrimp salad and an Isaan dish of bile and pig’s blood only for the brave.\n“This is the Klong Toey slum. This area is known for drug sellers and other illicit activities,” said resident and street hawker Pranee Wiangnon, who’s known as Big Mama there.\nIf someone gives you trouble, just tell me. I’m not scared of the people here... No one will dare mess with me.\nFellow resident Sirathorn recounts how, when she moved in 30 years ago, drug addicts were always asking for money. “It took me a long time to decide\xa0whether we could settle down here for good.”\nThis documentary series looks at how resourceful street hawkers, using cheap and unique ingredients, offer delicious street food to slum-dwellers of Asia.\nCATCH ME IF YOU CAN\nBig Mama serves an unusual dish of “Dancing Shrimp” salad (Goong Ten), named so because the shrimp are very much alive and jumping on the plate when they are served.\n“They dance and make a sound ‘kadok-kadok’,” she described. “Sometimes, people cannot grab any shrimp because they have all have jumped off the plate.”\nThe freshwater shrimp, typically used to feed fish, are found in the canals or rice fields of Thailand.\nAfter tossing together some fish sauce, toasted rice powder, chilli, herbs and sour lime juice, Big Mama uses a net to scoop a fistful of shrimp from a fish tank, emptying them briskly into the mix.\n“When the shrimp mix with the chilli, lime and fish sauce, they start dancing,” she said.\xa0\nWATCH:\xa0The street food of Bangkok\'s most notorious slum (full episode, 23:00)\nShe sells this dish at 50 baht (S$2.10) a packet, and says that she cannot price it any cheaper as the ingredients are expensive. She advertises her food - which includes another signature dish, grilled pork kidney - on social media, and takes delivery orders by phone,\xa0\nEvent organiser Sombatsara Teerasaroch reveals how each “spoonful of shrimp will explode in your mouth” as the fresh ingredients and garnish react with the enzymes in one’s saliva.\n“It makes everything sweet and complete in your mouth. My mouth is watering,” he laughed. “I think it is an amazing dish. It’s a Thai sashimi.”\nBLOOD AND ISAAN FOOD\nEven more of an acquired taste is Sirathorn’s dish of meat salad with bile and blood (Larb Lerd Sook), which she also sells for 50 baht from a pushcart.\nSirathorn hails from the Isaan region in northeastern Thailand. Isaan cuisine, which uses fermented and preserved ingredients, is known for its fiery, sour and pungent dishes.\nTo extract the bile, Sirathorn boils the gall blader of a cow and cuts it open – whereupon the green-coloured bile oozes out “like sugar syrup”, she said.\n“That’s how you know it is good quality bile. If it is not fresh, it will flow out too quickly,” she added.\nThis bile is then added to diced beef, chilli, toasted rice powder and herbs, and stir-fried. Sirathorn also adds diluted blood to the mix.\n“Blood must be used in every Isaan food stall. Without it, the food will not be considered authentic,” said Sirathorn. “Bile is for customers who like their food slightly bitter.”\nHer customers are mostly office workers and the area\'s residents. “I earn barely any profit, but I do not want to increase my prices, so that the less affluent customers can still buy our food,” she said.\nShe added: ""I never imagined that we would have so many customers supporting us. No matter what people say about Klong Toey, we make a living here - so it is good.""\n', 'related_topics': ['     food ']}"

      How Chinese fried noodles by a Muslim hawker became a hit in India’s biggest slum
  </h1>, 'text': 'MUMBAI: In the middle of Dharavi, one of Asia’s largest slums, there is a popular Chinese fried noodle dish which has been given a unique Indian spin.\nSohrab’s Chow Mein is this curious half-Indian, half-Chinese hybrid dish of yellow noodles stir-fried in a wok with cabbage, green capsicum and flavoured with an oddly bright-red Manchurian sauce.\nIt’s the brainchild of slum resident Sohrab, who had previously worked in a Chinese restaurant.\n“I came up with an idea to start my own street food business. This is my special dish. The customers love it,” he said.\nThis type of Chinese-Indian cuisine is a kind of “Chinese food which no Chinese has ever heard of”, said celebrity chef Vicky Ratani. “It’s India’s gift to the rest of the world. It\'s really good!”\nSohrab’s peculiar creation to cater to his customers is a reflection of the ethnically and racially diverse settlement of Dharavi – where a mix of Hindus, Buddhists, Christians, and Muslims like Sohrab live and work together, all desperate to escape poverty.\nWATCH: Feeding The Dream: Street Food From Dharavi, Mumbai (full episode, 23:00)\nTHE MOST LITERATE SLUM IN INDIA \nIn Dharavi, a thriving community of leather tanners, potters, tailors and street hawkers have sprouted over the years.\nSohrab’s food stall is one of 5,000 businesses operating there and, together with 15,000 small-scale factories, they form the slum’s informal economy.\nVendors like Sohrab keep their prices cheap for the poorer residents. ""I cook because I love people. It’s okay if you don’t have the money to pay for the food. You can still eat at my stall,"" he said.\nHe rents a small room in one of the dilapidated buildings where he lives with his family, including his wife, daughter and grand-daughter.\n“We try to fit everything inside because the bigger rooms cost more. We can’t afford anything other than this right now,” he said.\nEvery day, the whole family chips in to help prepare the food for his business. His other Chinese-Indian speciality is Manchurian Balls, or cabbage fritters with Manchurian sauce, a thick glutinous sauce believed to have been created in the 1970s by Nelson Wang, a Chinese chef born in Calcutta.\nSohrab said he can earn up to 25,000 rupees (S$460) a month, enough to send his children to school.\n“That is why we live in Dharavi – because here we can make a living, eat well and educate our children,” he said.\nIt is estimated that one million people live in Dharavi, and with a literacy rate of 69 per cent, this is the most literate slum in India.\nFellow street hawker Malai recounted how his mother was often asked by others why he was selling idlis (a type of savoury rice cake) even though he is well-educated.\nMalai and his brothers were one of 600 families who had migrated to Dharavi from Madurai, Tamil Nadu.\n“My parents told me that the idli business is very profitable,” he said. “My idli business is doing well… The only drawback is the lack of quality sleep and you need to put in a lot of hard work.”\nEvery morning, this idliwalla and his brothers spend up to two hours travelling to different precincts in Dharavi to peddle their South Indian breakfast staples of idlis, medu vadas (deep fried fritters) and dosas (rice pancakes).\n“We need to travel really far in order to sell our food. But we make good money, that’s why we do it,” he said.\n“There is no place in central Mumbai like Dharavi. All of us Tamilians are in the Idli business in Dharavi.”\n\n', 'related_topics': ['     food ']}"

      How Manila’s slum hawkers turn unwanted food into delicacies for the poor
  </h1>, 'text': ""Tondo, Manila: In its simplest form, monok is an unsophisticated Filipino dish that consists of shredded chicken fried with vinegar, onion, soy sauce and chilli.\xa0\nBut, too poor to afford fresh meat, street hawker Loida has come up with clever ways to make it such that the underprivileged can afford – even if this means recycling food destined for the dustbin.\nUsing chicken left over from hotels, Loida peels off the meat, re-cooks it and sells it cheaply at just 15 pesos (S$0.40) a plate in Tondo, one of the most impoverished slums in Manila where the poor often scavenge for discarded food from garbage sites.\nThe chickens from the hotels are usually simmered to extract\xa0the\xa0flavour in making stock.\n“So the meat is tasteless at the end but instead of throwing it away, they sell it to the delivery guy for extra cash. This is the side hustle of hotel cooks,” said Loida.\xa0\n“Initially, some people said that monok (spicy double-cooked chicken) was dirty…(But) this way, the less fortunate can be fed and there is less food wastage since it is still clean.”\nFor those living in slums, eating well and having delicious food is a dream – but the new documentary series Slumfood Millionaire celebrates the resourcefulness and talents of street hawkers living in the poorest districts of the world’s most densely populated cities, such as Manila, Mumbai and Bangkok.\nWATCH:\xa0From Offcuts To Delicacies In Manila's Biggest Slum\xa0(23:00)\nUsing cheap and often overlooked ingredients, these individuals have become experts at making signature dishes unknown to many but those living in the area – such as grilled frog (Phnom Penh) and creamy pufferfish stew (Kota Kinabalu).\nTHE LESS THEY HAVE, THE MORE THEY GIVE \nIn the episode on Manila filmed before the COVID-19 lockdown, Loida is seen hauling her blue pushcart filled with plastic bags of chicken, spices, sauce bottles and a cooking\xa0gas cylinder through narrow alleyways, before setting up shop at a busy road junction.\nThis stall was passed down from her late mother, and Loida used to watch her prepare the dish – simmering the chicken pieces in vinegar, spices and dark soy sauce before frying it to achieve that spicy, sour flavour with a crunchy texture.\nLiving in this neighbourhood where some residents survive on just US$400 (S$540) a year, Loida said: “I know what it’s like to have nothing to eat, to be hungry. I even knocked on my neighbours’ doors to ask for money.”\nSo her service to the community is to keep her dishes affordable.\nA customer told Loida that she used to spend 500 to 600 Philippine pesos (S$14 to S$17) a day on food as she has eight children, until she discovered Loida’s monok stall selling cheap and delicious food.\nSlumfood Millionaire director Ericson Gangoso said the production crew were especially moved by Loida’s caring spirit for others, and unwavering dedication to her family.\xa0\n“Loida is a selfless woman, helping to raise her nephews, prioritising them over her own needs. It made us realise that the less people have, the more they give,” said Gangoso.\nHe described how every profile in the series – from those living in the slums of Manila to those in Bangkok and Mumbai – are local heroes of their neighbourhoods where “everyone knows them by name”.\n“We would often be filming with them and a resident would walk past, saying ‘Auntie Loida! Are they filming your story?’” Gangoso added. “We were humbled to learn about their struggles, how they are working to make their lives better, and how they make their food with pride.”\nHe said that all the neighbourhoods were noisy as the houses are closely packed, and there was always something happening –be it birthdays, karaoke sessions or people preparing meals.\n“Each neighbourhood was filled with smells. Every hour of the day, someone’s always cooking, and you can smell the aromas from every kitchen. You’re always hungry when you smell the delicious aromas in the slum,” said Gangoso.\nCONTROVERSIAL DISH\nIn the Manila episode, street hawker Rado also showed how he uses unwanted organs to make tumbong (pork intestine soup), which veteran food writer Felice Prudente-Sta Maria describes as “controversial for some because it is the part of the intestine that is closest to the anus”.\xa0\nThis is why Rado insists that the offal be thoroughly scrubbed with salt and rinsed several times to get rid of the nasty bits. The cleaned intestines are then boiled with onions and pigs’ heads for three hours to extract the essence from the bones.\nThe result is a rich, flavourful broth, which is why there’s always a long queue for it.\nEmbark on a mouth-watering journey through the slums of Asia.

      5 Bali restaurants popular with tourists and how they are faring during COVID-19
  </h1>, 'text': 'BALI: With a menu in her\xa0hand, a waitress sat idly at the\xa0main entrance of a restaurant\xa0in Ubud, a Balinese town\xa0famous for its thriving art scene and stunning landscapes.\xa0\nIt was lunchtime and the street in front of her was quiet, as it has been since the pandemic began.\nAlong the once busy street, waiters and waitresses from other restaurants stood or sit\xa0in front of their establishments, trying to woo the handful of tourists.\nInside, the restaurants were\xa0completely vacant and for some, it would stay that way until\xa0they closed their doors for the day.\nTourism is the backbone of Bali’s economy and COVID-19 has devastated the livelihoods of residents on the\xa0Island of the Gods.\nBali, which recorded the first COVID-19 death in Indonesia in March, has a total of 7,380 cases so far, while the national tally now stands at over 225,000.\nCases in Bali has more than doubled since Jul 31, when the government eased restrictions for domestic tourists. On that day, the island\'s total caseload was 3,407.\xa0\nAlthough Bali has never formally imposed a lockdown and continues to allow businesses to remain open, travel restrictions across the globe has reduced international tourist arrival to almost zero.\nWith Indonesia suspending\xa0its visa-free and visa-on-arrival policies for international travellers, tourists are effectively dissuaded\xa0from coming into the country.\xa0\nLast month, Coordinating Minister for Maritime Affairs and Investment Luhut Binsar Panjaitan said the\xa0policy would likely remain in place until the end of the year, adding that the tourism industry would probably\xa0return to the way it was before the pandemic by the end of 2021.\n\n\nMeanwhile, domestic tourists are still nervous about travelling by air - the main way to get to Bali - choosing instead to vacation somewhere they can get to by car.\nThe dramatic drop in tourists has affected restaurants, big and small, all across Bali from the hilly towns of Ubud and Kintamani to the beaches of Kuta and Seminyak.\nMore than half of\xa0the restaurants on the resort island have to reduce their employees’ salaries and working hours by 75 per cent, while some have to downscale their operations, according to the business operators.\nThe rest chose to close their doors temporarily and put their staff on unpaid leave, including some well established and award-winning eateries. \xa0\nHere are five popular restaurants in Bali which have been struggling since the pandemic hit:\nIBU OKA\'S BABI GULING\nBefore the pandemic, tourists and locals would crowd all three outlets of Ibu Oka\'s babi guling (spit-roasted pig)\xa0restaurant with queues snaking down the pavements of downtown Ubud.\xa0\nThe restaurant, opened in 1979, has a reputation of being the place to savour Balinese-style suckling pig stuffed with a combination of spices like turmeric, lemongrass and coriander seeds and roasted until\xa0the skin is crispy.\xa0\nIbu Oka\'s babi guling is so famous it has\xa0attracted food writers, bloggers and television hosts from all over the world, including the late Anthony Bourdain.\xa0But the pandemic changed that almost overnight.\xa0\n""It has been very quiet,"" one staffer told CNA as she cleaned rows of empty tables and chairs during what would otherwise be a bustling lunch hour.\nIt usually took just a few hours for the dish to be sold out after the outlets opened at 11am, but now they have to stay open until 6pm.\nThe original small shop in front of the Ubud Palace appeared deserted last week,\xa0with only a few waiters waiting for customers to come.\xa0\nIt was the same for the outlet on Jalan Tegal Sari, tucked behind a crowded housing area just a few hundred meters away and Jalan Raya Mas on the edge of town.\nThe restaurants were deprived of its usual hustle and bustle, the chatter of hungry customers and the hurried scene of fire pit masters preparing the dish.\n\nMADE’S WARUNG\nWith its signature nasi campur (rice with mixed meat and vegetables), Made’s Warung, established in 1969, was among the first eateries in Bali to put the island on the world’s culinary map.\nThe establishment has come a long way from its humble beginnings, a small shop made from wood and woven bamboo\xa0with no flooring near the popular Kuta Beach.\nIt has since become a restaurant chain with four restaurants in Bali - including one at the Ngurah Rai airport - and a franchised outlet in Jakarta.\nBut when the pandemic hit, Made’s Warung had to\xa0close all of its four restaurants in Bali for dine-in.\xa0\n“The number of tourists has dropped significantly,” I Ketut Triana, a member of the family which owns Made’s Warung told CNA, adding that the chain was seeing a 90 per cent reduction in the number of customers before they shut the doors on Mar 21.\nTriana said for months, nearly all of their employees were put on unpaid leave. \xa0\xa0\n“In mid-April we decided to open our Seminyak outlet for deliveries and takeaways. We hoped that by doing so, we could at least cover our electricity and water bills which we have to pay whether we are open or closed,” he said.\n\n\nThe family subsequently decided to reopen its Seminyak and Berawa outlets on Jun 24 since the two areas still have some tourists and die-hard surfers staying in cheap lodges and hotels.\nBut the restaurants are only making a fraction of what they used to make before the pandemic while its employees now only work seven days a month and earn one-fourth of their previous salaries.\xa0\nThe employees at the other two smaller outlets are still forced to take unpaid leave.\nAt Seminyak, there could only be between 20 and\xa0100 customers a day out of a seating capacity of 200, Triana said.\xa0\nBefore the pandemic, the restaurants were so busy the staff always had\xa0a hard time finding seats for customers, he said, particularly during school holidays and around New Year.\n“We are starting to see some income but it is only enough to cover for our operational expenses,” Triana said.\nBEBEK BENGIL\nFamed for its crispy duck, the 3,500 sq m Bebek Bengil restaurant in Ubud has been a favourite culinary destination for high ranking officials from Jakarta and international tourists arriving in big buses and minivans.\nThe 30-year-old establishment could\xa0attract so many customers that\xa0there would always be traffic in front of the restaurant, with cars and buses jostling for parking spaces. \xa0\xa0\nBut now, it only serves\xa030 to 60 customers a day, a far cry from the usual 500 customers. \xa0\nAnak Agung Raka Sueni, who founded Bebek Bengil in 1990, said she had to close two outlets in Jimbaran and Nusa Dua\xa0in the southern part of Bali\xa0because of COVID-19.\nShe insisted on keeping the original Ubud restaurant open, even when customers dropped by more than 90 per cent.\n\n\n“Since COVID-19 hit Indonesia in March, we started to see less customers. We struggled to pay our employees,” Sueni told CNA.\nEven as the Ubud restaurant began to see more deliveries and takeaways these days, the restaurant only saw an income of 3 million rupiah (US$202) a day, a significant drop from the usual 70 to 100 million rupiah a day.\nThe Ubud restaurant survived because many locals and expatriates frequented the establishment.\nMeanwhile, the Nusa Dua and Jimbaran outlets saw their income almost completely gone because of the declining number of tourists. The Nusa Dua outlet reopened on Jul 9, after the government relaxed restrictions on domestic travels.\nLike Made’s Warung, Bebek Bengil made its 80 employees in Ubud and 50 employees in Nusa Dua work for seven days a month with a severe pay cut. “That is the only way everyone can keep their job and have an income,” Sueni said.\nThe restaurant is providing some financial aid for the 30 employees in Jimbaran who are now on unpaid leave. \xa0\n“We are still struggling financially. That affects our ability to help our workers. Because the situation has been going on for so long and we don’t know when this will end, we can’t keep providing them aid,” she said.\xa0\nINDUS\nLocated atop a picturesque hill in Ubud\xa0overlooking the Campuhan Valley and Bali’s sacred volcano Mount Agung, the Indus restaurant is\xa0on a hiatus.\xa0\nThe restaurant, famous for being one of the venues for the Ubud Writers’ Festival, originally served an eclectic selection of Balinese, Indian and Western dishes, and has always appealed to\xa0international tourists.\nThe owner’s son, Krishna Suardana, decided to open a wood-fire pizza place on Jun 22\xa0at Indus to attract the local market.\n“Indus is not originally a pizza place. For me, it’s just something to do during corona. I have been very interested in pizza making and it’s a good time to learn if I ever want to open my own pizzaria,” Suardana told CNA.\n“(Pizza) is also perfect for takeaways, deliveries or dine in. It’s perfect for people who are still afraid of going out. It is something that is easy to cook, sell and deliver, and it is loved by everyone.”\n\n\nOriginally, Indus only had three pizza variants on its menu, but Suardana expanded the pizza menu to eight. He even put a local twist to the Italian dish by creating pizza ayam kremes (crunchy chicken) and babi kecap (pork soy sauce).\n“We try to sell affordable pizza, with prices starting at 50,000 rupiah (US$3.36). Right now we are enjoying a tiny bit of profit,” he said adding that for now, he is limiting his production to 30\xa0pizzas a day because of unstable demand.\nDemand was unstable that there were days when he would not sell a single pizza. To cope with this, he decided to only open Indus from Fridays through\xa0Sundays when demand\xa0is\xa0high.\nThe restaurant has been relying on donations from its former patrons to provide financial aid to its 40 workers.\xa0With Suardana’s pizza venture slowly taking off, he can start to rehire some of the employees.\n“First it was just me, the manager and a driver. We recently employed another helper. It’s expanding. But we might need to change the name because (Indus) is not supposed to be a pizza place.""\nCASA LUNA\nJanet De Neefe, the owner of Casa Luna in downtown Ubud is also thinking about deconstructing its menu.\nFounded in 1992, Casa Luna has always been geared towards Western tourists and expatriates living in Ubud who see the restaurant as a key place to gather and socialise.\nOn a busy day, her 200-seat capacity restaurant could be completely full. \xa0\nBut De Neefe said since the pandemic, many expatriates have returned home as encouraged by their respective governments. \xa0\xa0\nThose who stayed, she added, are only those who have lived in Bali for years and became quite attached to the island and its way of life.\nMeanwhile, domestic tourists only come during\xa0long weekends and school holidays, and they typically prefer to eat somewhere more affordable.\n“My demographics have always been Westerners. That is our challenge. We have to rethink our menu and pricing to target domestic tourists,” she told CNA.\nCasa Luna employs 60 people who now earn half of what they used to make.\n“If we’re lucky we can get 2 million (rupiah) a day and for our operational costs we need about 5 million a day. We’re operating at a loss but we’re hanging in there. We’re losing thousands of dollars a month, for sure,” she said.\nDe Neefe said she will not give up on the restaurant.\xa0\n“We have to help everyone survive. We will never close and we never had. This is our community centre. This is where everyone gathers,” she said.\xa0\n\n\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\n', 'related_topics': ['     Indonesia ', '     Bali ', '     tourism ', '     COVID-19 ', '     food ', '     restaurant ']}"

      Rice that tastes like ‘first love’? A social enterprise wants to share this love
  </h1>, 'text': 'It started in 2015 with that most humble Asian staple: Rice.\nMelisa Lim, Chan Zi Xiang, Chia Yong Ling and Lilian Chen – project coordinators for a non-profit organisation – were managing the building of infrastructure in rural East Malaysia when they chanced upon the best rice they had ever tasted on a field trip to Sarawak’s Long Semadoh Valley.\nThe rice turned out to be an heirloom variety grown by the indigenous Lun Bawang community in the Lawas highlands. Chen compared the sensation of eating the rice to “first love”, while Lim described the fragrance, taste and texture of the grains as “unforgettable”.\nHeirloom rice is grown using paddy seeds that have been inherited and passed on from one generation to the other within rural communities. Typically, these paddy seeds are saved every year after harvest and then replanted the next year.\n“They are truly as original as rice can be and represent the terroir of the land. If the saved seeds are not replanted, they will slowly disappear from the communities,” explained Lim.\n“This is very much unlike commercial paddy seeds which are purchased for planting and are more likely to be GMO. Heirloom seeds are crucial as they reflect not only resilient crops that have withstood the test of time, but more importantly, the culture and heritage carried on by the indigenous farming communities.”\n\n\nThis evocative experience was the seed that grew into Langit Collective, a social enterprise aimed at ensuring smallholder farmers in rural communities receive a fair income for their valuable grains.\nComing from diverse backgrounds – an actuary, a designer, a chiropractor and print producer – all four had abandoned their careers in their late 20s to join local non-profit, Impian Malaysia, in search of new experiences.\nThis is how four Kuala Lumpur-based urbanites came to experience rural East Malaysia at its rawest and got to know the difficulties its communities faced. Working for a non-profit further reinforced in the group that economic empowerment rather than a charity model was more sustainable in the long term to improve these communities’ livelihoods.\nAround the end of 2015, the intrepid foursome decided to validate their idea by selling the heirloom grains they had enjoyed so much to their friends – they managed to sell 30kg in just two days.\nTo establish a framework for Langit, they enrolled into the MaGIC (Malaysian Global Innovation & Creativity Centre)\xa0accelerated programme for local social enterprises. This four-month-long course covered every topic from ideation all the way to the final product. It saw them through from starting operations and establishing supply chains to arranging transportation and applying for licenses.\nGetting the farmers onboard was another kettle of fish, however.\n“With rural farming communities, it’s not easy to promote an unproven concept. They are very pragmatic and want to see proven results before taking a plunge. Partly because many organisations have introduced projects that have no continuity,” explained Lim, who is Langit’s CMO (Chen is CEO, Chan is CFO, and Chia is CTO).\nLangit currently promotes heirloom rice and grains from Long Semadoh and Long Sukang in Sarawak; spices like ground ginger from Keningau in Sabah; and single-variety peppers from Serian, Sarawak.\nNaturally, their core products are heirloom rice varieties: Beras Adan, Beras Salleh, Beras Sia’, Beras Keladi and Beras Rumie (beras means rice). The names reflect what the farmers know them as in their respective indigenous languages.\nThe ruby coloured Sia\' means red in Lun Bawang, while Keladi denotes yam to echo the grain’s purplish hue. Adan and Salleh were named after the people who introduced the seed variety to the community. Rumie is the only one named after a farmer who does her own seed selection of her best black variety every year.\nThe unique flavours of the various rice varieties have been celebrated on the menus of KL’s finest restaurants, such as Dewakan (ranked No. 46 in Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants 2019), which dedicated a porridge dish to Beras Keladi.\nLim recalled how it was tough at first getting Langit’s rice into these establishments because they weren’t an established supplier and were selling local rice at an unheard-of price point. However the product spoke for itself and found an advocate in Dewakan’s exacting head chef Darren Teoh.\n“Our partnership with Dewakan grew organically from there as our values are aligned when it comes to celebrating underrated, local Malaysian ingredients, appreciating local farmers and advocating sustainability. And through this partnership, we gradually got connected to a network of like-minded chefs through word of mouth,” Lim explained.\nFive years on, Langit has grown their work from creating market access to actively looking at ways of improving their farmers’ farming practices – such as by using regenerative methods and/or adopting the appropriate technology.\n“We acknowledge that in order to have good, nutritious food and even achieving a big vision of creating a sustainable future starts from the soil, the people who work the land, and the biodiversity that nature provides,” stated Lim.\nLangit’s business was not spared from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, with losses from their B2B clients who had to stop operations. However, sales from their e-commerce platform helped them to pull through. While Langit’s range is available in specialty stores, business is done predominantly online.\xa0\nCurrently their main market is Malaysia but they are in the midst of testing shipping to Singapore: ""Our product can be quite fragile and gets bruised during delivery. Once we can find a good solution, we are definitely looking to ship internationally as there is a growing interest out there.""\n', 'related_topics': ['     food ', '     Malaysia ', '     Singapore ', '     Asia ', '     Restaurants ']}"

      4 products touted to have slimming effects found to contain banned substance, laxative: HSA
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Four products touted to have slimming effects and sold online have been found to contain “potent ingredients"" – including a banned substance and a laxative – which could cause “serious adverse effects” in consumers, the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) said in a news release on Thursday (Sep 10).\nIt cautioned members of the public not to buy or consume Nutriline Thinsline, Nutriline Cleansline, KiMiSo Dark Chocolate and Wholly Fitz Passion Lemon Tea.\nNutriline Thinsline was found to have sibutramine, a substance banned in Singapore, while Nutriline Cleansline contained sennoside, a laxative.\nKiMiSo Dark Chocolate contained both sibutramine and diphenhydramine, an antihistamine. Wholly Fitz Passion Lemon Tea\xa0had sibutramine in it.\nSibutramine has been banned in Singapore since 2010 due to an increased risk of heart attacks and strokes for those who take it.\nDiphenhydramine causes drowsiness, which can pose a risk if consumers drive or operate machinery.\nWOMAN REPORTS IRREGULAR HEARTBEAT, AMONG OTHER EFFECTS\nAfter consuming one sachet of Nutriline Thinsline, a woman reported to HSA that she experienced “extreme thirst, irregular heartbeat and loss of appetite”, the authority said.\nDuring investigations, HSA found that this product was usually sold together with Nutriline Cleansline. It tested both products and found sibutramine in Nutriline Thinsline and sennoside in Nutriline Cleansline.\nBoth these products were marketed as natural supplements for weight loss and detoxification, with claims to control appetite and increase metabolism.\nIn June 2017, HSA had also cautioned about another Nutriline product, Nutriline Bluvelle, which was also tested to contain sibutramine. It had caused increased heartbeat, dizziness and anxiety in a consumer, HSA said.\nPRODUCTS RAISED SUSPICION AMONG CONSUMERS\xa0\nAccording to HSA, several other customers gave\xa0feedback on two other suspicious products – KiMiSo Dark Chocolate and Wholly Fitz Passion Lemon Tea.\nA woman suspected that KiMiSo Dark Chocolate might contain potent ingredients after reading the reviews on the product.\nThe product was marketed to have the ability to “intensely burn fat” and “promote weight loss”, with “no laxatives” and “no side effects”. When HSA tested the product, it found sibutramine and diphenhydramine.\nSimilarly, another person contacted HSA saying they suspected Wholly Fitz Passion Lemon Tea, marketed to “keep the fat away”, was similar to Freaky Fitz Passion Lemon Tea, which was found to contain sibutramine by HSA earlier this year.\nBoth products had the same list of ingredients printed on their packaging, including juice powders and extracts.\nHSA found the tea also contained sibutramine.\nHSA ISSUES WARNINGS TO SELLERS\nThe authority advised consumers to stop taking the four products immediately and to see a doctor if they feel unwell or are concerned about their health.\nIt added people should be wary of products that make exaggerated weight loss claims or deliver unexpectedly quick effects, as well as to avoid purchasing products from unfamiliar sources and to exercise caution when buying products online.\n“HSA has issued warnings to the sellers of these four products and directed the respective website administrators to take down the affected listings,” HSA said, noting the products were sold on local e-commerce platforms such as Shopee and Qoo10, and social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram.\n“All sellers and suppliers must stop selling these products immediately. It is illegal to sell and supply adulterated products containing banned substances or potent medicinal ingredients,” HSA said.\nSellers and suppliers, if convicted, could face up to two years in jail and/or fined up to S$10,000.\n', 'related_topics': ['     HSA ', '     food ', '     health ']}"

      Post-circuit breaker, Singapore’s high-end restaurants are thriving. Here’s why
  </h1>, 'text': 'Had you ventured to Amoy Street last Friday, you would have witnessed a steady stream of cars winding their way through the narrow lane, horns blaring as vehicles stopped, with little warning, for passengers to alight in front of a restaurant.\nIt was a similar scene along Keong Saik Road, as cheerful Singaporeans made their way to their favourite eateries and queued for coveted seats at the likes of zichar stalwart Kok Sen.\nInside the acclaimed dining rooms within these enclaves, diners supped on elegant dishes featuring the likes of caviar and truffles, knocked back cocktails and sipped on wine. Anyone without a reservation would have found themselves back out on the street as restaurants report full houses on weekends, having been booked weeks in advance.\n\n\nA post shared by Odette (@odetterestaurant) on Mar 24, 2020 at 2:21am PDT\nWhat a difference five months make. In April, these same restaurants were mired in a vastly different story. After months of poor traffic, as fear of the coronavirus kept people indoors, eateries found themselves deep in the red. And as the country stared down the barrel of a two-month lockdown, the prognosis was grim.\nEventually, Government grants and wage off-sets from the Resilience, Unity and Solidarity Budgets weathered restaurants through the storm. And as the country returned to its new normal on Jun 19, the “revenge dining” began. Singapore’s denizens flocked to restaurants and malls, relieved to be out and about again, and to share a meal with friends and family, albeit in groups limited to five.\n\n\nBACK TO BUSINESS\n\n\nA post shared by Restaurant Nouri (@restaurantnouri) on Jun 24, 2020 at 3:13am PDT\n\n\n“We clocked our second highest sales in our restaurant’s history in July.” – Ivan Brehm\nBy the end of July, numerous restaurants reported some of their best performances in years. “We clocked our second highest sales in our restaurant’s history in July,” said Ivan Brehm, chef-owner of upscale restaurant Nouri. “(It was not) our highest sales only because we weren’t able to do events.”\nIt was a similar story at other restaurants including modern Spanish establishment Esquina and Italian fine diner Buona Terra. “Our restaurant was extremely busy in July and August, with an increase in lunch crowds as people returned to support their favourite restaurants,” explained Buona Terra’s resident chef Denis Lucchi.\nNot only are diners back in force, they are also spending more time in their choice restaurants. “They seem to have more flexibility in their work hours so they can have a leisurely meal. Additionally, with the travel restrictions in place, many diners have stayed in Singapore instead of travelling for their summer holidays,” Lucchi added.\n“Our restaurant was extremely busy in July and August, with an increase in lunch crowds as people returned to support their favourite restaurants.” – Denis Lucchi\nBETTER THAN EVER\nIt’s a good thing then that chefs like Lucchi are dishing out food of higher calibre than ever before. Regular diners at contemporary restaurants such as Buona Terra, Meta, and Roketto Izakaya have noticed a marked improvement in the food at their favourite restaurants post-lockdown.\n“It’s like the chefs have so much pent-up creativity that they weren’t able to express during the Circuit Breaker,” joked Ling Lee, an avid foodie who dines at restaurants like the aforementioned at least thrice a week.\nS Lim, another regular diner at upscale restaurants, observed a marked improvement at Michelin-starred establishments Odette and Meta immediately after the Circuit Breaker.\n“My wife and I weren’t expecting much when we first went back to these restaurants. We just wanted to support our favourite businesses,” he said. “But we were blown away by their improvements. The chefs at Odette had been off the pass for months, but there were so many new dishes that were really balanced. It’s some of the best food we’ve eaten from them. Meta, too, had really stepped up. They had clearly done a ton of R&D during the lockdown so that they could launch these new, excellent dishes.”\nWhen asked if there was any truth to these observations, chef-owner of Roketto Izakaya Willin Low said, “I think we all got a chance to hit the reset button during the Circuit Breaker. Yes, we were scrambling to pivot to delivery and whatever it took to keep us afloat, but chefs are creators, and it’s not often we get much free time to really formulate ideas. The pause that was forced on us during the Circuit Breaker afforded us time to hone new dishes and really refine them.”\n“Chefs are creators, and it’s not often we get much free time to really formulate ideas.

      Are healthier instant noodles really healthy? After the hype come the checks
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: As comfort food to many Singaporeans, instant noodles tide us over on time-starved days and overtime shifts, and double up as a late-night indulgence.\nApart from the convenience, many people return to their favourite brand for its flavour. Instant noodle fans know they are not eating these quick-fix meals to reap health benefits.\nIn an online Nielsen poll in July, 49 per cent of the 201 respondents said they eat instant noodles for the “yummy/delicious” taste, while 35 per cent considered instant noodles to be their “comfort food”.\nOnly 24 per cent eat instant noodles for the healthier versions.\nYet, these healthier varieties have gained in popularity, with sales increasing by about 35 per cent in the first six months of this year, compared to the same period last year, noted Singapore’s largest supermarket chain, FairPrice.\nAmid the growing demand, the question remains: Are they really healthy and all they are cut out to be? The programme Talking Point finds out four things about healthier instant noodles and whether these justify jumping on the bandwagon. (Watch the episode here.)\n1. WHAT’S THE HYPE?\nFirst, healthier instant noodles are typically marketed as “non-fried”.\nPrima Taste, for example, has produced air-dried wholegrain instant noodles since 2015. Wholegrains have been known to reduce stroke, the risk of high cholesterol and the risk of heart disease, says assistant general manager Melvin Tjahaja.\n“There’s no added oil in the cooking process or in the drying process. As a result of that, our noodles have very low fat content — less than two per cent,” he adds.\n“From what I know, regular instant noodles, which have gone through the flash-frying process, contain 15 to 20 per cent of fat.”\nThere are also baked and air-dried\xa0noodles.\n2. THE INGREDIENTS CHANGE, BUT THERE’S STILL WHEAT FLOUR\nRegular instant noodles are made of refined wheat, which is known to be stripped of nutrients like fibre and minerals. That is why some manufacturers might opt for raw materials other than wheat for instant noodles.\nBut some non-wheat varieties are not exactly free of refined wheat, as explained by chef and food writer Sarah Benjamin Huang.\nFirst, Bambara groundnut noodles: They contain twice as much protein as typical instant noodles and are loaded with fibre, which makes for a healthy gut. One also feels fuller for longer after eating these noodles.\nSecond, moringa leaves noodles: These are packed with two to three times more fibre than regular wheat instant noodles.\nThese two instant noodles seem healthier, but the catch is that they are not 100 per cent made up of nuts or leaves. Those ingredients come in around fourth on the list, says Huang.\nThe thing that makes noodles and pasta “really chewy” is wheat flour.\n“You need the gluten from the wheat flour to hold the noodles together,” she adds. “You do have to have that as the main component if you want that familiar slurpy texture.”\nThird, aloe vera noodles: They still contain a regular amount of wheat, except aloe vera is used to replace water in the manufacturing process.\nThis makes these noodles healthier by increasing the amount of potassium, which works in tandem with sodium to control blood pressure.\nFinally, konjac noodles: These shirataki-based noodles are Japanese noodles made from konjac yam and are low in carbohydrates and calories. Unlike the previous three examples, konjac noodles do not contain wheat.\nHuang says 100 grammes of regular instant noodles contain about 60g of carbohydrates and 400 calories. Konjac noodles, however, contain only 1g of carbohydrates and around 15 calories for every 100g of noodles.\nThis is “almost a negligible amount of carbs, so these are perfect for anyone who’s on a low-carb diet for medical reasons, or if you’re doing (the) keto (diet), which is very popular these days”, she adds.\nKonjac noodles also contain a soluble fibre called glucomannan, which helps to reduce the risk of heart disease.\nAs healthy as these alternative versions might be, Huang maintains that as a chef, “taste is number one”.\n“If these healthier options don’t taste as good, they don’t feel as good texture-wise, then it’s not going to scratch the itch of the occasional instant noodle craving,” she says.\n3. THE DEVIL IS IN THE SEASONING\nThe stuff that gets people hooked, however, is not actually the noodles. “The soup or the sauces are the more sinful part. The noodles are just noodles,” says Ramen Lab chef consultant Jason Lim.\nWATCH: Are ‘healthier’ instant noodles really better for you? (2:45)\nBut how does the seasoning in healthier instant noodles compare with regular ones?\n“Air-dried noodles are healthier than fried noodles in terms of the noodles itself, because they have a much lower amount of fat. But that doesn’t mean their seasoning is healthier,” says Temasek Polytechnic food science and nutrition lecturer Guo Ren.\nThe trick is to look at the sodium content on the packaging, he adds, citing the three instant noodle seasoning samples brought in by Talking Point.\nSample A, from fried noodles, contained 873mg of sodium per 100g. Samples B and C, from air-dried noodles, contained 742mg and 1,300mg respectively, proving that the method of cooking the noodles is unrelated to the sodium level in the seasoning.\n“What does it mean? It could mean the manufacturer is trying to compensate for the lack of oil and frying,” he says. “Air-dried is nowhere near fried noodles in terms of the flavour fullness. So some would put more sodium.”\nEliminating MSG in particular does not necessarily mean healthier either, as manufacturers may add other flavourings.\n“For example, things like hydrolysed vegetable protein and yeast extract. Now these are natural flavourings, but they impart that umami flavour, that ... savoury flavour,” dietician Jaclyn Reutens tells Talking Point in a separate interview.\n“Things like inosinate and guanylate, which are artificial flavourings, also impart that umami flavour. But they’re also really high in sodium.”\nTo decrease their sodium intake, consumers could use half a packet of seasoning or make their own seasoning or broth for their noodles.\nOtherwise, one could look out for instant noodles with less than 400mg of sodium per 100g, or less than 8g of saturated fat per 100g.\n4. HEALTHIER NOODLES COST MORE\nThen there is the camp who turns to instant noodles because of affordability. In the Nielsen poll, 45 per cent of respondents said they eat instant noodles for this reason.\nHealthier instant noodles, however, tend to be more expensive. In the long run, these few dollars and cents add up. And these noodles are not necessary, especially if one is strapped for cash, Reutens told CNA Insider.\nAlthough they are low in calories and high in fibre, which is why they are considered healthier, one can get fibre from fruits and vegetables. One can also eat less for a lower calorie intake.\n“Instant noodles are the carb portion of a meal. (You) can get the same nutrients in normal white rice. You can buy dried bee hoon or wholemeal bee hoon, which is so much cheaper. That’ll give you carbs as well as fibre,” says Reutens.\nHealth food marketing, she notes, tends to focus on quinoa and organic foods, which are relatively expensive.\n“But you can also eat healthily on much more affordable options. I’ve seen wholemeal bee hoon selling at the same price as normal, white bee hoon. Yoghurt is cheaper than ice cream. Low-fat milk is sometimes cheaper than almond milk,” she says.\n“The common misconception is that healthy foods are tasteless and more expensive. But you don’t have to spend a lot if you know how to do it.”\nWhere marketing gimmicks are concerned, the dehydrated corn and vegetable garnishes typically present in instant noodle seasonings are for “visual appeal”, adds Reutens. “They don’t increase the nutritional value very much because the dehydration strips away their nutrients.”\nWatch this episode of Talking Point here.

      Celebrity chef Rachel Khoo: Can eating a plant-based diet really save the world?
  </h1>, 'text': 'It\'s a question that many of us have grappled with – should you go vegan to give the planet a better chance of survival? As a trained patisserie chef famed for her love of butter, the writer, cook and broadcaster Rachel Khoo asked it of herself more than most – and then decided to truly do something about it, by diving headlong into the plant-based food debate with her new eight–part documentary podcast series, A Carnivore’s Crisis.\n\n\nA post shared by Rachel Khoo (@rachelkhooks) on Jul 29, 2020 at 1:33pm PDT\n\n\nHer ultimate mission? To unravel whether beef and dairy–based diets really need to die in order for the planet to live. It\'s a massive undertaking, so the British celebrity chef, known for her TV shows such as The Little Paris Kitchen and Rachel Khoo\'s Kitchen Notebook, spoke to activists and chefs, farmers and academics from California to New Zealand, all to “sift truth from propaganda” as she puts it.\nWe talk via Zoom with Khoo in London, the city where she was born. When not travelling – at least in normal circumstances – she lives in Stockholm with her husband and children, but her upbringing was that of a global citizen. Her mother is Austrian while her Malaysian-Chinese dad moved to the UK from Ipoh, his family having originally immigrated to George Town, Penang. Khoo grew up in the UK and also lived for a few years near Munich, then moved to Paris after university to follow her passion and study patisserie at Le Cordon Bleu.\nIt seems pretty fitting then that her cookbooks have been translated into multiple languages and her TV shows aired around the world. I\'d met Khoo in person a year previously, at a dinner in Tokyo, ironically in a restaurant famed for high-end wagyu beef. She couldn\'t divulge it at the time, but she was then wrapping the production of A Carnivore\'s Crisis. So why undertake such a substantial investigation into the debate on going vegan?\nShe added that these broad perspectives helped her to “cut through the noise and the big headlines”, avoiding general statements because “things aren\'t as simple as that”. Over more than four hours of the Audible podcast, she certainly delivered on her promise to dig deep and allow multiple voices to be heard.\nOne of the most striking comments in the podcast came from London–based French restaurateur Alexis Gauthier who explained to Khoo why he had completely changed the menu at his one Michelin–starred restaurant to vegan.\nHe told her it was his “moral duty”: ""When a pig is slaughtered it has the IQ of a three–year–old. You\'ve got children right? I\'ve got children too. When mine were three years old they could feel love, they were happy, they were scared, so knowing that, every time I served a delicious pork chop to my customers, I said to myself that\'s just not possible. We need to move.""\nIt\'s a profound and compelling argument, one of many which pepper the podcast series and underscore its mission. But Khoo also stressed that she had to remember she was investigating meat and dairy more from a point of sustainability, rather than morality.\nAs such, she spent a lot of time with different farmers, learning how they treat and raise their animals. In episode four, for example, cutely titled 50 Shades of Farming, the focus is on Australia and New Zealand where the impact of cattle on the land, meat processing plants and plant-based meats all went under the microscope.\nTowards the end of the series, she met farmers who said that a global shift to veganism could actually be worse for the environment than continuing to farm beef and dairy.\xa0Khoo also has a fascinating insight on hunting, thanks to living in Sweden.\n""My food journey is always evolving and I\'m always open to learning more. Working and living in Sweden, being exposed to the culture of hunting and game meat, you realise it\'s not bloodsport, it\'s actually super organised.\n“If you think about it, it\'s like organic farming on another level. These animals are free-range, they don\'t get transported onto some truck to the abattoir. They are shot quickly, the death is quick, but people stop as soon as they hear ‘hunting’.”\nKhoo previously spent time working at the legendary (but now-defunct) Swedish restaurant Faviken, led by chef Magnus Nilsson.\n”[Nilsson] said that he had chicken when it was a really special occasion because they mostly just ate game. Sweden has 10 million people but is twice the size of the UK. I think each country has to work with what is most sustainable for them.\n“When I think about my grandma in Austria up in the Alps, they take the cows up into the mountains in the summer. They graze in the summer, they make beautiful Alpine cheese from the milk but you can\'t farm anything on those mountainsides because they\'re too steep.”\nFarming is one thing, but our consumption is the day-to-day reality, both in shopping and cooking. Khoo has asked herself how she can be more mindful with how she eats.\n""Obviously I come from a very privileged situation, I can go to the supermarket and make these choices of buying ingredients, I can buy better welfare meat and organic produce. When I lived in east London, when I was a student, I had mainly fried chicken restaurants around the corner, I had no access to fresh fruit and veggies there. So I think simplifying things by saying, \'everybody should go plant-based’, that\'s a generalisation.""\nAs far as cooking is concerned, she sees it as a powerful act of ownership.\n""There\'s always so much guilt around food and life is about joy and pleasure and that\'s my way of writing recipes. That\'s the biggest thing, when somebody cooks, you\'re taking control of your diet. You\'re taking the power away from the big manufacturers and the highly processed food. You\'re doing something great for yourself, your loved ones. That\'s my mission.""\nUltimately – having dived so deeply into one of the biggest issue of our times – what would her advice be with regards to veganism?\n""It\'s about making small adjustments. As Jonathan Safran Foer said in his book Eating Animals, if everybody just ate one plant-based meal a day that would already have a huge effect. I\'ve always been like that if I\'m going to buy meat. I don\'t buy it every day, but when I do, I just make sure I spend a little bit more money and get meat from better welfare. I\'m fortunate I can do that.\n“With my dad being Malaysian, for example, from his side of the family meat was always more of a garnish then the main. I\'m definitely advocating more mindful eating, maybe less animal products, but for me there\'s still a place for it. I just see it as being more selective of where you source it.""\nIt\'s a typically measured response which reflects one potential solution to the crisis that carnivores continue to go through. One thing is clear though: Khoo is not going to stop delving, investigating and learning.\n""This podcast series felt like it was the tip of the iceberg and when I came away from it, my mind was frazzled. I realised you do the best you can in the situation you are in. I think it\'s a Buddhist saying that if you tread lightly, you’ll do the least damage, so be mindful.”\n“I\'m definitely advocating more mindful eating, maybe less animal products, but for me there\'s still a place for it. I just see it as being more selective of where you source it.” – Rachel Khoo\n', 'related_topics': ['     celebrity ', '     Chefs ', '     food ', '     F&B ', '     sustainability ', '     Profiles ', ""     Women's Voices ""]}"

And the wait is worth it.\xa0\nHer abacus seeds (think of them as yam gnocchi) are the best we’ve sampled, with an irresistibly chewy bite and lots of flavour thanks to plenty of minced pork, sliced black fungus, dried shrimp, squid and mushrooms.\xa0\nThe nasi ulam, a true labour of love requiring hours of slicing innumerable herbs to fine-haired strands, is also a study in balance of flavour and dedication to a vanishing craft.\nSUGURU HOME DINING’S JAPANESE DISHES\nFor five years, Desmond Heng ran a successful HR agency supplying part-time staff to hotels in Singapore.\xa0\nThe premise is simple yet undeniably appealing. Desmond imports premium ingredients such as Bafun and Murasaki sea urchin and Hokkaido scallops from Toyosu Market in Tokyo, and serves them on beds of chilled truffle-scented somen.\n\n\nA post shared by Suguru Home Dining (@suguruhomedining) on Aug 30, 2020 at 8:42pm PDT\nHe also sells sides of soft-cooked eggs topped with marinated chum salmon roe or more coral tongues of sea urchin. Jesslyne Lee and Lim Han Song, employees from his HR company, work alongside him in his home kitchen.\nReviews of his offerings have been suitably rave. While the flavour-saturated dishes are simple, they feel like special treats thanks to the swimmingly fresh Japanese seafood. And at prices starting from S$28, they are relatively affordable luxuries too.\nLEVELLED’S DESSERT BOXES\nWorking from home during the circuit breaker\xa0gave operations manager Michelle Tan plenty of time to indulge in her favourite hobby: Baking. She’d spent over a year perfecting her caneles – delicate Bordeaux pastries defined by a crackly caramelised shell and custardy brandy-spiked insides – and fudgy filled brownies.\nEach week, the couple makes about 50 pastry boxes filled with a trio of caneles and a quartet of brownies. Orders are taken online on Tuesdays and delivered on weekends.\n\n\nA post shared by Levelled ◒ (@levelled.sg) on Aug 9, 2020 at 12:48am PDT\nSince they established the business in June this year, the couple have sold more than 600 boxes. They still work full-time for their employers (Cheong is a qualified barista and sales and relationship manager for a local coffee wholesaler) and run Levelled on the side.\nLevelled’s dessert boxes sell out in minutes when orders open at 8pm on Tuesdays, so should you be quick enough to score a box, expect flawless caneles perfumed with dark rum and vanilla, or in seasonal flavours like rose and calamansi, and Manjimup black truffle.\xa0\nThe brownies – sticky, chewy, and delectably dark – are filled with the likes of cookie butter, Ovalmaltine and peanut butter and jelly.\nTIKY MOCHI MUFFINS AND CUPCAKES\nAfter folding her online clothing store in 2018, Kyer Say turned her attention to baking her favourite treats: Mochi muffins (chewy mini cakes made of glutinous rice flour) that she’d enjoyed on her regular trips to Taiwan and Japan. By 2019, she had perfected the recipe and began selling them to friends.\xa0\nIn February 2020, her husband Juzantino Junaidi, a cabin crew with Singapore Airlines, realised that the pandemic would\xa0severely affect his income in the coming months. “So he told me now’s the time to really get this business going, especially since no one else is selling mochi muffins,” said Kyer.\nJuzantino took photos of his wife’s creations and posted them on his social media platforms. “That first day, I got one sale, which grew to 10, and by the power of social media, the business took off,” she chimed.\xa0\n\n\nA post shared by TIKY MOCHI MUFFIN (@tikymochimuffin) on Aug 31, 2020 at 4:44am PDT\nSince February, the couple have sold about 20,000 mochi muffins and cupcakes in flavours like chocolate chip, matcha, salted caramel and blueberry cream cheese.\xa0\nThe pretty mochi confections boast thick crusts with faintly chewy centres; the cupcake versions are topped with silky buttercream. The couple makes 30 boxes a day, from Wednesday through Saturday. Orders open at noon every Sunday on their website and are wiped out within 15 minutes. Things are going so well that they are currently looking for a commercial kitchen in order to expand production.\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     dining ', '     food ', '     delivery ', '     Instagram ', '     Restaurants ']}"

      M&amp;S tries to tap into food delivery boom to halt decline
  </h1>, 'text': 'LONDON: Britain\'s Marks & Spencer (M&S) will make the first deliveries through its new online food shopping joint venture on Tuesday, a cornerstone of its latest attempt to turn the company around and offset problems at its pandemic-hit clothing business.\nOnline grocery shopping has doubled its share of the UK market to 14per cent since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and M&S\'s joint venture partner Ocado reckons it could reach 30per cent over the next few years.\nThat is making M&S more confident about its 1.5 billon pound (US$2 billion) deal to create Ocado Retail, which initially came under fire from some investors for its lofty price tag.\n""When we did the Ocado acquisition and we had to have a (600 million pounds) rights issue to finance it, I think it\'s fair to say that shareholders were pretty divided,"" M&S Chairman Archie Norman said last month. ""We\'re not hearing any scepticism now.""\nBut the 136-year-old mainstay of Britain\'s shopping streets could do with a flawless launch after a decade of failed revamps and amid plunging sales in clothing and homewares.\nThe company, whose shares have nearly halved this year, said last week it was axing 7,000 jobs and that general merchandise sales slumped 49.5per cent year-on-year in the 19 weeks to Aug. 8, which included most of Britain\'s coronavirus lockdown period.\nWhile food halls stayed open, sales still fell 1.1per cent as many shoppers stayed at home and ordered from rivals with online businesses. Ocado, for example, saw sales growth top 40per cent in the lockdown and was forced to stop registering new customers.\nM&S\'s new online food venture is key to achieving its goal to double the size of its 6 billion pound food business.\nThe venture ends Ocado\'s long running supply contract with upmarket chain Waitrose and will see some 4,500 Waitrose products replaced by around 6,500 provided by M&S.\nWhile it is now taking on new customers, Norman told a shareholders meeting last month there would be constraints while delivery capacity is built up.\n""There should be in time room for everybody, but it is going to take time,"" he said.\n(Reporting by James Davey; Editing by Mark Potter)\n', 'related_topics': ['     delivery ', '     business and finance ', '     Britain ', '     food ']}"

      Bjorn Low: ‘Every Singaporean can help Singapore become more food resilient’
  </h1>, 'text': ""A phone conversation with local urban farmer Bjorn Low is routinely punctuated by the chitter of insects and trill of birds. It's an impossibly idyllic yet fitting mise en scene, considering that his social enterprise has been widely credited for reconnecting asphalt-accustomed Singaporeans with nature.\nSince its inception in 2012, Edible Garden City (EGC) has helped individuals and restaurateurs build and maintain edible gardens, while running community farms that provide employment and therapeutic benefits for the elderly, differently abled and marginalised.\nBut beyond this seemingly utopian model of community-led, environmentally conscious agriculture, looms an issue of national urgency – food security.\n\n\nTHINK GLOBALLY, GROW LOCALLY\nWith the ongoing pandemic underscoring the need for Singapore to ramp up food production – the island state imports more than 90 per cent of its food from overseas – much attention has been cast on the Singapore Food Agency's (SFA) 2019 goal of producing 30 per cent of Singapore's nutritional needs by 2030.\nFor veteran urban farmers such as Low, the ‘30 by 30’ ambition – now tagged with a S$30 million grant – is the denouement of a growing effort to bolster food security.\n“We constantly face threats to our food supply system, such as Malaysia raising the prices of chilli every year. The issue is just a lot more distinct during this period as we are facing a global challenge, and people are starting to realise that we are vulnerable in Singapore,” he said.\nWhile COVID-19 has highlighted the importance of accelerating food production locally, the overarching question, Low asserted, is how the world makes a concerted effort to address its food system's sustainability issues. In the upheaval of the pandemic, global supply chain disruptions compelled farmers around the world to dump their produce, exacerbating a perennial problem of food wastage. According to the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO), an estimated 1.3 billion tonnes of food are wasted or lost annually.\n“The big issue is that food systems have become so efficient because of technology, that we actually have a glut of food that is not getting to where it is supposed to as a result of economics. Due to the scale at which these systems have to run, there are centralised food production zones where agricultural and infrastructure services are congregated. But COVID-19 has shown us that such models are vulnerable to sudden changes,” Low explained, further citing the environmental cost of transporting food across the world as a factor that's oft-neglected.\nThe answer to that conundrum may lie in smaller scale, decentralised urban farms. And EGC's rooftop plots, crowning malls that abut busy thoroughfares, neatly fit that description.\nAmong them is Funan mall, which supplies Spa Esprit Group's Japanese restaurant NOKA. “Urban farming gives us the opportunity to really try out decentralised farming systems that are closer to the community, but because of the scale of production they are still not financially viable. With a diverse model like ours, where we grow food and also run community impact programmes and lifestyle events, we can keep our heads above water,” said Low.\n\n\nIt's a modest metaphor drawn by someone whose social enterprise has grown from an initial capital of S$10,000 to attaining a revenue of S$1.7 million in 2019. This takes into account an approximately 20 per cent rise in revenue from EGC's foodscaping (the practice of integrating edible plants into ornamental landscapes) services from 2018.\nIn fact, over the circuit breaker it charted a 40 per cent increase in enquiries from homeowners over those services. In efforts to continue on its growth trajectory, the social enterprise has applied for the government's 30X30 Express grant, as well as participated in a tender for rooftop spaces on HDB multi-storey carparks.\n“We are optimistic about ‘30 by 30’, with the government strongly pushing urban farming by injecting funding and spreading awareness among locals. We have also personally noticed more Singaporeans supporting local agriculture, and choosing to buy local produce over imported varieties,” shared Low.\nHe does, however, contend that more can be done to realise the aforementioned goal.\n“The strong backbone of every industry is a skilled and dedicated workforce. With farming, we have many Singaporeans willing to rise to the challenge and take up the job, despite how tough it can be. Yet, there is a lack of training facilities and educational programmes they can attend to boost their farming knowledge and skillsets. Most of the courses currently available are related to gardening, with some focused on indoor farming. We hope to see more courses that explore bio-dynamic farming, as well as other natural farming methods,” said the 39-year-old.\n\n\n Looking to grow your own vegetables?\u2063 \u2063 No backyard?

The former ad man can rattle off a compendium of information about the merits of closed-loop agriculture, which EGC practises – where composted waste is used to fertilise the soil – as well as the healing benefits of farming.\nIn fact, EGC helped facilitate a clinical research study by National Parks Board and the National University Health System (Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine), which demonstrated that therapeutic horticulture improves the mental health and well-being of the elderly.\n\n\nIn that vein, it runs urban care farms as social spaces where the elderly can acquire new skills – including Ah Gong Farm in low-income neighbourhood York Hill Estate – and is in the process of strengthening its therapeutic horticulture capabilities. This includes getting staff accredited as horticulture therapists and retro-fitting existing farms with wheelchair accessibility features.\n“Last year, it was reported that Singapore spends about S$3.1 billion on stress-related illnesses annually, and this will continue to escalate as the population gets older. If we are able to keep people meaningfully engaged through jobs in urban agriculture and potentially take them out of social isolation, we could potentially stop a huge healthcare crisis,” said Low.\nThe biophilia hypothesis, which suggests that humans possess an innate tendency to seek connections with nature and other forms of life, appears to be a concept that EGC is firmly rooted in.\nBut with Singapore developing a sophisticated 18ha agri-tech park in Sungei Kadut, and the country advancing towards increasingly mechanised agricultural techniques to reap more fulsome harvests, are we at risk of further weakening our tenuous relationship with nature?\nNot given to sententiousness, Low argues that R&D investment is key to carving a more lucrative agricultural sector in land-scarce Singapore.\n“Singapore can become a regional hub for major agri-research, whether it is through creating the next chemical fertiliser or GMO seed. Though those are against some of my principles, they are important innovations and we already have the structure and support systems to do these things,” he said.\nEGC's agricultural methods, like its business model, are diverse. Alongside its outdoor soil-based gardens, insect farm and indoor hydroponics system, it recently launched a new venture with Japanese agri-tech firm Farmship to grow speciality Japanese vegetables such as Komatsuna and Wasabina in a 20 ft. container equipped with cloud technology.\nFor now, Low maintains a pin-sharp focus on farming for positive social and environmental impact, while raising awareness of the country's urban farming scene.\n“Every Singaporean can do [his/her] part to help Singapore become more food resilient. These efforts are not limited to buying local produce or having their own herb garden; it could be by volunteering, reducing food waste, or even patronising eateries that buy from local farmers,” he concluded.\n“Every Singaporean can do [his/her] part to help Singapore become more food resilient.

      You probably won’t catch COVID-19 from frozen food, say experts
  </h1>, 'text': 'NEW YORK: Amid a flurry of concern over reports that frozen chicken wings imported to China from Brazil had tested positive for COVID-19, experts said Thursday (Aug 13) that the likelihood of catching the virus from food — especially frozen, packaged food — is exceedingly low.\n“This means somebody probably handled those chicken wings who might have had the virus,” said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University.\xa0\n“But it doesn’t mean, ‘Oh my God, nobody buy any chicken wings because they’re contaminated.’”\nGuidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention maintain that “there is no evidence to suggest that handling food or consuming food is associated with COVID-19"".\xa0\nThe main route the virus is known to take from person to person is through spray from sneezing, coughing, speaking or even breathing.\n“I make no connection between this and any fear that this is the cause of any long-distance transmission events,” said C\xa0Brandon Ogbunu, a disease ecologist at Yale University.\xa0\nWhen the virus crosses international boundaries, it’s almost certainly chauffeured by people, rather than the commercial products they ship.\nThe chicken wings were screened on Wednesday in Shenzhen’s Longgang district, where officials have been testing imports for the presence of coronavirus genetic material, or RNA.\xa0\nSeveral samples taken from the outer packaging of frozen seafood, some of which had been shipped in from Ecuador, recently tested positive for virus RNA in China’s Anhui, Shaanxi and Shandong provinces as well.\nLaboratory procedures that search for RNA also form the basis of most of the coronavirus tests performed in people. But RNA is only a proxy for the presence of the virus, which can leave behind bits of its genetic material even after it has been destroyed, Ogbunu said.\xa0\n“This is just detecting the signature that the virus has been there at some point,” he said.\nTo prove that dangerous, viable virus persists on food or packaging, researchers would need to isolate the microbe and show in a lab that it can still replicate.\xa0\nThese experiments are logistically challenging and require specially trained personnel, and aren’t a part of the typical testing pipeline.\nAfter samples taken from the surface of the meat came up positive, officials performed similar tests on several people whom they suspected had come into contact with the product. They also tested a slew of other packaged goods.\xa0\nAll samples analyzed so far have been negative for coronavirus RNA, according to a statement released by the Shenzhen Epidemic Prevention and Control Headquarters Office.\nBut the same statement cautioned consumers about imported frozen products, and early reports of the news sparked alarm on social media.\nBoth Ogbunu and Rasmussen said that an extraordinarily unusual series of events would need to occur for the virus to be transmitted via a frozen meat product. Depending on where the virus originated, it would need to endure a potentially cross-continental journey in a frozen state — likely melting and refreezing at least once along the way — then find its way onto someone’s bare hands, en route to the nose or mouth.\nEven more unlikely is the scenario that a virus could linger on food after being heated, survive being swallowed into the ultra-acidic human digestive tract, then set up shop in the airway.\n“The risks of that happening are incredibly small,” Rasmussen said.\nSome viruses might be able to weather such an onerous pilgrimage. But the coronavirus probably isn’t one of them because it’s a so-called enveloped virus, shrouded in a fragile outer shell that’s vulnerable to all sorts of environmental disturbances, including extreme changes in temperature.\nViruses are often frozen in laboratories that maintain stocks of pathogens for experiments. But virologists must monitor that process carefully to avoid destroying the vulnerable bugs.\n“The act of freezing and unfreezing is a kind of violent thermodynamic process,” Ogbunu said.\xa0\n""A virus, for all its toughness and robustness, is a very delicate instrument of infection.\n""The CDC has noted that “it is possible” that the coronavirus can spread through contaminated surfaces, including food or food packaging. But that’s not known to be among the main ways the virus gets around.\nIf you don’t want to get infected, avoiding direct contact with other people is probably a better use of your time, Ogbunu said.\n“Yes, we should continue to wash our hands and be mindful of surfaces where a lot of individuals are,” he said. “But it’s close proximity to others that can really facilitate transmission.”\nBy Katherine J Wu\xa0© The New York Times\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\n', 'related_topics': ['     COVID-19 ', '     food ']}"

      Who are the K-chefs helping to popularise Korean cuisine around Asia?
  </h1>, 'text': 'Long before jjapaguri noodles from Parasite became one of Asia\'s hottest dishes, Korean chefs have wowed the palates of gourmands and casual diners alike. With technical prowess, executional excellence and a reputation for innovation, a number of them have also taken their considerable talents to cities across Asia.\nAlongside the explosion in popularity of Korean culture, in the form of K-pop, movies and K-dramas, these K-chefs have truly blazed a trail, showing the diversity of their nation\'s classic dishes but also how creativity has inspired them to new culinary heights.\nOne of the most prominent names leading the charge is Chef Mingoo Kang. One of Asia\'s most accomplished and exciting Korean chefs, with his Seoul restaurant Mingles holding two Michelin stars as well as thirteenth spot in Asia\'s 50 Best Restaurants, the softly-spoken maestro has just opened fine dining destination Hansik Goo in Hong Kong.\nHis tasting menu twists Korean classics, elevating flavours that are served in an elegant, calming space conceived by JJ Acuna / Bespoke Studio. Standouts from the eight-course lunch tasting menu (HK$780/S$140) included an exceptional roulade of chicken breast and leg, atop a samgye risotto that boasts the comforting and warming notes of Korea\'s famed ginseng chicken soup.\nOther twists on Korean traditional dishes features multiple versions of jang, the fermented sauce found on any Korean table; a delicious beef tartare; as well as the familiar delights of bulgogi beef, to be wrapped in lettuce leaves, ssam style.\nFrom Hong Kong to Bangkok, where Lauren Kim is a young chef celebrating the food of her homeland. She comes from a family of famed restaurateurs and chefs in Seoul, but 13 years ago she moved to Bangkok when her mother opened a restaurant there.\nAfter training at Le Cordon Bleu and time in restaurants such as Hisa Sushi in Osaka, she opened her first restaurant, Banjoo. Today she has a second Banjoo, Charm Korean Steakhouse and even her own range of Korean sauces, pastes and ingredients called Banjoo Banchan, all made in-house using recipes straight from her grandmother.\nShe explained how she feels perceptions of Korean food have changed in recent years: “On one side, Korean food has become more accessible over the world and won some hearts. That Oldboy scene of the protagonist eating san-nakji – raw octopus that is still squirming – has gradually given way to more visually appealing and tasty dishes, while there are fun experiences like Korean BBQ and the superfood status of kimchi.\n“But on the other side, Korean food is vast and complex, traditionally slow food in preparation and in eating. To give you a perspective, it takes us two days to make natto ferment to use in our dishes. It take four weeks to ferment garlic to be able to use in our dishes. And so on… it’s a slow prep cuisine. Natural umami takes time to develop.”\nMeta in Keong Saik Road needs little introduction to Singapore foodies, having blazed a trail with Chef Sun Kim’s mix of Korean heritage, Japanese technique and Western training. Short for \'metamorphosis\', Meta lets Chef Kim take diners on remarkable culinary journeys that underscore the constant flux of evolving dishes.\n\n\nA case in point is a dish that Kim says defines both him and Meta, his abalone from Jeju.\n""Being Korean, I wanted to showcase the good quality of seafood from South Korea and Abalone from Jeju island is known to be of the highest quality around the world.\n""The abalone dish has always been evolving, I started off showcasing it served with a dashi\xa0multigrain risotto (buckwheat, barley, lentils), then changing the way in which the risotto is cooked by using a flower crab stock. Now in the latest version of this dish I utilise the whole abalone, by using the abalone livers to make a sauce that goes perfectly with the multigrain risotto.""\nHe also explains why he thinks Korean food has become so popular, both in\xa0Asia and globally: ""Korean food is very approachable as the hearty portion sizes are generally bigger than most and easily shared amongst family and friends. The taste profile is quite different to other Asian food as Koreans love to preserve vegetables such as cabbage, radish, garlic shoots, perilla etc. I feel this is what entices people to try Korean food in the first place.”\n""Korean food is very approachable as the hearty portion sizes are generally bigger than most and easily shared amongst family and friends.” – Sun Kim\nIn Shanghai, Ryu Taehyeok at Jeju Izakaya is another chef changing and challenging perceptions of Korean cuisine. Notoriously difficult to book, the tiny spot in a typical Shanghai house has won multiple awards and public acclaim for its inventive cuisine.\nChef Ryu, known as Tom, explained the Korean scene in Shanghai: ""In the past, inexpensive, traditional dishes such as Korean BBQ, Bibimbap and Bulgogi were generally perceived as Korean food but nowadays there have been many new and creative attempts, which have led to more diverse views. Korean food has recently been very popular in Shanghai and some of the popular Korean restaurants are difficult to book.”\nHe said that three dishes are indicative of their approach, starting with Chungmu Gimbap, a dish with rice mixed with sesame oil that is wrapped in sweet laver, eaten with semi-dried anchovies and fresh uni mixed with gochujang paste.\nFinally to Seoul itself and a woman recently named Asia\'s Best Female Chef, Cho Hee-Sook. She has spent more than 40 years in the industry, combining running iconic restaurants with teaching the next generation as a professor at Woosong University. It\'s no surprise, then, that she\'s known as the “Godmother” of Korean cuisine and feted by chefs such as Mingoo Kang.\nToday she\'s chef-owner of Hansikgonggan, a restaurant that preserves the foundations of Hansik (Korean Cuisine) from Royal palace cuisine through to local dishes. The restaurant offers breathtaking views of Changdeokgung royal palace and serves “traditional flavours with contemporary sensibilities”, while they also hold one Michelin star.\nA dish she chooses to highlight – although it\'s a difficult choice to make – is bugak: ""Bugak is made by thinly slicing vegetables or seaweed that are coated in a glutinous rice paste. It has to be dried for up to three days and then deep-fried before serving.\n“People usually think Korean food is spicy and salty. But I find more and more… international foodies are starting to recognise how subtle and delicate the cuisine is. Traditional Korean jang (sauces), kimchi and jang-a-chi (pickled foods), preserve seasonal ingredients for a long time – techniques that were passed down by our wise ancestors.""\nThat wisdom is something that has enabled Korean cuisine to survive and flourish, with the responsibility taken on today by leaders like Chef Cho.\n""I feel very responsible for the title of \'Godmother\'. Passing down my knowledge of traditional Korean food is very important too. But I want them to understand that what they do can contribute to the health and mental well-being of guests. Working as a chef can also immensely impact the environment. I hope for them to pay particular attention to this.""\nWith that sort of dedication and focus on the bigger picture, it\'s clear that Korean cuisine has a bright future in Asia – and well beyond.\n“People usually think Korean food is spicy and salty. But I find more and more… international foodies are starting to recognise how subtle and delicate the cuisine is.” – Cho Hee-Sook\n', 'related_topics': ['     Korea ', '     food ', '     Restaurants ', '     Singapore ', '     Bangkok ', '     Hong Kong ', '     Seoul ', '     Shanghai ', '     Fine dining ', '     Chefs ']}"

      Mexico's new warning labels on junk food meet supersized opposition from US, EU
  </h1>, 'text': 'MEXICO CITY: The United States, European Union, Canada and Switzerland, home to some of the world\'s biggest food companies, have pressed Mexico to delay upcoming health warnings on processed food and drinks, a World Trade Organization document showed.\nThe Mexican standard, scheduled to take effect in October, will require front-of-pack nutrition labeling that clearly describes the health risks posed when those products are high in sugars, calories, salt, and saturated or trans fat.\nMexico, the largest consumer of processed food in Latin America and the fourth-largest in the world, has long struggled with high rates of obesity and diabetes. That health crisis has been exacerbated by the novel coronavirus, which hits people suffering from those illnesses particularly hard.\nObesity reached epidemic proportions in Mexico after it joined the North American Free Trade Agreement with the United States and Canada in the early 1990s, making processed food more easily available, several studies have shown.\nLast week, the southern Mexican state of Oaxaca banned the sale, distribution and advertising of junk food and sugary drinks to children, becoming the nation\'s first state to do so.\nAccording to WTO minutes of a May 13 - May 14 meeting of the Committee on Technical Barriers to Trade, published on Monday, the US\xa0delegation said it supports Mexico\'s public health objective of reducing diet-related non-communicable diseases but that it was concerned the planned labeling may be ""more trade restrictive than necessary to meet Mexico\'s legitimate health objectives.""\n""Mexico has chosen more stringent nutrient thresholds than the thresholds set by other countries,"" the US\xa0delegation said, citing the views of the government and nine trade groups.\nThe United States, Switzerland, Canada and the EU opposed the Oct\xa01 implementation date. Washington and the EU sought a two-year delay while Canada asked for the start to be pushed back 12 months. Switzerland urged postponement without specifying a timeline.\nWashington said a delay was needed ""in light of the COVID-19 global pandemic, which has placed significant pressure on the food and beverage industry"".\nThe Mexican government did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But a Mexican government official with knowledge of the matter, who declined to be named, said: ""We told them there would be no additional time.""\nPepita Barlow, assistant professor of health policy at the London School of Economics and Political Science, said countries that are home to major multi-national food corporations such as Switzerland, the United States and EU most frequently opposed new food standards, focusing on trade costs and profits.\nThe Mexican government official said the countries opposing Mexico\'s standard were acting in a last-ditch effort to derail the changes and putting their concerns ahead of public health.\nThe Mexican private sector has also opposed the new rules. Jaime Zabludovsky, president of lobby group ConMexico which represents food and beverage companies, recently said the labels would confuse the public, according to Mexican media outlet Aristegui Noticias.\nThe government official said Coca-Cola , Pepsi\xa0, Nestle and Mexican breadmaker Grupo Bimbo were among companies that asked for a delay.\nThe companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

      Meet the millennial leading Singapore icon Killiney Kopitiam into the future 
  </h1>, 'text': 'For many Singaporeans, a breakfast\xa0of crispy butter and kaya toast, watery soft-boiled eggs and a cup of kopi\xa0is somewhat of a morning ritual. Even as the city modernised and transformed through the decades, the kopitiam breakfast has proven to be a cultural mainstay.\nKilliney Kopitiam is one of Singapore’s oldest coffee shops, established in 1919 by a Hainanese immigrant from China. Formerly known as Kheng Hoe Heng Coffeeshop,\xa0it was bought over by regular customer Woon Tek Seng in 1992, who renamed it according to its location on Killiney Road.\nWoon Tek Seng, along with his three\xa0brothers, eventually transformed Killiney Kopitiam into a chain of mass-market coffee shops. Today, there are 30 Killiney outlets in Singapore, most of which are franchise outlets with the exception of three that the group owns and operates.\nThe traditional coffee and toast breakfast may be here to stay, but Killiney Kopitiam has had to modernise aspects of the business to keep up with the times. Leading the charge is 33-year-old Woon Tien Yuan, nephew of Woon Tek Seng and the company’s current director.\nPASSION FOR ART\nContrary to what some may think, a role at Killiney was never handed to Woon on a silver platter. In fact, his father discouraged him from joining the company, citing the many challenges that come with running F&B businesses, such as high rental and manpower costs.\n“He used to tell me that working in an F&B business is not a fantastic opportunity, and if I had better options outside of the Killiney, I should explore them,” Woon shared.\nInstead, after graduating from NUS Business School, Woon started off by managing the family’s art foundation, where his passion lies. The Woon Brothers Foundation seeks to promote art education, art collecting and support the needy. Woon is an avid art collector himself, with his own private art museum located on the second floor of Killiney’s Lorong Telok outlet. \xa0\n“My uncle had a private home museum and I spent many weekends there. That’s where I gained\xa0exposure\xa0to different kinds of art,” Woon recalled. Woon started off by collecting cultural pieces from around the region, but he has since incorporated modern art into his collection.\n\n\nA “TWIST OF FATE”\nWoon describes his venture into the Killiney side of the business as a “twist of fate”. One day, he was out jogging when he bumped into childhood friend Yau Png Ow, who runs food tech start-up, Hoow Foods.\n“At the time, Killiney was having some problems with our instant coffee supplier. I asked if Hoow Foods could replicate our current formula, or even come up with a better version,” Woon recalled.\nDuring a family weekend dinner, Woon brought up Hoow Foods to his father and uncles. “Since we had this problem in the business, I asked them to give my friend’s start-up a chance to prove if they could produce a better product.”\nConvincing the family elders was not an easy feat. Generally, business leaders from traditional companies tend to be rather sceptical when it comes to start-ups, especially when these start-ups are involved in new-fangled industries like food tech.\nBut the elder Woons agreed to give Hoow Foods a shot. After several iterations of the product, the team at Hoow Foods managed to come up with a new formula in just a matter of three months. In comparison, the previous product took two years to develop.\n“Taste is very subjective but we have received positive feedback that our new coffee formula has a very appealing bittersweet aftertaste compared to others,” Woon shared.\nThe collaboration with Hoow Foods opens up doors for Killiney to expand its product line and bring them to market in a shorter amount of time. “This was one of my happiest achievements, that I managed to convince my elders to give these sort of high-tech start-ups a chance to prove that they can value-add to our traditional business,” Woon quipped.\nAfter forming a joint venture with Hoow Foods, Woon formally took on the role as Director of Killiney Kopitiam. Together, Hoow Foods and Killiney are working on formulating healthier recipes for the latter’s range of food paste products, which includes laksa, curry, mee siam, mee rebus and more.\nThe two companies are also looking at rolling out other food products that could spin off from Killiney’s line of food pastes, such as laksa-flavoured cookies. “In the long term, we hope to be able to roll out local-flavoured cookies that are healthy, yet don’t compromise on taste.”\n“This was one of my happiest achievements, that I managed to convince my elders to give these sort of high-tech start-ups a chance to prove that they can value-add to our traditional business.""\xa0– Woon Tien Yuan\n\n\nVENTURING INTO E-COMMERCE\nAside from working with Hoow Foods to formulate new products, Woon spends a large chunk of his time formulating Killiney’s e-commerce strategy. While the company had been discussing establishing an e-commerce platform in recent years, Woon admits that it was not a priority for the business prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n“It’s a no-brainer for any F&B business to go into e-commerce. But to really see it materialising is another big challenge. We have to talk about changing all our operations and logistics, and that’s where there’s a lot of resistance in a traditional business,” Woon explained.\nThe circuit breaker period was the push that the company needed to finally delve into the digital world. Aside from having its own online store on the Killiney website, Killiney products are now available for purchase on Shopee and Lazada.\nWoon’s modernisation strategy may not be radical per se, but it’s still a big step for a traditional family business. Though his ideas may be met with some resistance from the company elders, Woon prioritises maintaining family cohesion over pushing his agenda.\n“It’s not that my dad and uncles are micro-managers, but out of respect, I want to keep them updated on projects that I am working on,” Woon clarified. “If I had to choose, I would rather give up a project that would harm the family’s dynamics than to proceed with something when not everyone is on board.”\n“The tricky part of family businesses is striking a balance between planning for business growth and maintaining the family cohesion. But it’s not about getting discouraged when your ideas are turned down, but taking it as a new challenge to think of ways to better convince the family elders,” he explained.\xa0\n“If I had to choose, I would rather give up a project that would harm the family’s dynamics than to proceed with something when not everyone is on board.”\xa0– Woon Tien Yuan\nPRESERVING A HERITAGE BRAND \nFor Woon, joining the family business while others his age are climbing the corporate ladder is his way of preserving the Killiney brand, which has been around for 101 years now. While outsiders may push for Killiney to expand overseas more aggressively, or even reach the IPO stage, Woon hopes to keep the company as a close-knit family business for now.\n“During the last few years, and especially during the recent pandemic, we’ve seen many family F&B businesses close down. It is quite unfortunate if this continues for the Singapore F&B scene,” said Woon.\n“When a company is run by a family, it touches the hearts of consumers. People feel proud that Killiney is truly a Singaporean heritage brand,” he believes.\nThat’s not to say that Woon doesn’t have ambitious plans for the business in the future. Overseas expansion is on the cards, but for the young businessman, it’s not about short-term gains but long-term planning, a skill he has picked up from his passion for art collecting.\n“Collecting art is a very long term journey. You have a big plan in mind with the sort of art you want to collect, and you slowly reach this goal. Sometimes when I have an ideal piece of art in mind that I can’t get my hands on, I know someday it will pop up in the auction house,” Woon shared.\n“In business, this translates to recognising the importance of patience. You must have a goal in mind, then slowly wait for the right moment,” he said.\n“When a company is run by a family, it touches the hearts of consumers. People feel proud that Killiney is truly a Singaporean heritage brand.""\xa0– Tien Yuan Woon\n', 'related_topics': ['     food ', '     F&B ', '     dining ', '     Singapore ', '     Profiles ']}"

      Remember the good ol’ days of buffet spreads? They’re back. Well, kind of
  </h1>, 'text': 'Once upon a time, Singapore made an art of buffet dining. Nowhere else in the world could be found in a single establishment the endless, fine-quality spread of foods like freshly shucked oysters, seafood on ice, cold cuts and quintessential Singaporean dishes like laksa served alongside everything from roasted meats, Indian breads and curries, a la minute waffles, crepes, ice cream, cakes, pastries, cookies… if you could eat it, they probably had it.\nBut, like travelling, the lavish buffets of the pre-pandemic past must be now be set aside for a new, more sensible brand of hedonism. With hygiene now of utmost concern in the new normal, restaurants once celebrated for their unending buffet spreads have had to tamp it down or in some cases, shut it down, at least for the time being.\n\n\nBUFFET, BUT MAKE IT A LA CARTE\nTake Regent Singapore’s Basilico, famed for its bountiful Italian-style Sunday brunch buffets. Its dedicated cheese room, foie gras station and polished countertops that once heaved with the likes of cold cuts, roasts and pizzas, have now given way to modest semi-buffet-style meals. Appetisers like burrata, smoked salmon, poached lobster and Italian cheeses are prepared a la minute and served to the table, while main courses can be ordered off the a la carte menu. Like the appetisers, desserts come in unlimited servings on a platter at the table.\nThe hotel’s popular Manhattan Bar, which used to host boozy Sunday brunch buffets, now sees trolleys holding accoutrements for the likes of Bloody Marys wheeled around from table to table. A menu of five cocktails is crafted behind the bar and hot food served upon order.\nOver at Asian Market Cafe at Swissotel The Stamford, chefs continue cooking at live stations, but buffet items are presented to tables in silver dome sets, harking to the traditional Malaysian way of serving food on special occasions.\n“It’s not likely that we will see buffet dining returning to how it was before COVID-19,” predicted Emmanuel Benardos, general manager of F&B at Fairmont Singapore and Swissotel The Stamford.\n“Guests are understandably more particular about hygiene levels now and this will directly impact how they prefer food to be served to them at the table or from a protected buffet line.”\nThe latter is already being practised at restaurants like One-Ninety at Four Seasons Hotel Singapore, where acrylic guards are placed around the buffet table.\nMeanwhile, at Beach Road Kitchen at JW Marriott South Beach, “Chefs On Show” have taken over the traditional buffet format, with roving live stations and chefs passing around freshly prepared dishes from the extensive buffet menu.\nWEEKEND WILES \nThe Fullerton Singapore’s Town Restaurant, which used to host spectacular daily buffets highlighting local and heritage cuisine, now only opens on Sundays when it serves an a la carte brunch buffet. Popular favourites such as fresh seafood on ice, grilled Angus beef and roasted leg of lamb remain on the menu but are served upon order.\xa0 \xa0\n\n\n Why choose one when you can have it all? Join us for a Sunday feast with brunch staples and all-time favourites, freshly prepared for maximum flavour and delivered to your table.Enjoy seconds, thirds or more! - We didn’t forget the little ones either. Kids aged 11 and under dine free in July and August. So sit back, relax and toast to Sunday brunch with us. - Your safety and well-being remain our top priority.

Cheers!�� #zafferanosg #singapore #brunch #savefnbsg #freeflow\nA post shared by  Rooftop Resturant Singapore (@zafferanosg) on Jun 26, 2020 at 5:24pm PDT\nOther popular buffet restaurants such as Melt Cafe at Mandarin Oriental Singapore are closed until further notice, while The Edge at Pan Pacific Singapore will reopen on Aug 24 for a la carte buffet.\nTHE MERITS OF MODERATION\nThe upside to this new style of buffet dining is less waste as food is served to tables in judicious portions. Guests typically ask for additional servings only when they’ve finished their first. Sous chef of Basilico, Valerio Pierantonelli, said his restaurant has seen a reduction of between 20 to 30 percent of food waste since self-service was discontinued.\n“In addition to generating less waste, there’s also better quality control since food is prepared a la minute and served to the table, which offers an added element of service,” added Angelo Ciccone, executive chef of Regent Singapore. “Stories of provenance can be shared and queries answered immediately, which enhances the interaction between guests and chefs.”\nWhile there is nothing quite like grazing the lengths of an extravagant buffet line, a la carte buffets where food is only handled by service staff will just have to do for now.

      Why is the hottest restaurant in Singapore right now a pizza joint?
  </h1>, 'text': ""It is the name and pizza that’s on everyone’s lips. Even months before the first 18-inch pie was served on our shores, as Singapore sheltered at home during the April-to-June lockdown, all any hipster foodie could talk about was the fact that Brooklyn’s beloved Lucali had opened an outpost here.\nNever mind that most of them had never been to the restaurant in Carroll Gardens or tasted its much-talked-about pizzas. If Jay-Z and Beyonce would ditch the 2012 Grammy Awards to dine at the Brooklyn institution, then surely the pies must be worth the clamour.\n\n\nOLD MEETS ORIGINAL\nTucked away in Kampong Bugis, in an industrial building so old that it’s cool again, Lucali BYGB\xa0was nearly going to be a regular restaurant sans the Brooklyn pedigree. Its American owner Gibran Baydoun (his initials contribute to the Singapore branch’s suffix) had initially conceived a familial restaurant rooted in communal eating and huge pizzas. When he told his friend, Lucali owner Mark lacono, about his plans, lacono was quick to jump in.\n“I never thought this was going to be a Lucali in any way,” said the 31-year-old Baydoun, who spent the last four years in Singapore consulting for establishments such as Adrift by David Myers and private members’ club 1880.\n“Lucali in Brooklyn cannot be duplicated. It’s like a relic, a time capsule of old-school Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin playing in the background, and I felt that this space wouldn’t really match that. So our mission became to create a restaurant that’s about having this feast with friends that’s just fun, no nonsense and simple, but really, really thoughtful. And it just happens that our pizzas and calzones come from Lucali, which is a place that has such magic to me.”\nAnyone who’s experienced the Lucali mothership and comes to its Singapore namesake expecting the same experience would thus be disappointed. The Brooklyn original is, as Baydoun said, inimitably old-school New York-Italian; Lucali BYBG is contrarily cool and buzzy, appointed tuckshop-style with long wooden tables and benches, and purposefully unfinished tile and concrete floors.\nThe menu is simple and compact. There are just three salads; a handful of appetisers; meatloaf; three pastas; a pizza; calzone; and dessert. With such simplicity of choice, the restaurant’s appeal lies in its ambience, energy and service.\n“The last thing I want is for people to come in here and feel like this is a restaurant,” explained Baydoun rather counter-intuitively. “So we try to get away from restaurant terms like ‘are you finished with that’ or ‘are you still working on that’… anything that sounds technical. We want it to feel like home.”\n“The last thing I want is for people to come in here and feel like this is a restaurant… We want it to feel like home.” – Gibran Baydoun\nTACKLING THE INTANGIBLES\nIndeed, it is the abstracts – the unseen, difficult-to-pin-down qualities that make Lucali such a hit in Brooklyn – that Baydoun tries to recreate in his undeniably unique location here. “It really comes down to setting a pace and tone,” he pressed on. “We try to be quick and energetic. The restaurant should always feel buzzy and upbeat, from the music to the way we move.”\nIn that respect, the almost fortnight-old restaurant is succeeding. The dining room was full and in full swing when we rocked up at 6.30pm one weekday evening. “We could only get a 5pm slot, so we took it,” said a friend we bumped into on the way to our table at the back of the dining room. Last we checked, reservations for sensible dinner hours between 7pm and 8.30pm are full for at least the next three weeks.\n\n\nWHICH BEGS THE QUESTION: DOES THE PIZZA LIVE UP TO ITS HYPE?\nIn true New York style, Mark lacono’s Brooklyn pizzas are oversized, rough-hewn and unabashedly simple. Each pie is as unfussy as a hand-formed based topped with a swirl of red sauce and torn mozzarella, and given a turn in the oven before a quick shower of grated Grana Padano and fresh basil leaves. The pies at Baydoun's Singapore chapter are unquestionably different.\n“It’s supposed to be different,” chimed Baydoun. “For one, Lucali has been around for 15 years, so Mark’s pizza oven is 15 years old and it gets better and more seasoned with time. Our oven, though it is designed by the same person who built Mark’s, is new, and we have to wait years for it to cook the same way.”\n“It is what it is,” he continued, knowing full well that comparisons are inevitable. “Mark is very involved and we’re all staying up late every night and making pizzas together. And honestly, nothing will ever be the same as someone’s fantasy of a pizza they’ve never tried or a memory of what they had at Lucali a couple of years ago… It’s just going to be different, but I think it’s pretty damn good.”\nWithout doubt, the pizzas at Lucali BYBG, turned out by chef Ariana Flores (of the now-defunct Osteria Mozza) are rich, chewy and crusty, a cross between a light and blistery Neapolitan-style pizza and its quintessentially dense and drippy New York cousin. The deep, rustic tartness of Roma tomatoes is evident in the red sauce which is shrouded in melted mozzarella that toughens as the pie cools.\nThe 18-inch pies feed four people amply, but bear in mind that there are other excellent options vying for precious stomach space. To wit: The meatloaf made according to Baydoun's mother’s recipe and the spicy vodka rigatoni laced with plenty of kick. The Calzone, filled with buffalo mozzarella and oozing with ricotta, is spectacular and comes with a side of that comforting tomato sauce to dip into. \xa0 \xa0\nSTEADY DOES IT\nThe first three months for many new restaurants in Singapore are typically a whirlwind of wooing media and diners, and grappling with teething issues while running a full house. For a restaurant saddled with as much hype as Lucali is, opening month has been even more fraught.\n“We are just so humbled by the amount of excitement around our opening,” Baydoun said. “I shouldn’t be shocked because if there’s one thing Singaporeans like to do, it’s try new restaurants. We’ve only been open a week and people want to come as soon and as right away as possible. And we’re trying to tell people that we are not a pop-up. We are going to be here for a long time. We have a long lease.”\nIn other words, chill out, folks. The restaurant, and those pizzas, will still be there when the frenzy abates.\n“We are just so humbled by the amount of excitement around our opening… [Although] I shouldn’t be shocked because if there’s one thing Singaporeans like to do, it’s try new restaurants.” – Gibran Baydoun\n"", 'related_topics': ['     food ', '     Restaurants ', '     gastronomy ', '     Singapore ', '     celebrity ', '     Fine dining ']}"

      From Lady M to Luke’s Lobster: The entrepreneur bringing cult brands to Singapore
  </h1>, 'text': ""Caerus Holding may be named after the Greek mythological persona of opportunity, luck and favourable moments. But its CEO Vijay K. Pillai is all carpe diem when it comes to pursuing cult brands to open in Singapore.\nIn 2016, Pillai emailed Jakob Baer Mogensen, chef-owner of Danish pastry brand Leckerbaer to propose the idea of opening in Singapore after researching and reading rave reviews about them online. When he received a somewhat reserved reply, he lost no time in convincing Mogensen to let him fly over from the UK for a meeting the next day.\n“This in spite of him saying that his wife was giving birth that evening,” said Pillai, with an embarrassed chuckle at the memory of his insistence. “The moment I landed, I took a taxi to his store, tried the products, thought they were great, and talked to him for about an hour. Then he said. ‘I gotta go. My wife’s going into labour soon.’ My first trip to Copenhagen literally lasted three hours.”\nMore visits and many conversations later, Leckerbaer’s first overseas store opened in Isetan Scotts on July 23. “We wanted to take time and make sure we did it properly,” said Pillai. “We looked at everything from sourcing ingredients to having people trained in Copenhagen before coming back to Singapore to set up the kitchen.”\nPillai’s north star for partnerships is simple: Like-minded owners fully involved in the business. Quality products. Social media champions. This includes New York confectionary chain Lady M, whose mille crepe cakes has defined chi-chi teatime treats since its 2013 opening, and Los Angeles gothic-inspired soft-serve ice-cream Little Damage that was launched last year.\nThe Luke’s Lobster deal took a year from talks to signatures, and the outlet is targeted to open next to Leckerbaer this month. Pillai flew to Maine at least three times to get acquainted with owner Luke Holden and his team.\n“We got to know them as people, they came over as well, and we talked about each other’s plans for the business and how we see it growing. That’s where we get the feeling we’ve aligned vision and focus for what we want to do.\n“Luke’s company is fully vertically integrated, which tells me that cost is always going to be under control. They control every aspect of their business, from the piers and the processing facilities to the packaging, except the fishermen. It tells me that these guys believe in what they’re doing, and it helps a lot as we’re also a family business. They understand the problems we face and how personally invested we are.”\nPillai said: “When we first started out, we tried to create our own concepts.\xa0Then we started thinking how much it was going to cost us to scale and market them and if it’s worth the effort, or do we take a proven concept and help them spread the brand out. We went with the latter.”\nHis strategy is to replicate the same quality and experience that well-travelled Singaporeans would get at these overseas F&B outlets, and accentuate familiar local tastes. After stabilising the brand in Singapore, the next step is to take it to the Southeast Asia region.\nPillai said: “With Leckerbaer, it's bringing back the blue-tin butter cookies which we all know while growing up, but with better quality products and ingredients.\n“With Luke’s, it’s bringing great seafood that all Singaporeans love. I’ve seen the facilities for Luke’s Lobsters. The lobsters are flash frozen so you’re eating it as if it was caught and cooked right on the spot. And the crabs too, their sweetness is fantastic. We're not trying to reinvent the wheel, just taking things that we know the local market can accept, and upping the game on it by bringing better quality products.”\nWith a discerning consumer base and a competitive F&B landscape riddled with thin margin and high rentals and labour costs, Pillai says that it is all about running a very precise business where costs are kept in check.\n“If that formula and that brand can work in Singapore, we generally feel very confident to bring it around the region. What we’re selling is a combination of complementing brand experiences with which we can spread expansion costs, instead of one brand bearing the burden,” he added.\nThe concept of dining within a retail mall is also a first for Pillai. “We’ve never done it but we like the idea of being able to bring different customer experiences into different parts of a mall to spice it up. We’re confident it will do very well.”\nNevertheless, the entrepreneurship road has its potholes with COVID-19 adding another one.\nThe Little Damage outlet at Haji Lane remains closed, as tourist footfall in the area, which it mainly depends on, has dropped drastically. When dining-in wasn’t allowed during the circuit breaker, Pillai made sure that Lady M was on delivery platforms within a few days. The team has also been busy strengthening its back-end systems and streamlining its processes for greater efficiency. Lady M currently has its own central kitchen while the rest of the brands share another.\n\n\n Say hello to this gorgeous cake wheel ��\u2060 You can now order 7 slices of your favourite flavours and get complimentary delivery right to your doorstep.

It reinforced his belief that the traditional franchise model no longer worked, and that a mutual understanding between partners was essential.\n“With changing times, business models must change. The people behind the brand are also very important. They need to have an understanding of the problems we face in running a business. A key part of it is costs. If you’re not helping us to keep our costs down, then it’s never going to work.”\nThat mistake has evidently not stopped Pillai from an expansion blitz since.\nA fourth new-to-market brand is targeted to land by year-end, although details are still under wraps. Pillai said: “I can tell you that it’s from the US and it will be in the confectionary space, though not so much on the sweet side. It will be entrepreneur-owned, like Leckerbaer.”\nWatch this space for updates.\n“With changing times, business models must change. The people behind the brand are also very important. They need to have an understanding of the problems we face in running a business.” – Vijay K.

      Are canned foods good for you?
  </h1>, 'text': ""Invented by Frenchman Nicolas Appert in 1809, canning as a method of preservation was based on the idea that the presence of air led to food spoilage. The Parisian chef first tested his hypothesis by tightly sealing items like soups, juices, vegetables and even dairy products in glass jars, before subjecting the foods to heat by placing the jars in boiling water.\nThe heat killed the microorganisms sealed within the jars and the vacuum stopped bacteria growth, thus preserving the food.\xa0The glass jar was soon replaced by tin cans in 1810 by Peter Durand – a big step towards the modern cans that we still use today.\nWith canned foods, there is no need to preserve food through older techniques such as salting or drying, which may compromise taste and texture, and it is certainly a lot more convenient.\nTHE NUTRITIONAL BENEFITS OF CANNED FOOD\nFood producers sometimes add\xa0preservatives and food colouring to enhance ingredients visually, as well as a generous amount of sodium in a bid to improve flavour.\nBut not all canned foods are made the same.\xa0Tomatoes and other products that contain the antioxidant lycopene are examples of foods that benefit from being canned. Previous studies have shown that the antioxidant is more easily absorbed by the body after processing. Similarly, canned fruits and vegetables high in vitamin A and carotenes like corn perform just as well after the canning process.\nAnother good performer is fatty fish. These include sardines, mackerel, tuna and salmon. These fish are sources of omega-3 fatty acids – an essential fat that cannot be produced by the human body and helps to maintain good blood cholesterol, heart and brain health.\nIt is important to note that supplements that provide omega-3 fatty acids, such as fish oil capsules, are not a substitute for a healthy meal, as suggested by the Ministry of Health.\nNatural food forms such as fresh or canned fish are generally the preferred choice when it comes to nutrition. Thankfully, according to data from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), fresh and canned fish have comparable amounts of omega-3 fatty acids.\nWhat makes canned food a simpler alternative as well is the fact that fatty fish such as sardines, mackerel and tuna are not as widely available in markets year-round. Canned fish makes it easier for consumers to purchase first before consuming later on, not having to worry about how fresh the fish will be or if they're preparing it correctly.\xa0Plus it is also typically more affordable compared to fresh fish when measured in net edible weight.\xa0\nMany organisations now recognise that whether food is fresh, frozen or dried, moderation is key. Just remember to avoid high levels of sodium, sugar or trans-fats in the ingredients list, and keep a lookout for the Healthier Choice symbol as a quick guide.\xa0According to the Singapore Food Agency, food brands need to declare the complete list of ingredients and additives present.\xa0\nYOUR AYAM BRAND FAVOURITES JUST GOT EVEN BETTER\nLong known for its canned sardine and tuna, Ayam Brand has unveiled its take on Pacific Ocean mackerel or saba, in the form of flakes. Popular for its texture and taste, the fish is\xa0also a good source of healthy fats.\nAccording to Ms Shermin Low, an accredited nutritionist from MyKenzen Nutrition Services, Ayam Brand's canned saba has 50 per cent more omega-3 content than tuna. The information can also be found on the nutrition information panel on its cans.\nAyam Brand's saba flakes come in three flavours. For a more natural taste, the Saba Flakes in Extra Virgin Olive Oil is a great inclusion with plain carbs like rice, noodles or pastas. Saba Mayonnaise is best as a creamy addition to sandwiches and wraps for that flavour boost. For Singaporeans who love a little spice, try the Saba Chilli. Like the popular Tuna Chilli from the brand, it works well with almost anything, including eating it on its own.\nWant to be one of the first to taste these new flavours? Ayam Brand is giving away 2,000 sets of full-sized cans of the Saba Flakes. Claim your free samples of Ayam Brand Saba Flakes today.\n\n"", 'related_topics': ['     food ', '     Ayam Brand ']}"

      What a gut-busting, 15-course lunch at Singapore’s newest Japanese restaurant is like
  </h1>, 'text': 'In pre-pandemic times, enjoying an Edomae sushi meal was a treat in itself. Now, in the new normal, it feels like the ultimate luxury to be able to savour each parcel of fish and rice, deftly and delicately shaped by – not to mention warmed by – the human hand.\nSo it was with great excitement that we took up the invitation to dine at Sushi Kou, an eight-seater omakase restaurant helmed by chef Yoshio Sakuta. The restaurant, located in Holiday Inn Orchard, officially opened on the first day of Phase 2 (Jun 19) after operating exclusively for delivery and takeaway for three weeks prior.\nAdmittedly, there was a little trepidation too. But our fears were unfounded. Would chef have to be gloved up to comply with regulations? (No) Would there be an acrylic barrier separating the dining counter from the preparation area? (No) Would we have to adhere to a strict set of dining rules, lest we offend the culinary gods? (No)\nChef Sakuta, who was most recently head chef at two-Michelin-star Shoukouwa Sushi Restaurant, proved to be relaxed, friendly and casual, traits no doubt owing to his upbringing in Sapporo. His knife skills were top, of course, courtesy of a 20-year career as sushi chef. It was a pleasure watching him wield the blades with such deftness.\nDecked out almost entirely in blond hinoki (Japanese cypress) wood, the bijou space resembled a Hokkaido log cabin – a touch of chef’s homeland. Only two menus are available, for both lunch and dinner: The Aya Menu (10 pieces of sushi plus three dishes; S$380++) or the Kou Menu (10 pieces of sushi and five dishes; S$450++). We were told that there was only one seating per service, to allow chef more time to devote to the preparation.\nAsked about the relatively high cost of the meal, chef replied through an interpreter: “The price might be steep, but what diners get are premium ingredients, ones that are hard to obtain even for restaurants in Japan itself.\xa0We source fresh fish from Toyusu Market [in Tokyo] that is equal to, or better than, the finest sushi restaurants in Japan.\xa0\n“In addition, comparatively across high-end sushi restaurants, many in Singapore start at S$480 to S$500 for dinner, while in Japan the prices range from 25,000 to 40,000 yen, translating to about S$320 to S$500. The cost itself is not an accurate gauge because at Sushi Kou our ingredients are air-flown in, and this incurs shipping costs that we have to take into consideration too.\n“Having said that, we continue to aim to manage at a price similar to that of a high-end sushi restaurant in Japan. We’ve lowered the profit margin to serve high-quality sushi to sushi fans and the discerning gourmands alike, in Singapore.”\nWe were offered the 15-course Kou Menu to sample, and found the meal to be faultless in terms of flavour, texture and presentation. Without going into too much detail on each course – we reserve the pleasure of discovery for you, dear reader – a few key highlights deserve mention.\nOf the five appetisers that were served before the sushi, the Mozuku Seaweed with Vinegar Sauce stood out for its delightful explosion of flavours and textures. There was the rich, umami creaminess from the bafun uni; the crunch from the conch; a herbaceous quality imparted by the shiso flower; the crispness from the junsai (watershield), a water plant from Akita; and the oceanic freshness from the mozuku, a brown seaweed from Okinawa. All these were bound together in a gelatinous, vinegary mixture – slightly reminiscent of – dare we say it, shark’s fin soup.\nThen there was the sushi.\nWe enjoyed chef’s use of a squeeze of lime to accentuate the Marbled Flounder, the juice counterbalancing the oils from the fish beautifully. But then, citrus zest and seafood is always a happy marriage.\nIn the Black Throat Seaperch, freshly grilled fish was served on warm vinegared rice in a bowl, with a small squeeze of lime. We were urged to gently “break up” the fish with a spoon to release its aromatic oils to flavour the rice. The result was as comforting as a warm embrace.\nWhat does chef make of the “burden” of two Michelin stars from his previous post? Can we assume he hopes to repeat his success? “It would be a great honour for Sushi Kou to receive a Michelin star, but my top priority for Sushi Kou, and personally as a chef, is to impart the purest form of joy from tasting the food I plate.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     Singapore ', '     Restaurants ', '     food ', '     gastronomy ', '     Japan ', '     Fine dining ']}"

      Bangkok tourism will recover without Instagram tourists, says one hotelier
  </h1>, 'text': 'If you enjoy dining at a rooftop restaurant alfresco style, you probably have hotelier and F&B visionary Deepak Ohri to thank. In 2003, Ohri introduced a restaurant and bar atop the State Tower, one of Bangkok’s derelict skyscrapers, ultimately popularising the rooftop dining craze that we still see today.\nPromising spectacular food, sublime tipples, and one of the finest views in all of Bangkok, the Sirocco restaurant and Sky Bar soon turned into hotspots, attracting both locals and tourists alike. Sky Bar even had a starring role in Hollywood movie Hangover II.\nIn 2006, Ohri opened the Lebua at State Tower hotel in the building, followed by the all-suite Tower Club at Lebua in 2011. Over the years, several new restaurants and bars were opened in the building, including Asian restaurant Breeze, two Michelin-starred restaurant Mezzaluna,\xa0cocktail bar Distil, and champagne bar Flute.\nWith an array of F&B establishments under one roof, collectively known as The Dome at Lebua, the building garnered the reputation as “the world’s first vertical destination”.\nBut despite its popularity, Lebua was certainly not immune to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. To curb the spread of the coronavirus, Bangkok went into lockdown on Mar 21. By then, local hotels were already struggling,\xa0with international travel halted for the foreseeable future.\nThe second blow came on Mar 26, when restaurants were no longer allowed to serve dine-in patrons. On average, Lebua’s F&B outlets would see 1,600 guests per day. But during the lockdown, business dwindled completely to zero.\nStill, Ohri remained undaunted by the challenges that loomed ahead. When restaurants were ordered to close, Ohri saw the news in a positive light. “That was the need of the hour,” he said. “Every time during a war, to take a step ahead, you need to take a step back. Look at your surroundings, assess the situation, and then move forward. That was exactly what we did.” \xa0\n“Every time during a war, to take a step ahead, you need to take a step back. Look at your surroundings, assess the situation, and then move forward. That was exactly what we did.” – Deepak Ohri\nCHARITY NIGHT OPENING\nThroughout the lockdown in Thailand, Lebua employees were told to\xa0“go home, sleep, rest and look after their health”. “The reason was we didn’t know which direction we were heading,” Ohri explained.\nAlthough business came to a standstill, Lebua has so far managed to retain all of its employees, whereas layoffs have been rife in the hospitality industry. While Ohri understands that it is difficult to retain staff during this time, he still finds this measure rather puzzling.\xa0\n“Employees are the brand and the brand’s protectors. When there is no war, do you fire the armed forces? If you don’t fire the armed forces, why are you firing employees during the pandemic, which is a temporary phase?” the straight-talking CEO questioned.\nLebua sure has a knack for doing things differently. Although restaurants in Bangkok were allowed to reopen from May 3, Lebua was in no rush to welcome dine-in guests once again. In fact, its F&B outlets were only reopened two months later on Jul 3. Ohri justified this decision by explaining that in the luxury business, time is required to reimagine the whole dining experience with new guidelines in place.\nInstead, Ohri had plans to reopen The Dome at Lebua with a bang, in the form of a charity\xa0event. Diners were not charged regular prices on\xa0opening day. Rather, they were invited to pay as they wished, with all proceeds going to five local charities, namely\xa0the Siriraj Foundation for cancer medicine research, The Thai Red Cross Society, The Mirror Foundation, Rama Foundation and Equitable Education Fund.\n\n\n It\'s time to celebrate! We are thrilled to share that Sirocco @siroccobangkok is sold out on our opening night of 3rd July. Thank you all! #lebua #lebuahotelsresorts #lebuaatstatetower #towerclubatlebua #experienceatlebua #bangkok #bangkokhotel #thailand #worldsfirstverticaldestination #hospitality #reopen #siroccobangkok #thedome #finedining #mediterraneanfood\nA post shared by  lebua Hotels and Resorts (@lebuahotelsresorts) on Jul 2, 2020 at 5:01am PDT\nWhen asked why he decided to hold a charity opening, instead of recouping losses sustained during lockdown, Ohri said, “We have done our part by keeping our employees. This will help others in need, even by just a little bit.”\nThe charity element was kept under wraps from diners prior to reopening, and even through the night itself. When guests requested for the final bill, only then were they told that it was a charity night for Lebua. “They could pay whatever they felt like for their meal. But all our guests were very happy with the service and food. They paid the same amount as the actual bill, and some guests even paid extra,” Ohri revealed.\nIn total, Lebua raised THB 421,843 (S$18,482) on opening night, which would be split between the five charities.\nFROM HOTEL TO HOME \nWith the belief\xa0that the pandemic is “30 per cent management of the virus, and 70 per cent management of fear”, Ohri’s team is working towards giving guests the confidence to return back to The Dome, now that its\xa0restaurants and bars have opened again. That’s not to say locals in Bangkok are staying in – Ohri shared that since lifting lockdown, restaurants in the city have been full.\nLebua has since launched a new innovative service\xa0called Hotel To Home, which quite literally brings the luxury hotel experience into guests’ homes. Guests who book the service can enjoy a gourmet chef’s tasting menu, with wine pairing handcrafted by Lebua’s award winning team of chefs, service team, mixologists and sommeliers.\n“Hotel To Home will give customers confidence,” Ohri said. “If we can come to your house, you can come to our place, am I right?”\nSharing more about the experience, Ohri continued, “The experience will be just like staying in a hotel, because guests don’t have to do anything. They are taken care of, the tables are set, and they can have a great meal with great chefs cooking for them. The only thing that is known to them is their surroundings.”\n\n\nGOODBYE, INSTAGRAM TOURISTS \nLooking at how the travel landscape in Bangkok will change post-pandemic, Ohri is certain that a holiday in the city will change for the better. “In the last two years, we saw a great form of tourism emerge, called Instagram tourism. You have two days in the city, you go to three bars, four restaurants, four other hotspots and take many photos,” Ohri shared. “Instagram tourism will be gone,” he believes.\nInstagram tourists visit several different places in a short span of time, but spending per person is not enough to sustain the tourism industry. Now, it\'s the big spenders who will jump start the scene. “In the next two or three years, luxury is going to be king. People will prefer bigger dining halls, and food created by Michelin-starred chefs.”\nOn the latter, Ohri explained that Michelin-starred restaurants emphasise hygiene, sanitation and the art of cooking. “I’m not saying other restaurants don’t do that, don’t get me wrong. But when we are trying to manage diners’ fears, perception becomes reality.”\nWith Instagram tourists gone, serious diners will come, Ohri predicts. “These are diners who would like to enjoy the experience. They will sit at the table and have a three, four-hour meal. People are going to go for space. And when you have space, you feel comfortable. When you feel comfortable, conversation will flow and your spending will go up. That’s how things will work.”\nTHAILAND’S LUXURY PUSH \nOhri’s strategy to target serious spenders is in line with the Thai government’s push to prioritise luxury travel moving forward. Even before the pandemic began, Thailand has long harboured dreams of becoming a high-end tourism destination, shedding its image as a backpacker hotspot.\xa0\nThough tourism is targeted at domestic travellers for now, the\xa0country’s strategy to reopen its borders involves creating “travel bubbles”, where international tourists from selected countries in the Asia-Pacific with low coronavirus risk are allowed to enter the country. Its marketing strategy seeks to attract big spenders in the region, keen to experience an exclusive holiday with privacy and safe\xa0distancing in place.\nOhri terms spending of\xa0these domestic travellers and future international tourists as “appropriate spending”, sharing his distaste for the term “revenge spending”. “During this pandemic, you have not gone out of the house. Suddenly you get the chance to go out, and your spending is called \'revenge spending\'. What are you taking revenge on? It’s a very strange term,” the opinionated hotelier lamented.\n“This is a form of spending they have been waiting for, an experience they have been waiting for. That’s why it will be an appropriate spending,"" he said.\xa0\n“During this pandemic, you have not gone out of the house. Suddenly you get the chance to go out, and your spending is called \'revenge spending\'. What are you taking revenge on?""\xa0– Deepak Ohri\n', 'related_topics': ['     Bangkok ', '     Travel ', '     gastronomy ', '     food ', '     tourism ', '     Thailand ', '     Opinions ', '     Places & Attractions ']}"

      In a city famous for pork and poultry, why are Hong Kongers eating so much beef?
  </h1>, 'text': 'In the 2019 table of global beef consumption per head of population, the countries in the top two spots were perhaps predictable: Argentina and Uruguay. They\'re famed for their beef production on vast ranches, as well as their history of cooking beef over asador grills.\nIn third place, however, came Hong Kong, with each citizen eating an astonishing 51.7 kg of beef per year. That\'s the equivalent of almost two Big Macs per person, per day – every day.\n\n\nBeating countries like the US and Australia is some feat, especially when the SAR is better known for seafood consumption. All of which begs the questions of how and why beef has become such a huge part of the diet.\nThere are, of course, sceptics who doubt the numbers. Some say that much of the beef is actually smuggled across the border to the Chinese mainland, where prices are higher and demand greater.\nBut there\'s no doubting the overall trend in stratospheric growth in consumption: Back in 2001 when China joined the World Trade Organization, the total value of its meat imports was only 15 per cent of the equivalent number in the US. Just 15 years later, however, they had already overtaken the U.S.\n\n\nEating beef was once so rare in China that back in the 18th century, if you looked for a recipe you\'d find it listed alongside palm civet and other “exotic” ingredients. But as Hong Kong\'s post-war economy developed and living standards improved, it quickly found favour among local diners. A large expatriate population who were familiar with eating beef, not to mention the city\'s status as a key global trading hub, both ensured that it grew in popularity to rival the traditionally most popular meat, pork.\nThere is no denying, however, that beef-eating habits have substantially evolved over the last few decades – and especially so in the last ten years. The city has seen a rise in high-end beef specialists and standalone steak restaurants, leaving some famed traditional American steakhouse chains struggling to keep up.\nJason Lo is Managing Director of Waves Pacific, a company he founded in 2002 to supply the city\'s restaurants – and recently individual customers – with high-end produce, from truffles to caviar and some of the world\'s finest beef, of which he sells between eight to ten tonnes per month.\n""Hong Kong diners are now quite knowledgeable about the origins of the beef, as people are well-travelled and have developed more sophisticated palates. But Hong Kong has always been a big beef city and it has greatly progressed in scope and variety.\n“Back when I started, the only ‘premium’ beef was from the US and Japan. Australian beef was thought of as sub-standard. We spent the first few years changing that perception with Australian Wagyu beef, and today, Mayura Station and WX by Rangers Valley are our flagship brands.""\nWith growing beef appreciation and knowledge, so the variety of cuts on offer has grown.\n""Once we got a foothold, we then started to push the ‘secondary cuts’,” Lo added. “At the time, most restaurants only used the loin cuts such as striploins, ribeyes and tenderloins. When I was in Australia I tried the cheeks and decided to bring those in as well, then one of the first secondary cuts we introduced was the Wagyu onglet. I remember bringing it to one of our early French clients and how excited he was.""\nUltimately, Lo is bullish – excuse the pun – about the future of beef in Hong Kong.\nHe said: ”The Hong Kong restaurant market is already quite crowded, but there is always room for someone to bring in something new and approachable. Even with the rise of plant-based foods, demand has remained strong, maybe because we work with producers who are mindful of the way they produce their beef.\n“In all the hoopla, one of the things that gets lost is that quality meat is the product of high animal welfare and good practices. Industrialised food production, whether it’s meat or soy or anything, is something we all need to be mindful of.”\n""Hong Kong people love high-end Japanese beef because wagyu is a brand like Rolex or eating caviar, so it\'s perceived as a luxury item. It\'s especially popular now as people who would normally go to Japan to eat beef can\'t travel, so they\'re looking for outlets to get their fix.\n“We love to educate people about the different types, how Miyazaki is different from Kagoshima, Kobe and Ozaki. At the same time we want Yakinikumafia to introduce new diners to wagyu as there\'s a new generation of producers and suppliers who want to bring it out to the world through more casual places.""\nHis restaurant group gets through more than a tonne of beef a month, always imported fresh, never frozen, with prime and second cuts distributed to different eateries. Dinner at Wagyumafia can run to HK$4,000 per person (S$720) without drinks, but after a very tough few months for the industry, business is back.\n""Our consumption is higher than before and we\'re one of the largest importers of Japanese wagyu. It\'s both luxurious and scarce so we don\'t think appetite will go down. It\'s also very versatile and that\'s why customers keep coming back – we even started a dim sum night featuring high-end wagyu in siu mai, baos, spring rolls and more.”\nMario Paecke is Chef de Cuisine at SOMM at the Landmark Mandarin Oriental. One of his signature dishes is a beef tartare, but in line with the luxurious offerings across the five-star property, it is taken up a level.\n""We all love a good steak tartare, but it would be too obvious just to serve it the classical way. At SOMM, as at Amber, there will always be a little twist, so we use the very best French techniques, amazing grass-fed beef from France by Alexandre Polmard seasoned with ingredients from Japan. The mild heat of the binchotan grilled green chillies and the elegant fragrance of green shiso are a perfect match without \xa0losing the flavour of the beef.\n“The tartare is an elegant match with the huge varieties of wines & sakes by the glass served in SOMM and you can go in various directions depending how adventurous you are.”\nAs to the key question regarding how beef compares in popularity with other meats on the menu, Paecke offered: ""Beef remains very popular in Hong Kong and there\'s no doubt it\'s the favourite meat in a protein-heavy city. The taste of beef has evolved considerably over the years and is certainly more sophisticated.\n“We also recognise that hunger for beef creates problems with the environment, hence we only focus on grass-fed beef and beef that has been ethically raised. We select the best possible choices that have less impact on our environment and are still exceptional products.""\nAlthough not every restaurateur or consumer is as mindful of the bigger sustainability picture as Paecke, Lo and Li, with people like them leading the charge, it seems that beef still has a very bright future in the Fragrant Harbour.\n""Beef remains very popular in Hong Kong and there\'s no doubt it\'s the favourite meat in a protein-heavy city.” – Mario Paecke\n', 'related_topics': ['     Hong Kong ', '     China ', '     food ', '     Restaurants ', '     F&B ', '     Fine dining ']}"

      Commentary: From farmers to supermarket clerks, a new kind of essential worker has emerged
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Scenes of people standing at their balconies, clapping for frontline medical workers, were mirrored in many cities across the globe during COVID-19.\nWhile the pandemic has rightfully thrust healthcare workers into the spotlight, a new kind of essential worker has also emerged.\xa0\nFrom supermarket clerks and food delivery riders to those at the very heart of the food value chain, farmers – the people who ensure that food continues to reach our tables - have been among the unsung heroes of this pandemic.\nIn April, as COVID-19 spread to much of the world, the United Nations World Food Programme Executive Director David Beasley warned of a looming hunger pandemic.\n“There are a further 135 million people facing crisis levels of hunger or worse ... But now the World Food Programme analysis shows that, due to the coronavirus, an additional 130 million people could be pushed to the brink of starvation by the end of 2020. That’s a total of 265 million people.” he said in a virtual address to the United Nations Security Council.\nThe worst damage will be felt in the low-income countries least equipped to deal with the fallout from the pandemic.\nFor many of us, COVID-19 has made the concept of food security a reality for the first time. In a world where 60 per cent of the population has been under lockdown, emerging only to buy food, empty supermarket shelves have been an unnerving sight.\nThe exemption of agriculture from lockdown measures in countries across Asia Pacific helped to reduce the disruption to our food value chain, bringing to light the integral role farmers play in safeguarding our food security.\nAs we restart our economies, now is the time to ask ourselves: What more can we do for our farmers to build their resilience and ensure the continued supply of safe, nutritious and affordable food for all?\xa0\nTHE IMPORTANCE OF SMALLHOLDER FARMERS\nUnlike other regions, the main food providers in Asia Pacific are our 435 million smallholder farms – the majority of which have less than two hectares of land, compared to an average 179 hectares in the United States and 16 hectares in Europe - and often have limited access to newer technologies.\xa0\nThese smallholders produce up to 80 per cent of the food consumed in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, making our farmers producers to the world.\nWith Asia Pacific’s population is expected to hit 5.2 billion by 2050, maximising productivity amongst smallholders whilst simultaneously conserving resources and preserving the land is critical to ensure that we all have enough food in the future.\nThis is easier said than done. COVID-19 is a stark reminder of how vulnerable the agricultural industry is to new threats.\nBehind the scenes, the lockdown induced labour shortages, limited transportation and restricted distribution as markets, restaurants and other food channels shut their doors. This led to colossal amounts of wasted produce, threatening the livelihood of millions of smallholders in the region.\nThe pandemic also puts greater strain on the long-term challenges facing farming communities. Rapid urbanisation over the last 30 years has resulted in depleting arable land and a shrinking agricultural workforce, as younger generations flock to Asia’s cities.\nA surge in the long-term demand for food clashes with poor agricultural infrastructure and low economies of scale – as small-scale farmers are unable to maximise productivity - preventing smallholders from accessing profitable markets.\nAll this falls against the backdrop of the climate crisis as increasingly erratic and extreme weather in the region can wipe out entire crop yields in a matter of hours.\nNow more than ever, farmers are finding themselves in greater need of support to weather the COVID-19 storm.\nTARGETED POLICIES\xa0AND STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS\nRecognising the urgent need to address the gaps exposed by the pandemic, governments in countries, including Indonesia and India, are revealing bold agricultural reforms to liberalise\xa0the sector.\nIn Indonesia, the government has dedicated around 6 million ha\xa0of land to produce basic food products such as rice, livestock and corn, while India is considering a “one nation, one market” system that will free farmers from tight market zones that limit the seamless transaction of goods.\nAs we rebuild the “new normal”, the decisions we make now have the potential to transform the way we feed the world in the future – to accelerate progress towards a more responsible food system which is kinder to our environment, whilst enabling farmers to flourish.\nBy focusing these efforts on the root causes of food insecurity – those that are having a direct and detrimental impact on our farmers – we can help them to protect against existing challenges and future threats to enhance levels of food security across the region.\xa0\nA good place to start is the Global Food Security Index. Developed by the Economist Intelligence Unit\xa0and supported by the Corteva Agriscience, the index is an in-depth study of the state of food systems around the world.\xa0\nBy identifying the underlying factors which threaten food security at a country-level, the index is a tool to inform the practical steps we should take to strengthen the value chain.\nLast year’s Index found several areas of focus for the region to boost the productivity and profitability of smallholders, and consequently, to strengthen our regional food security.\nFirst, improving access to farm financing programs. Access to credit is instrumental in ensuring that farmers can obtain the best possible solutions to improve the quality and quantity of their crops.\nThe Index also calls for a significant boost in public sector investments in agricultural R&D, especially in countries such as India and China, where the industry has some of the lowest amounts of public investments in Asia Pacific, compared to countries such as Singapore and South Korea who are ranked first and fourth globally for investments into agricultural R&D.\nGovernment investment in high-quality seeds and inputs, greener technologies and low energy- or water- intensive farming methods, such as direct-seeded rice systems, can drive the implementation of sustainable practices on a national scale.\nWidening the adoption of agritech will also provide greater market access and improve productivity for smallholders. Digital solutions – which could allow farmers to streamline operations or connect directly to customers through digital platforms at low cost – can democratise the market for smallholders.\nOUR SHARED RESPONSIBILITY FOR FOOD SECURITY\nIt is the responsibility of stakeholders across the value chain to drive sustainable progress in these areas – to increase the productivity, incomes and sustainable farming practices of smallholder farmers to build the resilience of our global food system.\nLeveraging the resources and expertise of both the public and private sectors, educational programs in countries can equip farmers with critical know-how on seed and land preparation, marketing, financial management and new information on crop protection technologies.\nThese efforts will help farmers embed sustainability into their everyday work, increasing yield stability, optimising inputs, and protect against climate threats.\nWhilst health and economic support remain the world’s current top priority, our region’s smallholders need us to make smart investments now, so they can continue to feed our population for generations to come.\nThe hands that feed us need practical, strategic initiatives to prepare them for the food security challenges of the future.\nPeter Ford is\xa0President, Asia Pacific, Corteva Agriscience.\n', 'related_topics': ['     food ', '     agriculture ', '     COVID-19 ']}"

      Evolving in crisis: Why Chope is more than a restaurant reservation platform 
  </h1>, 'text': 'When the COVID-19 pandemic triggered a lockdown in Singapore, it spelled trouble for the survival of several businesses. For companies such as Chope, whose business largely depends on people going out, it brought about an existential crisis.\xa0\n“I still remember the day\xa0dining out was no longer allowed. We asked ourselves, what do we do? For a split second, you question your existence,” said Dinesh Balasingam, Chief Business Officer (CBO) of Chope and member of the founding team.\nBut out of crisis comes opportunity – something the nine-year-old company, which has footprints in Singapore, Bali, Jakarta, Bangkok, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Phuket, knows all too well. In order to survive, the company\xa0had to pivot its business. “It was kind of a make or break situation. We got everything taken away from us, including our ability to function. So in that moment, we had to explore various ways to continue supporting our staff and partner restaurants,” Balasingam shared.\n“Our CEO Arrif Ziaudeen likes to say, ‘Don’t waste a crisis’. I think that was the headspace we were all in,” he continued.\nFROM DINING OUT TO DINING IN \nWith the ban on dining out forcing Chope to quickly switch its gears, the company rolled out a delivery service, named Chope On Delivery, in just a matter of days. “As a team, our mission and ethos has always been about creating memorable experiences through dining out,” Balasingam said. “But in times like this, we wanted to see how we could still spread joy to people at home.”\nChope partnered with SMRT and Gojek to launch the service, whose drivers came on board as transport providers. “We knew that in a lot of ways, we were in the same boat and potentially suffering from the effects of this. Because with less people going out, there is less demand for these drivers. So what will they do, and how could they earn?” Balasingam opined.\nAlthough the food delivery landscape is very much dominated by incumbent players such as Grab, Deliveroo and Food Panda, Chope found a niche in the market. “Grab does a lot of bubble tea, McDonalds, a lot of fast food,” Balasingam said. But a survey Chope conducted in May found that 42 per cent of restaurants in Singapore still did not offer delivery.\nWith delivery being the only source of income for the F&B industry, Chope managed to on-board mid- to high-end eateries onto the platform, including Michelin-starred restaurants Odette and Cheek\xa0Bistro.\xa0\nIn addition, chef Rishi Naleendra of Cheek Bistro\xa0had been planning to open Kotuwa, a new Sri Lankan restaurant. Similarly, chef LG Han of Labyrinth intended to launch Miss Vanda, a casual eatery arm. But the pandemic forced both chefs to change their menus to be more delivery-friendly, available for order on Chope, amongst other platforms.\nTo set itself apart from existing players, Chope offered islandwide delivery for all its partner restaurants, as well as the ability to make multiple orders from different restaurants in a single booking.\xa0\nWhen asked if Chope was late to the food delivery game, Balasingam shrugged it off. “Whether late to the game or not, I think we were just focused on the time. In that moment, what could we do that would make sense? We were not thinking about competing with Grab or Deliveroo. It was about empowering restaurants and addressing a need,” he stressed.\n“Whether late to the game or not, I think we were just focused on the time. In that moment, what could we do that would make sense?""\xa0– Dinesh Balasingam\n\n\nA GUIDING LIGHT FOR RESTAURANTS\nAlthough Singapore is now well into Phase 2 of reopening, Chope On Delivery is here to stay, at least for the time being. Balasingam admits that a new challenge awaits in terms of the scalability of the service, and whether Chope can sustain it in the long term.\nThus, while the company found a way to cope during circuit breaker, the resumption of dining out came as good news to the team. As Balasingam put it, “We know what we do best, what we spent the last nine years mastering.”\nWith restaurants attempting to navigate the new regulations, Chope found itself in a unique position to be able to guide the industry. It launched the COVID-19 Restaurant Reopening Playbook, which seeks to help restaurants navigate their reopening strategies, addressing concerns that restaurants and diners may have, and recommending best practices and checklists for F&B establishments operating in Singapore.\n“We know what we do best, what we spent the last nine years mastering.” – Dinesh Balasingam\nIt also launched ChopeSafe, a suite of tech products that help restaurants overcome new challenges. For example, the ChopeBook solution allows restaurants to change their floorplans and turn tables effectively during busy periods. ChopeQueues allows diners to join a virtual queue, reducing the need for them to wait in a physical line. Through ChopeSafe, restaurants can also keep an accurate record of diners for contact tracing purposes.\n“It was split two ways in terms of what we were trying to achieve. One was to empower restaurants, and the other was to educate the public on how they can go out and safely enjoy dining at restaurants again,” Balasingam explained.\nPrior to Phase 2, Chope had also launched a white paper detailing COVID-19’s impact on the industry. “We put this together for people to understand a bit more about the industry and what it was going through. This way, they will know how to behave. For example, understanding the importance of a no-show is huge. Sometimes people make reservations and don’t show up. But it actually has detrimental effects,” Balasingam said.\nBut while Chope users can make bookings on the platform once again, for the moment, they are unable to reap the benefits of ChopePerks, the company’s loyalty programme which rewards frequent users with points that can be redeemed for discount codes or other lifestyle perks.\nIn April, the company announced that it was temporarily suspending redemptions, a move Balasingam understands would be unpopular amongst users. Explaining the rationale behind the move, Balasingam shared that it was a matter of being a responsible company. “It was two pronged. One side was about ourselves, to be honest, and the other was about restaurants. When restaurants are suffering, their primary focus isn’t about giving discounts.”\n“On our side, loyalty programmes, only make sense if there is business and action going and you want to reward people for making purchases. In a time of a pandemic, you have a responsibility to your team to spot cost-saving areas that can be paused for the moment,” he continued.\nWhat users may find difficult to stomach is the fact that redemptions have been suspended till November, even though dining out has since resumed. But Balasingam assured, “That’s the timeline we put out there because we really had no idea how the situation would change. We always like to under-promise, over-deliver. So it might come back sooner than November.”\nSHAPING THE F&B INDUSTRY\nMoving forward from pandemic times, Chope hopes to play a bigger role in shaping the F&B industry, which Balasingam believes has come a long way in terms of diversity and digitalisation.\n“When restaurants were opening years back, the only technology they thought about was a Point-of-Sale system, where you put in an order and it feeds to the kitchen. Now we have so many groups of restaurants coming to us for a table management system, or queue management system.”\nAnd although Balasingam admits the diversity of F&B offerings here is “not enough” yet, he shared that it was heartening to see more female chefs in the industry, and more local chefs helming Michelin-starred restaurants. The fact that Singapore was chosen as a host country for the World’s 50 Best Restaurants awards in 2018 is also testament to its reputation as a culinary destination.\n“We used to be known only for our hawker and street food, but now when people think of the top restaurants in the world, they think of Odette, or Les Amis, and that’s very exciting,” he quipped.\nAs the F&B scene grows, Chope hopes to be more involved in industry conversations. The team has started holding webinars for restaurants to help them understand diners and subsequently, how to better operate their establishments, something they hope to continue.\n""[Singapore] used to be known only for our hawker and street food, but now when people think of the top restaurants in the world, they think of Odette, or Les Amis, and that’s very exciting.""\xa0– Dinesh Balasingam\nOn the flipside, Chope also hopes to use its platform to help educate diners on some of the struggles the industry faces. “When this pandemic hit, a lot of people realised that restaurants only have enough cash flow to last them two or three months. Why is that the case? Is it because no-shows are a big part of the industry? How can we reduce that, and how can we educate people to be more responsible?” Balasingam illustrated.\n\n\n“We’ve been actively trying to move away from being known specifically as a restaurant reservation platform,” he added. “We want to be a part of the entire dining journey. We help diners discover their favourite restaurants. They might not book it today, but they can learn what their options are, and how to get better value for money.”\n“So whether it’s through our reservation platform, through\xa0our deals, or our delivery service, we want to be that go-to whenever people think of dining,” Balasingam concluded.\n', 'related_topics': ['     dining ', '     Restaurants ', '     food ', '     Singapore ', '     Profiles ']}"

      Why are so many restaurants opening in Hong Kong? And why are they full?
  </h1>, 'text': ""The neon reflections and towering cityscape of Hong Kong's iconic Victoria harbour are a draw for diners on the terrace of CHAAT at The Rosewood Hotel. More importantly, they’ve come for the refined, modern Indian Cuisine from chef Manav Tuli, and can count themselves fortunate to have secured a booking. The 90-seat restaurant is already fully booked up – a full three months ahead.\nIn any scenario this would be an enviable position, but in a city racked by ongoing protests against a highly controversial new national security law, not to mention the small matter of coronavirus, it's remarkable.\nTuli, who joined CHAAT from London's one Michelin-starred Tamarind restaurant, explained the difference as he sees it between the two great dining cities.\n“The market in Hong Kong is more competitive than in London. The general public here eats out a lot more than people in the UK, so Hong Kong people know their food very well, are educated in terms of the what and how to eat.\n“At the same time people are very open to try new things, new cuisines. We have a good mix of local Hong Kong guests, the Indian community and the expatriate community, which puts us in a good sweet spot for a mix of clientele touching all walks of life.”\nIn the first quarter of last year, total receipts for the city's restaurants and bars was just north of US$400 million (S$557 million), but this year, with March visitor arrivals down 98.6 per cent compared to last, these figures had plummeted by more than a third – with Q2 figures set to be much, much worse.\nEstimates suggest that more than 1,250 restaurants have already shuttered for good, from Michelin-starred dining by Alain Ducasse at Rech, all of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants in the city and even old stalwarts like Jumbo, a huge floating restaurant down in Aberdeen Harbour.\nYet despite this grim environment, restaurants continue to open at a healthy rate – and pack in the diners.\n“Hong Kong's vibrancy will never die… People always want something new, something delicious, something to line up for. It's the nature of the culture here and that's why it's so amazing.” – Lindsay Jang\nSince 2011, Yardbird Hong Kong have been known for their delicious yakitori chicken, no reservations and no service charge, a combination which continue to make them one of the city's hottest food destinations.\nTheir renown – a visit there is a rite of passage for any foreign chef visiting Hong Kong – helped make them a natural target for BaseHall, a new multi-concept food hall that has just launched in the heart of the city's Central district.\nThe BaseHall venue was rocking on our visit, packed to the rafters with diners and drinkers, while a DJ spun and one of the city's most impressive lighting installations illuminated the throng.\n\n\nA post shared by BaseHall. (@basehallhk)\nAlongside nine other outlets celebrating Hong Kong's\xa0homegrown culinary talent, Yardbird Hong Kong launched Roti Tori, a rotisserie chicken specialist. Yardbird Hong Kong's co-founder Lindsay Jang explained why they decided to open, despite such a challenging environment.\n“Hong Kong's vibrancy will never die – it may be paused at times – but I believe that this is one of the world's most food-forward cities. People always want something new, something delicious, something to line up for. It's the nature of the culture here and that's why it's so amazing.”\nAs for bringing in diners, she explained that footfall “...has exceeded far beyond our expectations. I hope that we can make up for the business we lost earlier in the year and that may happen because everyone is usually traveling – including myself. It's been a silver lining to be grounded with everyone and focus; we're taking advantage of that.”\nUltimately, Jang remained optimistic about the resilience and health of the Hong Kong dining scene in the longer term.\n“My answer would have been different if you asked me in February, but I've witnessed agility, flexibility, hard work, and commitment to figuring out solutions to new problems we never imagined we'd face – and that gives me a lot of hope. If people continue to rally and work together in a positive way, I believe we'll get through this.”\nBalbi has just opened the fine dining spot Ando, a restaurant where classical technique meets Japanese produce, exquisite plating and a thread of deliciousness in every course on the tasting menu. The affable Argentinian smiled as he responds to our question, namely whether it's a brave time to be launching a restaurant?\n“It definitely is, but at the same time, does the perfect time even exist? There will always be challenges and it all depends on how you look at it, I really believe that when you have a goal and you are 100 per cent committed to it, all the adversities can become a strength. We are very lucky and humbled to be able to do this and we look forward to the future in a very respectful way.”\nDespite the unthinkable double whammy of the protests and coronavirus, Balbi is confident that there is still a demand from customers for new places to eat.\n“Regardless of the situation, I feel that in Hong Kong, the curiosity and will to explore new places hasn't changed at all. People are truly passionate about dining and it is beautiful to see that when things get really hard, they are always willing to go out to support their favourites places – and to also discover new ones.”\nIt takes an impressively optimistic mindset to accentuate the positives at a time when restaurants are suffering like never before, but the 32-year-old explained that he still sees a silver lining in the current situation.\n“People are rediscovering local places, supporting their favourite local chefs and restaurants even more than before and that is always a very good thing for the local industry. I hope that when travelling is allowed again this new practice can continue as well.\n“When I talk to chef friends in Hong Kong, I'm very happy to hear that all of them are very busy. But at the same time, we have to be conscious and respectful to our other colleagues all around the world that cannot work at the moment and support them as much as possible.”\nThe final word goes to Syed Asim Hussain of Black Sheep Restaurants, a group which has taken the city's dining scene by storm in recent years, with a string of funked-up eateries that bridge cuisine, music, service and atmosphere to compelling effect.\nTheir latest venture is Crown Super Deluxe, a shamelessly retro teppanyaki spot in the city's nightlife district of Lan Kwai Fong. Clearly a lot of money has been spent in the launch, the obvious question is whether he ever considered pulling the project.\n“Of course it was a significant financial investment, but also a substantial emotional investment. We are a little bit romantic about our work, and teppanyaki is something that we have been dreaming of doing for a very long time.\n“We were not going to let the pandemic get in the way of something we truly wanted to express from a creative standpoint. I am a big believer that restaurants are part of a city’s gloss and that they are going to be part of our comeback story. We intend to be part of that story.”\n“Restaurants are such a vital part of the social fabric of city life, especially international and dense cities like Hong Kong. They are almost an extension, both metaphorically and literally, of your home.\n“As… things started to normalise, Black Sheep Restaurants has felt a rush of people that want to come back out and support us. It has been four, almost five, really difficult quarters financially speaking and, as the English say, a swallow doesn’t make a summer, we have a long way to go. While we need to have several good nights still, things are looking up.”\nBusiness looking up is a refrain that has been heard from other chefs across the city in the past few weeks, as diners feel more confident and comfortable venturing out.\nWith a population still basically unable to travel abroad – a mandatory two-week quarantine applies to all on arrival in Hong Kong – the feeling is that this summer could be a bumper one for drinking and dining, with people keen to have fun wherever they can.\nMore broadly, Hussain stressed that the city's DNA is key to new restaurants opening – and staying open.“Hong Kong is an energetic, aspirational city, where people are not afraid to try new things or cuisines. We believe in the Hong Kong story – and in our own story. We are optimistic that there is going to be the demand for interesting work that is executed at a high level. We can now see that the predictions about the demise of restaurants was overstated, bricks-and-mortar restaurants are here to stay.”\nThe numbers – and the dining public – would seem to suggest that he's right.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Hong Kong ', '     Restaurants ', '     food ', '     gastronomy ', '     Pandemic ', '     F&B ', '     Fine dining ']}"

      Definitively Chinese, not Chinois: The new generation of Chinese restaurants
  </h1>, 'text': 'Chinese restaurants have long been a constant in our culinary scene. Originally the result of industrious emigres hungry for a taste of home, today’s Chinese restaurants are about escapism and hedonism, tempered with a touch of newfound restraint.\nThe latest breed of them to hit our shores are more thoughtfully considered reboots of ambitious club-restaurants from a decade ago. Remember the now-shuttered Chinoiserie-themed establishments of the early Noughties, invariably appointed with lacquered bird cages and a Buddha bust or six?\nToday, that sense of aesthetic has been tamped down, refined and, more aptly, brought back to its roots with touches like modern artworks by Chinese artists and contemporary furnishings from the motherland.\xa0 \xa0\nClub-style dining has given way to relaxed lounge-style experiences, with high-concept cocktails and jazz performances serving as more palatable bedfellows for the food. The food, meanwhile, has gone through a revolution of its own – no longer fusion nor confusion, but Chinese food given an update with grounded creativity and techniques.\xa0 \xa0\n\n\nCULINARY APPEAL \nAt Mimi (Chinese for “secret”), which opened last July on the second floor of a historical Southern Chinese-style building in Clarke Quay, chef Sam Chong and executive culinary director Daniel Koh artfully meld tradition with modern cooking techniques to yield intriguing dishes like crisp slivers of Sichuan-style beef jerky anointed with crushed peppercorn and chilli powder.\nChilli crab, meanwhile, gets its post-modern riff as a deconstructed pool of chilli crab sauce and egg whites with crabmeat buttressed by a ring of fried mantou (buns). Particularly in the early evenings, when dusk begins to soften the stark red dining room, there is much to love about Mimi’s classic cocktails and music that filters from the bar below.\nFor excellent live music with equally outstanding food, there is Madame Fan at the NCO Club at South Beach. Created by Hong Kong-born restaurateur Alan Yau, this 50s-cabaret-inspired space features post-modern jukebox performances on Friday and Saturday evenings.\nWhile Yau – who is behind famously successful entertainment restaurants like Hakkasan in London and Nobu in New York – started out creating concepts for the Western market, he now makes it a point to appeal to western audiences without alienating “the indigenous market”.\nThat means the food no longer features pan-Asian elements but instead cleaves close to tradition. To wit, Madame Fan’s signature dishes include a double-boiled four treasure soup with sea cucumber, fish maw, dried scallop and crab meat; and drunken crab rice noodles with 20-year-old Gu Yue Long Shan rice wine.\n\n\nA post shared by Madame Fan (@madamefansg)\n\n\nMODERNITY ROOTED IN TRADITION\nAnother recent import from Hong Kong is Mott 32 at Marina Bay Sands. Like Madame Fan, its approach to regional Chinese cuisine is rooted in time-honoured recipes made with premium ingredients.\nClassic char siew takes the form of barbecued Pluma Iberico pork glazed with Yellow Mountain honey, while Peking ducks are created from specially bred ducks in Malaysia, which undergo a 42-day aging process that enables their skins to develop a crystalline consistency while retaining their flavourful fattiness.\nMott 32’s Art Deco-esque dining room, gilded with accents of emerald and gold, is anchored by an impressive bar whose mixology programme includes an extensive wine collection and cocktails mixed with Asian ingredients like umeshu, yuzu and chrysanthemum.\nEven decades-old stalwarts have re-emerged with a modernist approach to old world glamour. Last August, Grand Shanghai reopened after a major transformation to reveal its new Art Deco-circa-1930s-Shanghai mien, complete with plush velveteen booth seats, magnificent chandeliers and brass-and-mirror accents that may have well been lifted from a Chinese movie set.\nCorrespondingly, the food features grandiose presentations – paper-thin shards of wasabi-glazed crispy duck hanging on an ornately wrought osmanthus syrup sculpture; deep-fried cod shaped like a chrysanthemum perched on a pool of sweet sour sauce; and perfectly pleated Shanghainese dumplings in a deeply flavourful seafood broth.\nEvidently, restaurateurs are banking on the fact that when it comes to offering a new-generation experience, modernity must rest on a foundation of deep tradition. And where else is tradition stronger than in classic dishes that have delighted a people for generations?\n', 'related_topics': ['     Singapore ', '     Restaurants ', '     food ', '     gastronomy ', '     Fine dining ']}"

      Five celebrity chefs in Asia on the places they'll go once travel is back
  </h1>, 'text': 'It\'s a simple premise and one that we\'ve all ruminated on time and again in recent months: Once travel is once again safe and viable, where would be the first foreign destination you\'d venture to? And crucially, what is the first thing you\'d eat there?\nWhile we all have our own answers – mine would be an over-stuffed banh mi in Hoi An, followed by a bowl of the town\'s famed cao lau noodles – five renowned chefs working across Asia reveal their long-awaited dishes and where to get them.\nStarting in Manila, Filipino chef Jordy Navarra has forged a path as one of the country\'s foremost culinary talents at Toyo Eatery. His cuisine celebrates the remarkable, diverse food history of the 7,107 islands he calls home, in a tasting menu that has won public and critical acclaim, including a highly-coveted spot on the list of Asia\'s 50 Best Restaurants.\n""Here in Manila we\'ve had one of the longest lockdowns anywhere, 100 days and counting. As a result my wife and I have had time to go deep into Korean TV dramas, so all we can talk about currently is when we can finally get there as we\'ve never been! I want to try kimchi at the source, all their soy bean ferments and chilli pastes, as well as visit the famed Buddhist monk chef Jeong Kwan in the Chunjinam Hermitage at the Baegyangsa temple.""\n\n\nBut, Navarra added, the one dish he has been missing more than any other is a choice that doubtless many would echo.\n""As far as just one dish is concerned, after lockdown we agree it absolutely has to be sushi, so we\'d head first to Hakkoku in Tokyo where sushiya doesn\'t get fresher from star chef Hiroyuki Sato. I also like the idea of eating raw food, served by people using their bare hands – call it embracing ‘positive bacteria’ to declare that COVID-19 is well and truly over!”\nOne of the most well-known faces in Singapore\'s vibrant culinary scene is Chef Julien Royer at Odette, holder of three Michelin stars and no less than the number one spot in Asia\'s 50 Best Restaurants. Royer also has a restaurant in Hong Kong called Louise, a vibrant spot that the 37-year-old has sorely missed as much as the city itself.\n\n\n""I would definitely sign up for a trip to Hong Kong! First of all, my restaurant Louise that we opened with Yenn Wong and JIA is there and I miss going, cooking there and being with Chef Franckelie Laloum and the team. Then I have many friends in Hong Kong and love to eat out there. One dish is really hard to choose, but if I really have to pick one, it will be the superlative Peking duck from Xin Rong Ji.""\nXin Rong Ji specialises in Taizhou cuisine from Zhejiang Province and their duck is indeed rightly famous, its crispy skin the perfect accompaniment to tender meat.\n""I ate there in January last year while collaborating with Chef Vicky Cheng from VEA. I have some great memories of this dinner, the flavours were really nice with the perfect ‘char’ and the texture was just insane! Ha, I’m getting hungry thinking about it!” Royer enthused.\nFrom Singapore to Bangkok, by way of San Francisco. That\'s because Chef Pim Techamuanvivit at Nahm in Bangkok\'s COMO hotel is currently in San Francisco, home to her three other restaurants.\n\n\nShe has wowed diners since taking on the reins at Nahm, where her ‘heritage Thai cuisine’ was again awarded a Michelin star and retained its place amongst Asia\'s 50 Best Restaurants. Born in Bangkok, she pivoted from working as a Silicon Valley cognitive scientist to opening her first restaurant and continues to go from strength to strength.\n""I split my time between Bangkok and San Francisco. During the COVID-19 lockdown, I’ve been in the US, so, as soon as travel is possible again I’ll return to Bangkok and visit Jay Fai. Everyone knows about her superlative crab omelette, and of course I’ll have one. But the dish I miss most at her little restaurant is her dry congee. It’s like a super reduced, super intense congee brimming with pristine seafood. It reminds me of a breakfast jok I had growing up in Bangkok, but this version deserves her Michelin star!""\nThe famed queen of Bangkok\'s street food, Supinya Junsuta is better known by her nickname Jay Fai and dons her trademark goggles as she shows total mastery of her craft, cooking everything from crab omelettes to crab curries and dry congee to order. When Bangkok reopens to foreign visitors, she is bound to once again be one of the most popular culinary stops.\n\n\nKuala Lumpur is home to restaurants including Troika Sky Dining and Mr Chew Chino Latino Bar, both of which are overseen by executive chef and founder, Christian Bauer. When it comes time to travel again, he is set to head to Vietnam and seek out one of the more unusual choices, namely bun\xa0oc, or snail soup, often served as an appetiser.\n""It is not restaurant food that I\'ve missed, but the street food of all the countries I\'ve visited in South East Asia. If I had to pinpoint the one dish I miss most, it is oddly one I have only eaten a handful of times, but it left such an indelible impression that in my mind.\n“When I return to Hanoi, I\'ll walk down the little, crowded lane in the old town of the city and take my seat at the metal table at Bun Oc Thuy and wait for my fragrant bowl of snail and vermicelli soup to arrive. The beauty of bun\xa0oc is in the depth of\xa0its\xa0flavour. The different ingredients bubble away in their individual pots and are ladled into your bowl just before it comes to your table.""\nFinally to Hong Kong and the two Michelin-starred temple to innovative contemporary cuisine Amber at the Landmark Mandarin Oriental Hotel. It\'s where Richard Ekkebus is known for his progressive approach to dining, obsession with the finest ingredients and laser focus on delivering memorable dining experiences. Many of the ingredients he champions are Japanese, so his choice of an Asian destination is understandable.\n""I\'m almost having convulsions at the moment going cold turkey from good food and travelling! I have great love for Japan, especially as you can easily have two or even three meals in a night – there are very few places where you can do that. It has to be Tokyo and sushi for sure, followed by a night out where you invariably end up eating ramen.\n“A lot of people would assume that fine dining chefs want that fine-dining experience, but I want the sort of smaller places where chefs take you when you\'re in town and want to look after you. They\'re not in a guidebook and are often hidden down little alleys.”\nKnown across Asia as a chef\'s chef, always ready to offer advice from his more than three decades of experience, the affable Dutchman has one particular spot in mind.\n\n\n""The big secret spot for chefs in Tokyo, where you\'ll find people like Luca Fantin and Narisawa, is Ootanino Sushi in Minato. He has amazing produce and he\'s a funny guy, although the food is taken seriously, with great sushi on offer and just nine seats.\n“Whenever I\'m in Tokyo I go there, followed by a really old ramen shack like something from a 1950s yakuza movie. Every time I go I discover new places with people who have similar bad habits. It’s always one of the best nights which are made by the people and the food. Not being able to travel and eat is so frustrating as it\'s such a big part of a chef\'s inspiration, so I can\'t wait to get back out there.""\nWise words – and ones that would surely resonate with any lover of travel and food across our brilliantly diverse continent.\n', 'related_topics': ['     food ', '     gastronomy ', '     Chefs ', '     Restaurants ', '     Singapore ', '     Bangkok ', '     Manila ', '     Hong Kong ', '     Profiles ']}"

      Paradise Teochew launches 'innovative' dim sum menu for a limited time
  </h1>, 'text': 'Perhaps no other meal epitomises the weekend more than a dim sum spread – at least in the Asian (or Chinese) context. “I’ve not had dim sum in forever!” remarked a colleague; indeed, neither had we.\nSo it was with great excitement when an invitation to sample Paradise Teochew’s seasonal dim sum offerings – available from now until Aug 31 – was extended to us.\nNever mind that the hosted session fell on a weekday. It was, in our minds, a prelude to the weekend. Ushered into a private room, our host explained the ins and outs of the restaurant’s Innovative Dim Sum menu.\nOoh… “Innovative” – we were intrigued. What newfangled, experimental variations of classic dim sum dishes did the chefs have up their sleeves?\nAs it turned out, the dishes weren’t so much innovative as they were rare and – in some instances – traditional, so traditional that they’ve largely disappeared off contemporary menus. The chefs probably felt they deserved a comeback, and rightly so.\nOf the five menu items, the Deep-fried Prawn with Toast (S$7.50 for three pieces) and Steamed Siew Mai with Braised Quail’s Egg (S$6.80 for three pieces) fell into this category. Classic Hong Kong dim sum dishes, both.\nTo be fair, there was some innovation in the presentation: The Deep-fried Prawn with Toast was served canape-style, with the crustacean resting atop a sliver of golden-brown bread. A departure from the typical sesame shrimp toast one might find on other dim sum menus. We relished the contrast between the firm flesh of the prawns and the crispness of the toast.\nThe Steamed Siew Mai with Braised Quail’s Egg was preceded by a sip of apple tea, our enthusiastic server explaining that the idea was to bring out the delicate flavours of the quail’s egg. A nice flourish, we felt.\nThere was nothing novel about the Steamed Cheong-fun with Sesame sauce (S$4.80) – it was as classic as classic could be – but that did not detract from our enjoyment of its delightful silky smoothness. Lashed with a generous helping of hoisin sauce, this childhood favourite proved deeply gratifying.\nYou could say that there was some innovation in the last two dishes – Pan-fried Siew Mai with Foie Gras Sauce (S$6.80 for three pieces) and Steamed Black Truffle Char Siew Bun (S$6.80 for three pieces). The addition of black truffle and foie gras counted, we suppose.\nIn any case, why split hairs over a name. What’s important was the taste, and in that aspect, both did not disappoint. The foie gras sauce was barely discernible on the siew mai, but nonetheless it was very savoury. A fresh shrimp roe topping lent perfect crunch.\nThe black truffle, on the other hand, was distinct; it imparted a light fragrance and rich umami to the char siew. Coupled with the pillow-soft bun, it made for a very toothsome treat indeed.\nParadise Teochew is currently running a promotion where diners enjoy a 20 per cent discount on their dine-in bills and 30 per cent off their takeaway orders\n', 'related_topics': ['     food ', '     gastronomy ', '     Singapore ', '     Restaurants ', '     Fine dining ']}"

      Michelin-star restaurant Corner House re-opens with a new chef at the helm
  </h1>, 'text': 'In the six years since its inception, fine-dining restaurant Corner House has been synonymous with its plant-forward menu that reflects the history behind its location in the storied Botanic Gardens. With a new chef at the helm and its reopening last weekend, however, Corner House re-emerges on a brand new slate.\nExecutive chef David Thien takes over from long-time chef Jason Tan, who left to start his own restaurant which is slated to open in September or October this year. Thien, who is from La Reole, a small village near Bordeaux in France, came to Singapore in 2007 as the chef de cuisine of St Regis Singapore’s Italian restaurant LaBrezza. He went on to Crockfords Grill at Resorts World Sentosa where he was chef de cuisine and became sous chef at the now defunct L’Atelier de Joel Robuchon between 2011 and 2012.\nIn the years since, Thein has served as a consultant chef for the likes of TWG Tea and private members’ club Straits Clan. Before coming to Corner House, he was the executive chef at Refinery Concepts, the group behind restaurants such as Fat Cow, The Marmalade Pantry and Bedrock Bar & Grill.\nSuffice it to say, the past months have been a great leap of change for Thien. He is now tasked with creating exquisite tasting menus, which he says reflects his French and Asian roots (his mother is Alsatian and Corsican; his father is of Chinese and Mauritian descent).\n“It’s been an emotional rollercoaster,” said Thien with candour of his new role and the timing with which it has transpired. The plan was for the restaurant to open in May; he had taken the mantle just two weeks before Circuit Breaker measures were put in place.\n“[There’s been] happiness, frustration, perseverance, boredom… [During the lockdown] I worked with some key people to do research and development and used that time to really develop my ideas. Sometimes a dish comes up great; sometimes very far from [what was] imagined. In my previous jobs, I couldn’t express myself in the shape of set menus, so I am very excited.”\n“After living in Asia for so long, I’m accustomed to certain flavours. I really like them and want to use them in my food.” – David Thien\nLIFE, INTERPRETED\nWhile some dishes are named after Southeast Asian classics, they are distinctly rooted in French techniques, which is where Thien’s training lies. Diners can expect the likes of Beef Rendang parsed as a “fusion of pasta and wagyu rendang” accentuated with fresh herbs, flowers and sherry vinegar; and Achards, a play on Mauritian pickled vegetables, which is similar to Southeast Asian achar, where the pickled vegetables are served with a granita of their pickling liquid, burrata cream and cured hamachi (kingfish).\n“I don’t have a deep knowledge of other cuisines besides French and I don’t wish for people to think that I’m pretending to cook their food,” Thien pointed out.\n“But after living in Asia for so long, I’m accustomed to certain flavours. I really like them and want to use them in my food… My eating habits have changed and so has my cooking. It’s a natural process.”\nCorner House is now open for lunch and dinner, with prices ranging from S$78 for a three-course lunch menu to S$218 for a seven-course dinner, and S$268 for the Chef Menu.\xa0 \xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     food ', '     Restaurants ', '     Chefs ', '     gastronomy ', '     Singapore ', '     botanic gardens ', '     Fine dining ']}"

      Why foodies need to check out these newly opened and revamped restaurants
  </h1>, 'text': 'Just days before the ""circuit breaker""\xa0hit in early April, Frank Shen and Leon Tan were stoked about starting operations at their new restaurant, Laut, along Stanley Street.\nA week before that, stalwart Italian restaurant Forlino announced its new identity, Rivieria Forlino, marking a shift to a lighter, more Mediterranean direction and a new Franco-Italian executive chef at the helm.\nA little earlier on, French chef David Thien had taken over the helm of one-Michelin-star Corner House and was raring to debut the exquisite offerings he’d created for the popular restaurant set in the verdant heart of the Botanic Gardens.\nBut then, the world as we knew it was put on hard pause, and F&B establishments, both wizened and new, were forced to spiral into survival mode and a completely different business model.\nFast forward three months and today, these establishments are dusting off their worn cocoons and re-entering the world sans the flash and fanfare that typically accompanies the start of something new in the F&B realm.\n“We actually got our operating licence two days into the Circuit Breaker while we were switching to an online platform,” said Laut’s co-founder Frank Shen. His team worked up to 18 hours a day for almost two weeks to transform what was designed to be a dine-in business to one that operated entirely through delivery.\nThat done, they took the rest of the time during lockdown to improve recipes and dish presentations. Now that they are open for dine-in, they are offering food and drinks inspired by Southeast Asia and, as their restaurant’s name suggests, the sea, which is what “laut” means in Malay.\nOn the plate, this translates to dishes featuring locally sourced produce such as Prawn Rajah – rice cooked with a pesto of Asian herbs and topped with pungent petai, chopped century eggs and grilled king prawns.\nLaut’s inventive cocktails, too, emphasise regional ingredients such as Borneo peppers, Malaysian molasses, Sarawak pineapple and sugarcane.\nBORN AGAIN\nOver at Boat Quay, Lumo, a 70-seater cocktail bar that opened in March, finally has the chance to show off its beautifully designed Scandinavian-style bar and open kitchen again.\nEverything about this new joint is conceptual, from the current drinks menu built around “light’s prismatic nature, represented by seven categories corresponding to seven constituent colours of natural light”, to the food, which includes painstaking dishes like chicken wings that are first brined and aged for three days before being smoked on an Applewood grill.\nHaving closed its flagship in Robertson Quay, SPRMRKT debuted its sprawling new restaurant in the Dempsey enclave just three days before lockdown. It has since reopened with a produce-driven, vegetable-forward dinner menu that includes deliciously wholesome dishes such as a hearty grilled Hamachi cheek and collar served with capers, burnt butter and anchovies, and an excellent slab of tamarind and coconut sugar-kissed mackerel accompanied by buttered kale and tomato salsa.\nRight next door, the SPRMRKT group debuted TUGA during the Circuit Breaker, a Portuguese restaurant with roots in Taiwan, in partnership with proprietor Carlos Couto.\nIt serves rustic Portuguese classics such as francesinha do carvalho, a filet mignon sandwich blanketed in melted cheese and a thick tomato sauce, and cod a bras (shredded salted cod and fried potatoes bound with egg).\nALMOST NEW\nNew York’s Lucali – described by The New York Times as “a luxury restaurant disguised as a pizza joint” and made internationally famous by a turn in an episode of David Chang’s Ugly Delicious on Netflix – was slated to make its debut in the second quarter of the year.\nAlas, it remains closed till “the first or second week of July” said a representative.\nNevertheless, foodies in the know have already sampled a taste of Lucali BYBG’s\xa0 non-pizza dishes since it began offering food delivery services in May. These include some superlative pastas dished out by head chef Ariana Flores, of the now-defunct Osteria Mozza, and recreations of co-owner Gibran Beydoun’s mother’s rustic meatloaf.\nWe were lucky enough to get a taste of Riviera Forlino’s new executive chef Remy Carmignani’s dishes just before lockdown hit and we are pleased to report that the food is as beguiling as the revamped dining room. Among the standouts is a dish of handmade tortellini filled with slow-cooked Moroccan-style lamb shoulder, and a lobster and shellfish bouillabaisse crowned with a garlic parmentier.\nChef David Thien, meanwhile, is busy serving his first meals as the new executive chef at Cornerhouse. His distinct brand of cuisine reflects his French-Mauritian heritage and his love for his adopted home here in Singapore.\nDiners can expect starters like a “variation of achar” in which pickled vegetables are served with their frozen pickling juice, whipped burrata cream and Japanese hamachi; and a sambal meuniere, which Thien playfully describes as a “French version of sambal stingray”.\nAnd then there are the restaurants that must remain shut for the timing being, such as 1-V:U, because the hotel it is located in only reopens in August.\nHead chef Ace Tan isn’t letting that stop him from purveying his promising brand of progressive Asian cuisine though. The restaurant has been reincarnated for the time being as a 15-seat pop-up on the second level of Alkaff Mansion.\nOther soon-to-open establishments like multi-concept space Appetite by Nouri\xa0 have been delayed by factors like halted construction work, or in the case of Kotuwa – the highly-anticipated Sri Lankan restaurant by Cheek Bistro and Cloudstreet chef-owner Rishi Naleendra – by the absence of foreign staff who aren’t yet able to enter Singapore.\nAll is not lost though, as diners can still get a taste of Kotuwa, whose complex, spicy fare continues to be available for takeaway and delivery every Sunday from Jul 5 from CloudStreet’s premises along Amoy Street.\n', 'related_topics': ['     food ', '     gastronomy ', '     Singapore ', '     Restaurants ', '     Fine dining ']}"

      Fresh air, open spaces: Restaurants with outdoor areas for alfresco dining
  </h1>, 'text': 'The Sunday after Phase 2 was announced, I enjoyed a hearty meal at a restaurant in Beach Road with a pair of close friends. Now I realise that the previous sentence is not how punchy first lines of articles are supposed to read, but it was a seminal moment. It was the first meal in months that I’d eaten on a dining table that wasn’t my own.\nQuite happily for us, we were the only patrons apart from one other table of four in the entire restaurant. While we were thrilled to finally share a meal together again, and one with proper service at that, stepping out into the world post-circuit breaker came with its fair share of concerns.\nArmed with too much information about how COVID-19 spreads, particularly through droplets that we expel when we talk and laugh (two essential elements to a great meal out), we began to wonder if eating alfresco at our next meet-up would be a better option.\n\n\nOUT AND ABOUT\nRestaurants have been doing brisk business since Phase 2 measures were announced, but the diminished number of seats that they can offer because of distancing measures continues to put a damper on their bottom line.\nSome, like chef Willin Low’s mod-Sin izakaya Roketto, have been lucky enough to expand their dining area to the outdoors, which helps allay concerns among folks like us about dining in an enclosed space with numerous other strangers.\nOthers, like The Halia at the Botanic Gardens, have the privilege of expanding to a whole other building. Previously reserved as an event venue, The neighbouring Villa now provides extra outdoor and indoor seating for The Halia, on top of the latter’s 30 alfresco seats and indoor dining room that accommodates about 22 people.\nNo stranger to the alfresco-loving crowd, Robertson Quay has an abundance of F&B establishments with outdoor seating. Among them is Mediterranean restaurant Summerlong, whose indoor dining room is semi-open-air.\nCafe2000 at M Hotel Singapore is another option, as is Beast & Butterflies at M Social Singapore, which can seat up to 46 people in its alfresco section. Even the opulent Grand Shanghai at King’s Centre has 10 outdoor seats, which were introduced last March.\nOver at the Fullerton precinct, the likes of L’Entrecote and Caffe Fernet at Customs House have seen enthusiastic response from avid diners who thronged the establishments as soon as they re-opened.\n“That first weekend (of Phase 2) was crazy,” said Olivier Bendel, CEO of Deliciae Hospitality Management which owns L’Entrecote and Sabio by the Sea at Sentosa’s Quayside Isle.\n“At Customs House, we are lucky that our terrace is really stretched out, so we have been able to maximise the space outside to make up for what we lose to [safe] distancing inside.”\nWhile the last two weekends brought a healthy crowd at his restaurants, Bendel says that weekday business is still quiet both in the CBD and at Sentosa.\nSUP IN THE CITY\nFrom a consumer point of view, there is no better time to enjoy the spoils of these areas while they remain crowd-free.\nOne such establishment is Zafferano Italian Restaurant & Lounge, perched on the 43rd storey of Ocean Financial Centre. Its alfresco Terrace Lounge that looks out over Marina Bay typically serves drinks and bar bites. But should guests ask to order their meal from the adjoining restaurant’s menu, the service staff would be happy to oblige, said operations manager Vadim Korob.\nSeveral buildings away, microbrewery LeVeL33 harbours 40 high table seats and strategically placed plants that serve to keep groups of diners relatively shielded from one another.\nTo prevent the potential bottlenecks that can form when there is a queue to get into the 33rd-storey restaurant, its reception has been moved to the ground floor lobby where guests are put through the standard check-in procedures.\nMarina Bay Sands restaurants like Bread Street Kitchen and YardBird Southern Table & Bar have increased outdoor seating, with\xa042 seats at the former and\xa030 at the latter. They are lovely locales for meals\xa0with a view of the water and a cool evening breeze.\n\n\nMeanwhile, with outdoor dining in mind, the likes of The Lo & Behold Group, the company behind restaurants such as Le Bon Funk, Tanjong Beach Club and OverEasy, will soon offer picnic baskets.\nThese will be filled with delicious options like chicken liver parfait crowaffles (that’s a flaky pastry waffle) with fig jam, stuffed Camembert truffles with walnuts, and custard-filled choux pastries. The baskets come with the option of a bottle of wine or gin and tonic cocktails.\nAnd so it appears that there is no need to stay indoors even when you want to dine out. The only requirements for alfresco eating: Careful planning and reservations made well in advance.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Singapore ', '     Restaurants ', '     dining ', '     food ', '     gastronomy ', '     Fine dining ', '     Restaurants ']}"

      Banyan Tree opens organic farm in Thailand with Michelin-starred chef
  </h1>, 'text': 'Singapore-founded hospitality group\xa0Banyan Tree has opened Thailand’s first gourmet organic\xa0farm. Located in Chiangmai, the farm, named ORI9IN, is a joint venture between Banyan Tree and James Noble, two Michelin-starred chef turned sustainable farmer and founder of The Boutique Farmers.\nSet on 140 hectares\xa0of land, ORI9IN\xa0features retained farming and farm rental spaces to grow specific ingredients, as well as to test and grow overseas products for over 15 top Michelin-starred restaurants and hotels in Thailand. Some of these restaurants include Paste Bangkok, Suhring, R-Haan and Igniv.\n""This new farm in Chiangmai is our flagship pilot for sustainable farming for healthier eating, and we definitely have intentions to expand. A partnership grounded on the passion for a sustainable future through food, this enterprise leverages the post COVID-19 quest for better health and wellbeing,"" said\xa0Ho Renyung, Vice-President, Brand HQ of Banyan Tree.\nFamilies can also rent land, bond over farming and enjoy their harvests, which will be delivered to their homes weekly. The farm’s community garden grows a variety of vegetables, including aubergine, kale, chillies, pumpkins, green beans, basil, lemongrass, garlic and tomatoes. It also provides complimentary vegetable\xa0harvesting to villagers daily.\n""A partnership grounded on the passion for a sustainable future through food, this enterprise leverages the post COVID-19 quest for better health and wellbeing."" –\xa0Ho Renyung\nThe farm will officially open to the public this October and will feature a zero-waste fine-dining experience for guests. The farm’s restaurant, named Waiting For May, is home to the world’s first white menu experience: Guests simply write their preferences on a piece of white paper, and then Noble and his team will whip up a meal based on those preferences.\n“To enable a zero-waste kitchen, diners experience an alternative gastronomy of fine-dining where ingredients and produce take centrestage over price and plate presentation. I will personally whip up tantalising dishes using quality products that come into the kitchen from the fields and locally sourced by my wife May on the very day itself –\xa0a real farm-to-table concept with an element of food surprises,” Noble said.\n“Luxury is changing. Fine-dining is changing. What people want from the new norm is to know where their food is coming from. They care much more about the process than whether there’s a white cloth on the table. This is the future.”\nWith the change in seasons, each dish may never repeat itself, with the ingredients dictating the culinary direction. Healthy\xa0traditional techniques will also be incorporated to the process of procuring and cooking the ingredients, including 16-hour earth oven roasting, fermenting, sun-drying, pickling and curing of the food.\nThe farm will also have venues for wedding and corporate events. For the general public, there will be ticketed options for different experiences, including an exploration of a maize maze, live demonstrations at jam and ketchup factories, and a first-hand experience of\xa0crop planting. On a visit to ORI9IN, guests\xa0will also be able to purchase the farm’s fresh produce.\n“Luxury is changing. Fine dining is changing. What people want from the new norm is to know where their food is coming from. They care much more about the process than whether there’s a white cloth on the table.""\xa0– James Noble\nThe farm is a\xa030-minute drive from\xa0Chiangmai. “Looking ahead, we will provide other modes of transport such as shuttle bus service for guests from Chiangmai to our farm in the future,” Noble said.\nIn the future, guests may also book a unique farm stay experience\xa0on the land. “Currently, there is no Banyan Tree resort\xa0nearby,” Ho said.\xa0“But we are definitely exploring the option of a unique accommodation concept as we think many travellers would be excited about a farm stay experience in nature, especially post COVID-19.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     Thailand ', '     food ', '     dining ', '     gastronomy ', '     sustainability ', '     Luxury Destinations ', '     Fine dining ']}"

      Is culinary cultural appropriation a thing in multi-ethnic Singapore?
  </h1>, 'text': 'In multi-ethnic Singapore, culinary cultural appropriation can be a complex subject. A nation forged from multiple diasporas, Singapore is, as the old trope goes, “a melting pot” that has birthed a unique national culture far richer than the sum of its parts.\nWe mix Maggi with mala, fish heads with curry, and stuff rice dumplings with chicken rendang (yes, really), all in the name of our obsessive gastro-culture. So it can be hard to see the line between culinary cultural appropriation and evolution. Or is there a line at all?\nBack in the 18th and 19th centuries, as Singapore blossomed into a hub of entrepot trade, our ancestors were too busy building a life to concern themselves with what they should wear, cook or eat in order to express and safeguard their cultural identities as Indians, Malays, Chinese or Eurasians. They just were who they were.\nSome became Peranakans (or Straits-born) by virtue of whom they married and the period during which they were born. This cultural group, especially, assimilated in the most maximalist of ways. They adopted and gilded the kebayas of the Southeast Asian islands, borrowed from the flavours of their neighbours’ cuisines, and learnt to speak the English of the colonial masters. From these influences they designed a colourful, multi-faceted culture that is today proudly celebrated as all that is appealing about Singapore as a destination.\n“We mix Maggi with mala, fish heads with curry, and stuff rice dumplings with chicken rendang (yes, really), all in the name of our obsessive gastro-culture.”\nDOES THAT NOT MAKE PERANAKANS THE ORIGINAL CULTURAL APPROPRIATORS OF THE COUNTRY?\nTo agree with that would be to say that everyone else was complicit in stealing from each other’s culinary cannons. Cuisines are born of nostalgia, necessity and innovation; a need to recreate family flavours in a new land and an urge to bring a taste of faraway lands to our own homes. They are a product of our experiences and memories, a living, breathing expression of our expansive identities.\xa0 \xa0\nThe early Chinese and Malays didn’t grow up on laksa or otak-otak or many of the other dishes distinct to Singaporean culture today. These foods are the result of migration, cultural crossovers, friendships and innovation. Singapore’s cuisines were literally built on those pillars.\nSensitivities arise, however, when one culture’s traditions are side-lined or substituted for another’s in the name of a national narrative. Kueh, for instance, is as much a Malay culinary tradition as it is a Peranakan or Chinese one.\nYet kueh is largely showcased as a Peranakan custom. “Take kueh salat or ondeh-ondeh,” said Azimin Saini, founder of Tempeh Culture. “The Malays have been making it for years, but in the last couple of years, they have become synonymous with Peranakan desserts. Why is that, when so many other cultures make ondeh-ondeh, even if it is called by a different name?”\n\n\nPUT YOUR STAMP, NOT YOUR LABEL, ON IT \nThis simmering distaste for the overlooking of Malay culinary culture for the more colourful mixed bag of the Peranakans’ came to a head earlier this month when Violet Oon Singapore began marketing a Nyonya Nasi Ambeng Family Tray.\n\n\nNasi ambeng is a traditional Javanese dish served at important occasions like weddings and Ramadan, and eaten after religious celebrations. It is a lavish, communal platter of steamed rice and dishes like chicken curry, sambal goreng (spicy fried tempeh and long beans), beef rendang, urap (a vegetable and coconut dish) and lots more.\n“Nasi ambeng is time-consuming and labour-intensive, which is why it is hardly available outside of homes. It is a culture we, the Javanese diaspora, continue to preserve. To suddenly see it labelled as Nyonya really hit a raw nerve among the Malay community,” explained Azimin.\nViolet Oon Singapore later apologised for having “insensitively used the name of a symbolic dish for a Nyonya interpretation that failed to articulate or acknowledge the rich significance and origins of Nasi Ambeng which originated from Java, Indonesia”.\nIn Saini’s view, there is a firmly drawn line between assimilation and appropriation.\n“I think we need to be conscious of whether you are erasing someone’s culture when you create or label a dish,” he stressed. “When you create pork belly buah keluak biryani, for example, you’re not taking away anything from anyone; you’re just creating something new. But if we leave the labels such as Nyonya Nasi Ambeng as they appear, then you’ll eventually have a generation of people who think nasi ambeng or kueh salat are solely Peranakan dishes.”\n“I think we need to be conscious of whether you are erasing someone’s culture when you create or label a dish.”\nR.E.S.P.E.C.T \nWhat lies between cultural assimilation and appropriation, then, is sensitivity. Cultural appropriation is widely defined as when a dominant culture adopts the cultural customs of a non-dominant culture without understanding or respecting the original culture and context, and then profiting from it. Does that mean you can’t make bak chor mee because you’re not Chinese? No, of course not. Just ask the guys from Li Na Fishball Noodle.\n“Does that mean you can’t make bak chor mee because you’re not Chinese? No, of course not.”\nIn numerous restaurants, chefs have created cuisines that are a celebration of various cultures. In Singapore, many fine-dining restaurants lean on the refinement of European and Japanese influences to create pricey tasting menus that diners are more than willing to fork out for.\nIn mixed-race homes, too, new cuisines are being created every day. One couple of Indian and Mexican descents recently told me that they had created their own sub-cuisine they’ve dubbed “Indimex”, just by cooking together in their home kitchen.\nUltimately, food – especially in Singapore – is a binding force. It brings us together in a way that no Racial Harmony Day activity ever could.\nWe may all live our own cultural traditions, but we also constantly make new familial ones unique to our kith and kin. My grandmother made buah keluak like any other Peranakan matriarch, except she insisted that that buah keluak should only be made with pork, never chicken (yes, I can hear the other bibiks scoffing).\nMy mother carried on this tradition and served you char kway (never “yu tiao” because Mandarin was barely spoken back in their day), on the side. This manner of serving the dish is probably traditional to no one else but us.\nAll this means is that as we evolve, travel, grow and are exposed to other cultures that we eventually come to cherish in our daily lives, our cultural barriers will continue to blur. Haven’t we already come to embrace laksa pesto pasta or prata sausage rolls?\nSo let’s eat what we enjoy, cook the food of other cultures and share them as widely as possible. The only pre-requisite for said enjoyment is respect. Respect for the dishes’ provenance and for the people who cook them. And never, ever claim something that’s not your own. Is this not a basic tenet to live by in all aspects of life?\n“Let’s eat what we enjoy, cook the food of other cultures and share them as widely as possible. The only pre-requisite for said enjoyment is respect.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     food ', '     Singapore ', '     Peranakan ', '     Fine dining ']}"

      Healthier instant noodles are possible – this Singapore entrepreneur developed it 
  </h1>, 'text': 'If you’ve ever instinctively reached out for a pack of chips or rustled up a bowl of instant noodles in a peckish moment and immediately regretted the calories consumed, you’re not alone.\nThat guilt trip, though, may be lessened now.\nChristoph Langwallner, co-founder and CEO of NamZ, has just launched the WhatIF Foods range of products in Singapore and Malaysia. Its Bambara groundnut instant noodles are dehydrated through steaming and high-velocity air instead of deep frying, resulting in 55 per cent less fat, 130 per cent more dietary fibre and 110 per cent more protein than the typical ones in the market. Its shakes and soups have up to 57 per cent less sugar and 75 per cent less sodium respectively when compared to popular large-brand alternatives out in the market.\n\n\nA post shared by WhatIF Foods (@whatiffoods)\nFor over 20 years, Langwallner, a food scientist born in Austria and now based in Singapore, did research and business development for agriculture and food-related companies in Austria, Russia and the United Kingdom, before starting his own ingredient company, Symega, in India together with his wife.\nWhile in India, he grew increasingly conflicted as he spent his days drumming up sales of addictive-laden snacks at the office, and upon returning home, discouraging his young children from eating junk food. He added: “My wife was sporty, but my kids and I have a tendency to put on weight easily. That was another wake-up call.”\nThese facts also disturbed Langwallner: The earth is producing enough food to feed 10 billion people, yet it is losing forests the size of a football field every second; and overeating kills three times more people than famine does.\nLangwallner said: “I thought to myself that there must be a better way of doing things, where innovation can be used for sustainability rather than science for knowledge’s sake. How can technology be used beneficially to make meaningful and tasty fun food?”\nLangwallner focused on instant noodles because it is one of the most popular convenience foods in the world. Last November, NamZ was among nine social enterprises that were awarded a total of S$1.3 million in funding from the DBS Foundation Social Enterprise Grant Programme to scale up its noodle production to make it more accessible and widely available.\n\n\nBEYOND STAPLES LIKE RICE AND WHEAT\nWhatIF products are made from “future-fit crops”, a term used to describe crops that are climate-resilient, nutrient-dense and resource-efficient. Their inherent ability to survive in spite of drought and poor soil conditions, with minimal demand for inputs such as water and fertiliser, makes them more economically viable for smallholder farmers.\nAccording to the 2018 Future Smart Food report by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, only 103 out of the nearly 30,000 edible plant species worldwide provide up to 90 per cent of the calories in the human diet. Only a few staples such as maize, rice, wheat, soybean and potato account for as much as 80 per cent of the world’s caloric intake. This puts immense pressure on a few crops to meet the planet’s nutritional needs.\nNamZ uses future-fit crops such as Bambara groundnut, moringa and ube (purple yam) in its WhatIF Foods range. It is also exploring Bambara groundnut milk.\n\n\nA post shared by WhatIF Foods (@whatiffoods)\n\n\n“Biodiversity on lands is beneficial for human health, the more diverse foods we eat, the more nutrition we receive.” – Christoph Langwallner\n“Biodiversity on lands is beneficial for human health, the more diverse foods we eat, the more nutrition we receive,” Langwallner shared. “The supply chain of a few corn, wheat and rice production centres shipping to the rest of the world is being disrupted and it will be so for a couple of decades. The regionalisation of our food supplies is massively important. We need to directly link farming communities to the factories and then to the folks that need the food.”\nNamZ’s pilot factory is based in Johor Bahru’s Iskandar region and it is working with a manufacturing company that has the capacity to produce 250 million portions of WhatIF instant noodles annually. Its noodles are already available in places such as Nanyang Technological University’s Canteen 9 and Springleaf Prata Place outlets. It is also working towards biodegradable packaging besides the recyclable LDPE, PET and paper box materials that it is currently using now.\n“The biggest challenge is getting consumers on a journey with us. We’re here to encourage eating more nutritious snacks, consuming in a more sustainable manner, and supporting a fairer food system that looks after smallholder farmers. We want to make it easier and more pleasurable by offering tasty convenience products,” said Langwallner.\n“But unless we create a demand, we can’t impact the other side. We must see that it is not an ‘either-or’ equation, but achieving both well-being and impact at the same time.”\n“We’re here to encourage eating more nutritious snacks, consuming in a more sustainable manner, and supporting a fairer food system that looks after smallholder farmers.” – Christoph Langwallner\n', 'related_topics': ['     food ', '     Singapore ', '     Profiles ']}"

      Once ‘fast food’ for farmers: How rice dumplings have evolved over the years
  </h1>, 'text': 'They may be synonymous with the Dragon Boat Festival, but rice dumplings predate the event and have been a staple for millennia. More than five thousand years ago, the Chinese began wrapping food in leaves and roasting them by the fire, preserving them for future, fuss-free consumption.\nThey were, as Echo Zhao wrote in The World of Chinese, “A customary version of fast food, especially for farmers who were too busy in the fields to head home for a meal”.\nAcross the middle kingdom, rice dumplings varied as widely as the crops that were planted or the dialects spoken from province to province. Some were sweet; others, salty. Some were austere, while others were more lavish.\nThe Northern Chinese preferred their dumplings sweet. Some of these sweet treats were plain and dipped in sugar, which is perhaps the root of Southeast Asia’s kueh lopes – glutinous rice dumplings coated in coconut and served with molten gula Melaka. Beijingers, meanwhile, liked to stuff their rice dumplings with candied or dried red dates.\nThe Southerners, ever the maximalists of the country’s two halves, filled theirs with salted egg yolks, pork, chestnuts, mushrooms, mung beans, red beans and dates. In time, these variants came to be associated with festival foods. After all, as Chinese celebrations go, more is joyously more.\nAnd so each year, Chinese restaurants around the world outdo themselves with ever more creative renditions. The dumplings – gilded with gold leaf, anointed with truffle oil, perfumed with roses – are celebrated as foods are celebrated today: With prayerful grace of a pretty photograph and a pensive caption on social media before they are consumed.\nBut lest we lose sight of the story behind the rice dumpling or Dragon Boat Festival (and there’s always a good story behind a Chinese food tradition), here’s a quick recap of its history and lore.\nDuring the tempestuous Warring States Period (475-221 BCE), the exiled poet, patriot and imperial advisor Qu Yuan dramatically flung himself into a river upon learning that rival kingdom occupiers had taken hold of his home state of Chu. Unable to recover his body, locals dropped rice dumplings into the water in the hopes that the fish would find them more palatable than Qu Yuan’s corpse.\nQu Yuan’s death is now commemorated annually on the fifth day of the fifth month of the lunar calendar, with the sale and devouring of sumptuous rice dumplings. Here is a sampling of what’s available this year.\nCRYSTAL JADE\nEven if you’re going low carb, there’s a dumpling out there for you. For one, Crystal Jade’s (estore.crystaljade.com) new Eight Treasure Quinoa Rice Dumpling (S$6.80), studded with flavourful delights such as chai poh (preserved radish), Japanese Nameko mushrooms, black-eyed beans, dried shitake mushrooms, red beans and chestnuts.\nBonus: It happens to be vegetarian.

      4 of the best wine gadgets to optimise your wine enjoyment at home
  </h1>, 'text': 'If you’re a wine enthusiast, you would have seen the Coravin wielded by sommeliers. Some wine bars even offer wines by the glass with the gadget.\nThe contraption, which clamps itself atop a wine bottle, serves wine without removing the cork: It inserts a medical grade needle into the cork, pressurises the bottle with argon gas, and pours the wine. The tiny incision in the cork seals itself, preserving the remaining wine in the bottle.\nYou can now open that bottle of Burgundy without worrying about it getting spoiled or oxidised if you can’t finish it in one sitting.\nThe Coravin Model Eleven is the latest iteration of the gadget since it was launched in international markets seven years ago.\nWhile earlier models require a push of a lever to release the wine, Model Eleven dispenses it automatically when you tip the gadget over your glass. It also comes with Bluetooth, which connects to the Coravin Moments App that checks your system stats, picks wines to suit your mood, and suggests food pairings.\nCoravin Model Eleven, S$1,285, from 1855thebottleshop.com\xa0\n\n\nWINE DISPENSER\nDo you have one of those capsule-coffee machines that dispenses your espresso at the perfect temperature? The D-Vine machine, which was created by French start-up 10-Vins, works on the same principle, but for wine.\nA test tube-like wine flacon (containing a serving for one glass) is inserted into the top of the D-Vine, which reads the RFID tag on the flacon and determines its optimum serving condition.\nThe wine is then released from the flacon, running through an internal tube that aerates the liquid (equivalent to a three-hour decanting), cools it down to its ideal serving temperature, and dispenses it – all in a less than a minute.\nD-Vine’s official distributor in Asia, De Majestic Vines, has picked a selection of 12 wine flacons from D-Vine’s wine menu.\n“The idea of D-vine grew from my frustrations in getting a glass of good wine with the perfect oxygenation and temperature when I needed it,” said Thibaut Jarrousse, chief executive officer of 10-Vins. “Everyone deserves a glass of perfect wine – whenever they want it.”\nD-Vine (with a complimentary set of six flacons), S$3,599, from shop.demajesticvines.com\n\n\nSPRAY AND SAVE\nThe Winesave Pro protects your opened bottle of wine so you can drink it again days, weeks or months later without it getting oxidised.\nSimply take the gadget, which is essentially a canister of odourless Argon gas, spray it into the bottle for one second, and replace the cork or screwcap. The gas displaces the oxygen in the bottle and forms a protective layer over the wine.\nThe Winesave Pro has no expiry date and can last up to 150 applications.\nWinesave Pro, S$49.90, from winesave.com.sg\nTEMPERATURE MONITOR\nServing wine at the right temperature, which varies for whites, reds and bubblies, is a crucial factor in wine enjoyment as a few degrees of difference can throw the flavour profile off-balance.\nThe Kelvin K2 smart wine thermometer takes away the guesswork: Download the Kelvin K2 App, clip the thermometer transmitter onto the bottle, and select the wine type on the app. The app will let you know if you need to chill the wine by displaying its current and optimum serving temperatures.\nWhile the wine is being chilled in your refrigerator, the attached thermometer transmitter, with its Bluetooth connectivity, will send temperature information to your Kelvin K2 App and inform you once the bottle is ready to be removed.\nKelvin K2, £39.95 / S$70, from mykelvin.co.uk\n', 'related_topics': ['     gastronomy ', '     food ', '     F&B ', '     home ', '     Singapore ', '     Fine dining ']}"

We have a lot of overseas customers and this has affected our operations drastically,” business and marketing director Leong shared with CNA Luxury.\n“People typically don’t buy chocolates in [the northern hemisphere] summer as the items don’t hold up well in the heat, so we’ve already missed the peak season of chocolate shipping to our overseas partners.”\nFossa’s chocolates are sold in over 140 stores abroad, mostly in the United States and Canada, with the rest in Australia, France, the Maldives and Hong Kong.\nIn spite of having its own battle to fight, the team also turned their thoughts towards other local retailers whose sales were affected when customers could not frequent their cafe distributors and purchase their products.\n“In the spirit of supporting each other, we started listing some products of homegrown brands with similar ethos to ours on our website,” said Chua. These include tea leaves from Pekoe & Imp and Antea Social, mystery books from The Novel Encounter, Huggs Coffee’s brewed coffee, Foreword Coffee's coffee bags, nail wraps from Nodspark, and Hush Candle’s essential oil room sprays and candles.\nFossa’s plans to launch new items such as snack boxes and limited-edition chocolates throughout the year were also changed.\n“COVID-19 gave us time off our usual production schedule to bring forward the new launches,” said Leong. “We see that product innovations keep customers excited. With the disruption of our traditional sales channels and consumer behaviour, it is crucial for us to quickly adapt in order to continue doing what we love.”\nOne of the limited releases was a batch of 50 chocolates made with Oko Caribe beans from a smallholding farmer in the Dominican Republic. The beans were set aside for two years for an aging experiment and were only used early this year.\nThe result was a fun melange of raspberry jam and manuka honey flavours, with a taste reminiscent of a well-aged orange wine. Customers snapped up all the bars within a few days, with some dropping not just one, but a few into their carts.\n“People were buying as gifts to friends and colleagues, as well as comfort food for themselves,” said Chua, who is the chief wizard\xa0together with Chia in experimenting with flavours and making the chocolates.\nFor every flavour that finally makes it on the market, there are nine others that fail the taste test, such as a chilli-and-pineapple combination that Chua liked, but Chia didn’t.\nChia explained: “When it comes to local flavours,\xa0consumers are much more particular because these are familiar to them. So we need to ensure that resemblance when we recreate it in our chocolate.\n“Chilli in itself has no body to its taste, so we tried a variety of ingredient combinations. The dish that eventually inspired our final Chilli Peanut Praline was the\xa0satay\xa0sauce that had peanuts.”\xa0\nThe company has done well in the International Chocolate Awards Asia-Pacific for the past three years, sweeping a record haul of seven awards in 2019 for flavours such as Pak Eddy 70% Dark, Duck Shit Dancong Oolong, Chilli Peanut Praline and Salted Egg Cereal, which also happen to be the more popular flavours among its customers, especially the overseas ones.\nSome were developed quite serendipitously. For example, the Duck Shit Dancong Oolong chocolate, so-called because one of its ingredients is a special oolong varietal from the Phoenix Mountain in China’s Guangdong province that is fertilised by duck poop, resulted from hours of research for a tea-chocolate pairing workshop with Pekoe & Imp in July 2019.\nThankfully, it neither tastes nor smells like its name. Instead, it carries flavours of longan and malt with a floral and mineral finish, enhanced by wine barrel-fermented cacao beans from Pahang, Malaysia.\nThe team is currently re-evaluating their business model and mapping out the next steps to grow it further. Leong said: “We started the company with the aim to bring better chocolate to our local community, and did this by introducing it as a product that’s made with care and intent, as reflected by our sourcing and making ethos.\n“Over the years, we also started pushing the flavour boundaries beyond the typical plain chocolate bar, introducing unconventional flavour combinations that evoke memories and emotions. Even as we continue to grow our footprint and volume over the next three to five years, we will ensure that our company’s DNA of stringent standards, curiosity for flavours and experimental nature continues.”\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Singapore ', '     food ', '     Profiles ']}"

      Father's Day feasts: Leave restaurants to the eager crowds, order in instead
  </h1>, 'text': 'So Father’s Day is ‘round the corner and dining-in now on the cards. But Phase 2 happened like a rainbow appearing out from the clouds, except you’re too busy driving through a storm and there’s no way to reach for your phone to take pictures of it.\nThat’s kind of where restaurants are at when it comes to the news that they can re-open their doors to diners in a matter of days.

      Singapore chefs and bartenders are creating art to raise funds for charity
  </h1>, 'text': 'Perhaps it is the ethos of hospitality that underpins their business, but despite being one of the hardest hit industries in the current pandemic, folks from Singapore’s food and beverage community keep finding ways to give back. The latest among their initiatives is a charity auction featuring artworks by well-known chefs and bartenders in Singapore.\nTo be held on June 20\xa0at 4pm on Facebook, Perrier’s #LockdownArtists Charity Auction hopes to raise S$10,000 for The Food Bank Singapore through the sale of works by the likes of Janice Wong, Rishi Naleendra, chef-owner of Cloudstreet; Petrina Loh, chef-owner of Morsels; Jorge Conde, head bartender of Smoke & Mirrors; and Naz Arjuna, head bartender of Bitters & Love.\nAs the event’s title suggests, the works of art were created during the circuit breaker by the chefs and bartenders who used the medium as a form of expression during this difficult period. Director of PR company Food News, Ivy Woo, conceived the idea after seeing pictures of Naleendra’s paintings on his Instagram account.\n\n\nA post shared by Rishi Naleendra (@rishinaleendra)\n“It got me thinking about how chefs and bartenders are inherently artists, and if their creativity could transcend their menus and help a greater cause at the same time,” she said.\nAfter approaching several F&B professionals about sharing their art, Woo took the idea to carbonated mineral water company Perrier, which\xa0immediately agreed to lend its weight as presenting sponsor. They are supported by Nestle’s #AlwaysOpenForYou initiative that aims to provide aid to business partners and communities.\n""It got me thinking about how chefs and bartenders are inherently artists, and if their creativity could transcend their menus and help a greater cause at the same time.""\xa0– Ivy Woo\nARTISTS ANYWAY\nThe multi-layered works of art for sale are impressively wrought. Arjuna’s acrylic and watercolour on canvas titled When Will I Be King Again?\xa0depicts the humility that comes with an uncertain future expressed in the form an irresolute face of a lion.\xa0\n\n\nA post shared by Naz Arjuna (@naz.arjuna)\nThe same uncertainty is parsed in more abstract form in Mire, an acrylic on canvas piece by Phoebe Oviedo, sous chef of Open Farm Community.\xa0Naleendra’s If Thoughts Had Shapes\xa0is a futuristic Dali-esque depiction of the inner workings of the elements that shape the lives of humans. \xa0\xa0\nWithout doubt, the works of art display another creative facet of the inventive F&B professionals, showcasing a side of them seldom seen. Head chef of Open Farm Community, Olivier Truesdale-Jutras, who contributed a glazed clay plate he calls Bogzarad, said, “Sometimes as a chef people expect you to stay in your lane and not have creative pursuits outside cooking, but that only limits you as a person, and to some extent, as a chef as well.""\n""Sometimes, it’s hard to display works of creativity because there is fear of judgement. But as chefs, we put forward one of the most harshly judged creative mediums daily, so it’s easy to overcome that fear in other creative forms.” \xa0\xa0\n""Sometimes as a chef people expect you to stay in your lane and not have creative pursuits outside cooking, but that only limits you as a person, and to some extent, as a chef as well.""\xa0– Olivier Truesdale-Jutras\nFOOD FROM THE ART\nThe event’s organisers chose The Food Bank Singapore as its beneficiary as the COVID-19 pandemic brought with it a 70 per cent drop in donations. “Operations and distribution activities have also been affected with dwindling volunteer involvement,” said Mathieu Marchal, senior business development manager of Perrier-Nestle Waters Asia Oceania.\xa0\n“Keeping in mind Nestle’s commitment to providing solidarity aid to business partners and communities through the #AlwaysOpenForYouInitiative, we want to do our part to help the vulnerable population by ensuring their most basic needs are taken care of.\n“At the same time, we hope this initiative serves as a reminder for our friends in the food and beverage industry to continue to fuel their passion and express their creativity in the most positive way.”\n""We hope this initiative serves as a reminder for our friends in the food and beverage industry to continue to fuel their passion and express their creativity in the most positive way.""\xa0– Mathieu Marchal\n#LockdownArtists Charity Auction will be held on Saturday, June 20 at 4pm on www.facebook.com/PerrierSG.

      Celebrity chef Jose Andres: ‘I do believe a force for good will take over’ 
  </h1>, 'text': 'It takes Jose Andres three or four tries to appear on screen. Evidently, Washington’s top chef and food philanthropist (he’s distributed millions of meals since the lockdown began) is not as skilled in technology as he is at cooking.\nAfter some good-natured cursing, Andres’s bearded visage eventually pops up. He is sitting outside a restaurant in Virginia Beach, a town with three military bases 338km south of Washington, where his charity, World Central Kitchen, is delivering food.\nThe burly Andres seems larger than life. He is wearing a WCK-branded baseball cap and a green bandana around his neck. But for that and a thick Spanish accent, I could almost mistake him for Santa Claus.\n“You know what happened,” Andres asked. “When I touch my earplug in a Zoom, Siri [Apple’s voice activation service] takes over. It sounds like Siri is jealous because when I touch my ear, she whispers ‘Hey Jose, what do you want?’ ‘Nothing! Leave me alone!’”\nRelieved we have finally connected, I tell Andres I have ordered lunch from one of his offspring outlets – a pop-up Mexican restaurant called Muchas Gracias run by a chef who used to work for him. The eating scene in Washington – and many other cities – is bristling with graduates of Andres’s kitchens. Since the lockdown began, he has been keeping restaurants and food trucks in business by ordering thousands of MREs (meals ready to eat) for his charity.\n“I decided through this pandemic that I will be mainly concentrating on the good things that everybody does because I believe people are going through real hardships.” – Jose Andres\n\n\nAndres has been delivering food to the hungry for more than a decade. He arrived in New York from Spain in 1991 as a young chef with just US$50 (S$69) in his pocket. He had started out catering to a Spanish admiral in Barcelona as part of his military service. Then he worked for the world-renowned chef Ferran Adria at the El Bulli restaurant, where molecular gastronomy was born.\nHe soon found his way to Washington DC, where he co-founded Jaleo, a tapas restaurant that’s credited with bringing Iberian-style small dishes to North America. He now owns restaurants in several cities, including Washington, New York, Las Vegas and Los Angeles. In 2016, his DC restaurant Minibar won a two-star Michelin award – one of three establishments in Washington’s first batch to claim that distinction.\nBeyond the world of fine dining, the 50-year-old chef is better known for his humanitarian relief. When Hurricane Maria pulverised Puerto Rico in 2017, he delivered more than 3.7 million meals across the stricken island – often putting the combined emergency relief of the far larger Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) and American Red Cross to shame. In Yokohama earlier this year, Andres’s charity delivered thousands of meals a day to the COVID-19-hit cruise ship the Diamond Princess.\nI had been warned that no one can tell Andres what or when to eat. A Lunch with the FT in which the subject goes hungry would hardly qualify. I need not have worried. Andres announces he is going to present his lunch to the camera. It looks more like a banquet to me. The first dish is Virginia Beach fried oysters. The second is a plate of ravioli containing ramps – a wild leek found in the nearby Appalachian mountains.\n“I also have this amazing sandwich,” he said, holding up a plate of fries and something meaty-looking mostly concealed under bread. “I think it’s a brisket [one of the least tender cuts of beef, often marinated and cooked slowly].” Finally, he presented a soft-shell crab.\nThough my lunch is delicious, the plate of chicken, rice and refried beans in front of me barely qualifies as a starter. I stab at my food awkwardly, fixing my attention on the computer.\nI tell Andres that the previous evening I had visited my good friend and retired colleague Jurek Martin for a socially distanced beverage on his stoop. It was Jurek’s idea to do a Lunch with Andres. He couldn’t do it himself, he felt, since he was too admiring of Andres’s work to be objective.\nIn addition to Andres’s philanthropy, Washington’s longtime residents fete him for transforming the stodgy dining habits that still prevailed in the city in the early 1990s. America’s capital can now boast one of the country’s foremost restaurant scenes. What was DC food like when Andres turned up, I ask.\nWhile I am teeing up my question, Andres has been making serious inroads into the smorgasbord before him – a bunch of fries here, a bed of oysters there. He demurs on the Washington food scene, listing a number of restaurants that were already there. These included the recently closed Nora, which was America’s first certified fully organic restaurant.\n“If you wanted to use organic toilet paper, you only had to book a table at Nora’s and use the bathroom,” he said. Then there was The Inn at Little Washington in nearby Virginia, which was co-founded in 1978 by Patrick O’Connell. It was already showered with awards.\n“O’Connell was a gay man in rural Virginia fighting prejudice in the middle of nowhere to create one of the most fascinating inns in the world,” said Andres. “What the ****?”\nThree days before our lunch, providence intervened when the FT changed its style guide to permit use of the F-word and other swear words “where necessary, such as in a quote or because they are an integral part of the story”. Without this adjustment, it would be impossible to convey how Andres speaks. In practice, his version sounds much closer to “fock”.\n\n\nAndres is not done with the fine restaurants that came before and after his DC arrival. His citations include some of America’s earliest farmers’ markets and the “Fast Good” movement of organic chains such as Sweetgreen and Cava.\nAs he speaks, he notices I am drinking a margarita that was delivered with my lunch. He applauds ostentatiously. He takes a lusty gulp from a previously hidden balloon-sized glass of white wine. What is that wine, I ask. Andres swills the glass, sniffs it and holds it up to the light. Then he takes a sip. “I think it’s white,” he pronounced.\nI ask him whether restaurants will ever return to what increasingly feels like the culinary golden age before the pandemic. Andres’s charity is almost single-handedly keeping hundreds of outlets alive in Washington, New York, Virginia Beach and dozens of other cities. Every day, WCK delivers tens of thousands of microwaveable meals for the night shifts in hospitals and homeless shelters, to firefighters and other essential workers, and to elderly or incapacitated people who live alone.\nOnce the lockdown is over – whenever that is – many restaurants may never come back to life. The effect of lighter social distancing on standalone restaurants is expected to be brutal; the big chains, in contrast, have more of a financial cushion.\nAndres seems almost pained by the question. “We are going to go back,” he said, after an uncharacteristic pause. “I know a lot say they’re not going to be able to reopen but I argue the contrary. If you are a small business, at the end of the day, you, your wife, your children, a couple of employees, you will be able to open, because you will sacrifice and do whatever it takes seven days a week.”\nAndres could as well be reminiscing about his early days. He points out that his Spanish-born wife and three teenage daughters are helping every day as volunteers in DC. “They only like me for my food,” he said theatrically. Andres is leading a group that is pushing the US Congress to pass a bill – the Feed (Fema Empowering Essential Deliveries) Act – which would expand who qualifies for aid to include victims of COVID-19.\nThe bill would cut through Kafkaesque rules that restrict the ability of Fema to provide the kind of support to restaurants and diners across the US that Andres’s charity is doing privately. It would also make clear that coronavirus is a natural disaster. Fema’s work is normally focused on victims of floods, hurricanes and tornadoes.\nI ask Andres about big producers, such as Tyson, the meat processor, that have closed facilities after coronavirus outbreaks. My question triggers a passionate monologue. To add to the drama, Andres’s audio is temporarily hijacked by the din of fighter jets overhead. He swivels his screen to show three F-15s hurtling past in the sky above.\n“I do believe a force for good will take over afterwards,” he said. “You see these very big companies putting all our eggs in one basket. They are producing so much in one factory and their employees are getting sick. They are underpaid, under-protected and then the entire facility shuts down.”\nHe lists the subsidies Washington pays to America’s big food producers. The supply chains are all geared to them, he said. Millions of gallons of milk are being poured away. Vegetables are rotting in the fields. “What I guarantee is that the small farmers will be driving more of our food [if his bill passes],” he said. “We have to create a diversified farming and food industry in America. Government should not be here to help the big guys that are doing well.”\nAndres is no stranger to controversy. In 2015, he pulled out of a contract to open a restaurant in the about-to-be-launched Trump International Hotel, which sits in the old US postal building a few hundred metres from the White House. When Andres learnt that Donald Trump, who was then an aspiring Republican candidate, had called Mexican immigrants “rapists” and “criminals”, he pulled the plug on the restaurant. After an acrimonious dispute, they settled out of court before Trump took office.\nAndres continued to share his opinion with the American public. “You are full of shit, Sir!” he tweeted after Trump had said there were “fine people” among the neo-Nazi demonstrators in Charlottesville in 2017. “Nothing wrong with the country. Only thing wrong is you and your lies!”\nHow does Andres evaluate Trump’s handling of the coronavirus crisis, I ask. For the first and last time, Andres speaks like a Washingtonian. A word from Trump could kill his bipartisan bill. “I decided through this pandemic that I will be mainly concentrating on the good things that everybody does because I believe people are going through real hardships,” he said.\n“I do believe a force for good will take over afterwards.” – Jose Andres\n\n\nI point out that the alacrity of Andres’s humanitarian operation contrasted with the federal relief effort, which has been patchy at best. He prefers to talk about the failure of leadership everywhere. He says Africa is facing a plague of locusts that could wipe out its crops. Invasive bees are close to destroying America’s native species, which could endanger US food production. Much like today’s pandemic, threats such as these have been flagged globally for years. Yet we do nothing to forestall them.\n“We have generals standing next to presidents in every country, but we don’t see any food experts standing near them,” Andres said. “If governments don’t take care of food security and we leave it to the big private companies, we are going to be in for a very nasty surprise.”\nWe have both finished eating. I suspect that Andres is somewhat fuller than me. He points his camera at Eurasia Cafe’s co-owner David Edelen, who has briefly stepped on to the patio. “I had a feast,” said Andres in mock operatic voice. “I had a feast.”\nBut Andres is not nearly done talking. He tells me his charity has been delivering food to a hotel opposite the United Nations headquarters in New York. Nurses and doctors sleep there to avoid the risk of infecting their families back home. The UN building is empty, he tells me.\n“Maybe they are Zooming or deciding things in meetings online, but I haven’t heard anything they said or did,” he said. “After this pandemic we need to really think about whether humanity is capable of finding real leaders, otherwise we are ******.”\nCan’t he think of one good leader? Andres reflects for a moment. He mentions people outside government, including philanthropic partners in the US and around the world. Then he remembers Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand’s prime minister. “She talked to children about the tooth fairy and the Easter bunny,” he said. “When a leader can give you a message in such a compelling way, you know she is thinking about everything else.”\n“I know a lot say they’re not going to be able to reopen but I argue the contrary. If you are a small business… you will be able to open, because you will sacrifice and do whatever it takes seven days a week.” – Jose Andres\nWe began our lunch mid-afternoon, Catalonia-style. I know Andres has meals to distribute, and funds to raise, before driving back to DC. I ask him a final question. Did he always feel socially conscious? Or did it emerge only after he had succeeded as a restaurateur? “I felt it the moment I began sucking milk from my mother’s breast,” he replied. “In an unconscious way, every single person has knowledge of the world through the maternal nutrition that gives them life.” Rich or poor, we all viscerally feel the importance of food.\n“Sometimes the poor eat better than the rich because they give more value to what they eat and take more pride in special celebrations,” Andres said. He quotes Brillat-Savarin, the 19th-century French culinary thinker: “Tell me what you eat and I will tell you what you are.”\nThe most important meals are the ones we celebrate together, he added. “The whole of America completely stops for Thanksgiving. You feel the power of being surrounded by those you love. Even when the turkey is dry like hell, you will lie to everybody and say it’s the best you have ever eaten.”\nIt is time to press “leave meeting” on my Zoom window. Andres is still talking. I remind him gently that he has other things to do. Why do people say hello or goodbye by bumping their elbows when we are supposed to sneeze in the same place, he asks. “Which moron thought of that?” How do you say hi and goodbye during the pandemic, I ask.\nWithout pause, Andres stands up and bunches his right fist. Then he pounds his chest. “I give you my heart!” he said. “I give you my heart!” It is a strangely moving gesture. I have no doubt Andres is sincere. I part with new–found sympathy for Jurek’s doubts about his objectivity.\nBy Edward Luce © 2020 The Financial Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     food ', '     gastronomy ', '     COVID-19 ', '     relief ']}"

      Dreaming of sushi? Here are eight fine restaurants to satisfy that yearning
  </h1>, 'text': 'Sushi is about so much more than just rice and seafood. It is about shokunin, which loosely translated from Japanese, means the honing of a craft through dogged repetition.\n\n\nIt is about that special exchange of trust between sushi chef and diner, where the former puts his years of toil and experience into each carefully pressed morsel and the latter appreciates this deceptively simple gesture by savouring it in precisely the way he or she is told to do so.\nBut what happens when a pandemic dictates the tethering of this tangible connection?\nTo keep their businesses going and their regulars sated, sushi masters have adapted their craft so that their food can be enjoyed outside of their restaurants.\nThis calls for even more trust – trust that the seafood is fresh enough to withstand some travel in our tropical temperatures and trust that the diners will consume their sushi within a short, specified time frame. Trust, also, that diners understand that eating sushi, made by a wizened master or otherwise, is never the same exquisite experience without that integral personal connection.\nThat said, here are some fine sushi purveyors offering their wares for consumption at home.\n\n\nAKASHI\nIf these were ordinary times, the Goh family would be celebrating Akashi’s 25th year in business with a jolly old bash, their loyal customers and countless bottles of sake in tow.\nAlas, the celebrations will have to wait, but that hasn’t stopped this stalwart from offering their signature dishes for takeout (akashi.oddle.me/en_SG) at happily reasonable prices.\nSushi starts from S$33.80 for a 10-piece set comprising ocean-fresh slivers of the likes of yellowtail, sweet shrimp and tuna, and goes up to S$76.80 for a set of 18 delicious morsels.\nRegulars who grew up on a steady diet of Akashi’s offerings will appreciate the Reverse California Roll (S$14.80), with its lavish crown of flying fish roe. More decadent treats include Bafun Uni Sushi (S$52.80 for three pieces) and Aburi Foie Gras with Uni (S$30.80 for three). Islandwide delivery costs S$6.99 or is complimentary with a minimum order of S$50.\nAKIRA BACK\nThere is nothing traditional about the sushi here, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t irresistibly divine. Great for those who prefer cooked seafood, Akira Back’s takeout sushi (jwmarriottsg.oddle.me/en_SG) includes the Perfect Storm (S$25), comprising crisp shrimp tempura, torched salmon, cucumber and chipotle mayo, and the Green Monster (S$23), a veggie-friendly roll draped with avocado and cream cheese.\nOur personal favourite: Brother From Another Mother (S$25), stacked with grilled unagi (freshwater eel), anago (sea eel) tempura, shaved foie gras torchon, and a rich blanket of ponzu mayo.\nASHINO\nChef-owner Taku Ashino’s deft way with aging fish is renowned. Sushi at this austere restaurant is always deeply flavoured and with interesting textures that result from longer preservation of the fish before it is served.\nIf you’re feeling fancy or festive, Ashino is celebrating its fifth anniversary with a Seasonal Special Don (S$255, enough for “1.5 pax”). For something not-so-decadent but exceedingly tasty, try the S$75 Barachirashi.\nThe appetisers here are also worth a gander. At S$175 for two people, you get the likes of flavour-packed homemade mentaiko (spicy cod roe), steamed abalone, firefly squid and lots more.\nTo order, WhatsApp 8318 3334 at least two hours in advance.\nGINZA SUSHI ICHI\nYou may not be able to roam the islands of Hokkaido, but you can certainly get a taste of them with this Michelin-starred restaurant’s Kegani Bento (S$130), laden with sweet crabmeat, ikura, uni and various cuts of tuna.\nThe Special Nigiri Sushi Set is great value for money at S$80. It comes with seven pieces of sushi, six pieces of rolled sushi, and tamago (Japanese omelette). To order, call 6235 5514 or WhatsApp 8878 1250.\nKISHO\nDistinctive craftsmanship defines Kisho’s exquisite cuisine (ki-sho.com.sg/menu) and is evident even in the disposable boxes that the restaurant now must serve its food in.\nFor true luxury, ask for the Weekly Treasure Box (S$288), richly adorned with lush slivers of the freshest catch from the week. These might include abalone, sea urchin, tuna belly, scallops, and come with a dollop of caviar, an umami abalone broth and liver sauce for good measure.\nThe Omega Bakudan Don (S$130) makes a fine case for eating your fish oils. Heaped on a bed of well-seasoned rice are plump slices of otoro (Bluefin tuna belly), bafun uni from Hokkaido, shoyu-steeped ikura and a marinated organic egg.\nThere are also assorted tuna rolls on offer, from S$70. Call 6733 5251 or WhatsApp 9061 6109 for orders.\nNISHIKANE\nSixth-generation sushi chef Nobuhiro Nishi makes a mean Saba Bo-Sushi (S$60), in which cured Japanese mackerel is pressed with top grade sushi rice.\nHis signature Chirashi Don (S$120, serves two) is an alluring sight; a mosaic of Bluefin tuna, marinated salmon roe, anago and other delights from Toyosu Fish Market in Tokyo set on a bed of shari-flavoured rice.\nBut it is his Nodoguro Uni Donabe (S$100) that’ll leave a warm sense of satisfaction in your belly. Flecked with pieces of nodoguro (black perch), the rice is cooked in a traditional clay pot over high heat so that the tasty oils from the fish flavours the grains as they cook, imbuing them with a briny, savoury depth. Carefully laid coral tongues of uni on the dish’s surface complete the decadence. To order, WhatsApp 9117 6264 at least an hour ahead.\nSHINJI\nThis posh and popular sushi-ya has made some excellent sushi designed for enjoyment at home (shinjibykanesaka.com/online-ordering), at prices you wouldn’t enjoy if you dined at the restaurant.\nA dozen pieces of nigiri sushi made with unimpeachable seafood and rice seasoned with a pronounced lilt of vinegar will set you back S$160. The Nama Chirashi (S$140) sees rice and seafood presented in separate compartments; expect delights like uni, botan ebi (botan shrimp), otoro, shima aji (yellow jack) and cherry trout.\nIf you’re in for a splurge, there’s a S$200 Special Chirashi – a deluxe box blanketed with sea urchin, salmon roe, minced fatty tuna and a dollop of caviar to get the good times rolling.\nSUSHI KIMURA\nThis 22-seater sushi-ya was among the first fine-dining establishments to adapt its sushi for takeaway when the circuit breaker hit.\nChef-owner Tomo Kimura’s Toro Taku Rolls (S$50) are a joy to eat, with unctuous negitoro and crunchy pickled radish tucked between impeccably seasoned shari rice enrobed in a glossy sheet of nori.\nThe Premium Sushi Set (S$88) is excellent, with beautifully formed nuggets of pressed rice topped with luscious slivers of things like Japanese red snapper, sea robin, tuna, sweet squid and prawns.\nLook out for limited specials such as Kamasu Bou (long red tail snapper) Sushi for S$45 each (of which only 10 sets were available), which naturally, sell out fast. To order, WhatsApp 8428 0073.\n', 'related_topics': ['     food ', '     gastronomy ', '     Japan ', '     Singapore ', '     delivery ', '     Fine dining ']}"

      Singapore’s healthcare heroes pick their favourite food takeaways and deliveries
  </h1>, 'text': 'Food, Singapore’s national passion, is a source of comfort and joy for many, especially during the past few months. No surprises, then, that our heroic doctors, many of whom are at the frontlines of the coronavirus battle, are seeking respite in a warm, hearty meal too.\nPlus, every takeaway meal counts in helping to keep the businesses in our vibrant food industry going during these tough times. CNA Luxury picks the brains of seven doctors in Singapore to find out which F&B outlets are on their speed dial when they need a dose of nourishment for their bodies and minds.\n\n\nDR JADE KUA, PEDIATRIC EMERGENCY SPECIALIST\n“Food is my language of love. When the circuit breaker kicked in, I realised that the mood among small businesses was low. At the same time, I was aware that there were friends and donors who wanted to buy healthcare workers a meal. When I was recently in quarantine, I was in a position to connect the dots and matched donors to F&B businesses to coordinate food drops to healthcare workers.\nAs I didn’t want to turn physical isolation into social isolation, I began using Instagram Live to share where the food was being sent to and word began to spread. Now that I am back at work full time, I just do referrals as there are other movements that are helping with this. It is lovely how so many like-minded people are reaching out.”\nHer favourites:\n\n\nDR LOH MAY-HAN, CONSULTANT AND OBSTETRIC ANAESTHESIA LEAD, AND DR ADRIAN NG, CONSULTANT ANAESTHESIOLOGIST\nDr Loh provides anaesthetic and peri-operative care and she has been involved in the multi-disciplinary workflow planning and management of COVID-19 positive pregnant patients. She recently published a clinical opinion paper on this topic in a medical journal. She is also the undergraduate medical education director and assistant professor of Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore and is involved in planning how medical students may resume clinical training safely.\nDr Ng takes care of patients in the peri-operative period who require anaesthesia or sedation for their procedures or surgeries. Medical emergencies still occur during this period and anaesthesiologists get called in to provide anaesthesia, sedation or intensive care support where necessary.\n“Food is not simply a means of sustenance, it also provides comfort. We look forward to meal times where we enjoy not just the partaking of food but also the time spent together. We have always supported our lively local F&B scene – even before this crisis – through eating out or doing takeaways almost every day. An interesting point is that the online selection and variety of food is much greater these days as a result of more restaurants and food outlets pivoting to food delivery and take-outs – it is always good to have more choices.”\nTheir favourites:\n\n\nDR KAREN SOH, MEDICAL DIRECTOR\nPrive Clinic’s Dr Soh has been volunteering with HealthServe to care for migrant workers who live outside the dormitories and who need medical attention.\n“When the circuit breaker first started, there was a great need to look after the food and basic needs of the migrant workers. I worked with Hope Initiative Alliance and Alliance of Guest Workers Outreach to raise funds to pay for meals that were delivered to the dormitories when they were designated as isolation areas and the migrant workers were not allowed to go out to buy food or groceries.

During the circuit breaker, I was introduced to food from all corners of Singapore by relatives and friends. It has been hard not going out with friends, so we’ve been meeting up for Zoom dinners and ordering our favourite food for each other. I also want to support my friends in healthcare, especially those who live by themselves, who hardly have the time or energy to cook after a long day at work – so I’ve been sending them meals or goodies (or both).

      Singapore fishery ports to be consolidated amid review of fresh food wholesale industry
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Singapore consumers will be able to buy wholesale seafood at a single location in several years\' time, amid a consolidation of the country\'s fishery ports.\nThis was announced on Friday (Jun 5) by the Singapore Food Agency (SFA), which is also embarking on a study of the fresh food wholesale sector in Singapore.\nThe study will commence in the third quarter of this year, and will cover both the seafood and vegetable and fruits industries.\nIt will help the agency better understand the distribution, wholesale and retail of fresh food in Singapore, as well as the technology and infrastructure needed to support the sector, SFA said.\nAmong other things, the study will examine how technology such as automation, upstream processing, online platforms, sensors, data analytics, integrated logistics, as well as evolving consumer and business preferences might impact future business models, said SFA in a media release.\nThe study is expected to be completed in 2022, and the findings will be taken into consideration in the Government’s review of the fresh food wholesale industry.\nCONSOLIDATION OF FISHERY PORTS\nSFA also said on Friday that Jurong Fishery Port and Senoko Fishery Port will be consolidated by 2023.\nThe consolidation was decided\xa0following years of declining patronage at Senoko Fishery Port, said SFA, adding that the volume of seafood handled there has dropped by 62 per cent from 15,190 tonnes in 2000 to 5,749 tonnes in 2018.\n""This consolidation of the fishery ports will centralise wholesale seafood in Singapore and allow buyers to purchase seafood wholesale conveniently at a single location,"" said SFA.\n""The move will also offer opportunities for merchants to expand their customer base and increase the vibrancy of trade at Jurong Fishery Port,"" the agency said.\nRENOVATION OF JURONG FISHERY PORT\nMerchants at Senoko Fishery Port will be offered a market lot at the Jurong Fishery Port, which will be renovated with additional lots built.\nRenovation at\xa0Jurong Fishery Port will begin in the first half of 2022, with works to include the resurfacing of market lots and corridors, painting works, re-wiring, and re-roofing.

      Virus threatens Chinese traditions of chopsticks and family-style meals
  </h1>, 'text': 'At Chilli Kitchen in Beijing, spicy and mouth-numbing Sichuan dishes are laid out family-style. Using red chopsticks, diners dive into steaming bowls of pork wontons bathed in fragrant chili oil and sesame seeds, and rummage through platters filled with dried red chili peppers to unearth juicy bits of roasted fish.\n\n\nSharing food is a central feature of how Chinese people, like many elsewhere in the world, convey affection. Parents pick up choice morsels and place them in their children’s bowls as an expression of love; children serve their grandparents to show their respect; and bosses do it as a gesture of magnanimity toward their employees.\nNow, concerns are growing that the country’s long tradition of sharing food could also accelerate the spread of the coronavirus. The government has zeroed in on a ubiquitous utensil: Chopsticks.\nMost Chinese diners pick up food from communal platters with the same pair of chopsticks that they then use to eat, or serve others. Double dipping is the norm. But the government hopes to change habits by urging people to use a second pair of chopsticks – just for serving.\nState news agencies are calling it a “dining table revolution.” Dr Zhong Nanshan and Dr Zhang Wenhong, outspoken infectious disease experts who have become celebrities since the start of the outbreak, have voiced their support. Authorities across the country are running advertisements with slogans like, “The distance between you and civilised dining is just one pair of serving chopsticks.”\nSome restaurants and diners have heeded the call. They are offering discounts to diners who use serving chopsticks. In the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou, more than 100 prominent restaurants have formed a “Serving Chopsticks Alliance.”\nIn Beijing, Bai Yiwen, one of the owners of Chilli Kitchen, reckons that since reopening in mid-April, more than half the groups that come to his restaurants have asked for serving chopsticks, up from less than five per cent before the pandemic.\n“Before, people felt like using serving chopsticks was bothersome,” Bai, 31, said. “But now, everyone is becoming more aware of the problem and slowly they are getting used to it.”\n\n\nAN EXPRESSION OF COMMUNAL CULTURE\nStill, resistance is strong. Many see sharing food with one’s own chopsticks as among the most authentic expressions of China’s communal culture and emphasis on family, no less integral than hugging is to Americans or the cheek kiss is to the French. Serving chopsticks are typically associated with formal settings, like banquets and meals with strangers.\nServing chopsticks are more common in major cities like Beijing and Shanghai, where there is a greater awareness of hygiene. Some Chinese who hail from north of the Yangtze River see their southern, rice-eating counterparts as more particular about their eating habits, and so more likely to use serving chopsticks. (There is no evidence supporting this stereotype.)\nBy contrast, wheat-eating northerners, and particularly the men, take pride in what Chinese call “eating big and drinking big,” without care for such petty concerns as germs and bacteria. Never mind a small, recent experiment by government experts who found that the level of bacteria in dishes for which serving chopsticks were used was as little as 0.4 per cent the level of dishes shared in the regular fashion.\nLiu Peng, 32, an education consultant and proud northerner from the coastal city of Qingdao, said that while he had grown accustomed to wearing a mask in recent months, he and his friends had not changed their dining habits.\n“Maybe using serving chopsticks is more hygienic but eating is the time for us all to relax, and we don’t want to be bothered by all these little rules,” Liu said.\nBesides, he reasoned, the new coronavirus was so contagious that serving chopsticks were not going to stop the virus from spreading around a table.\n“In my 30 years of eating out, I’ve never contracted an infection,” he declared.\nELSEWHERE IN ASIA\nSimilar campaigns to promote serving chopsticks were launched across Asia after the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, in the early 2000s.\nThe drive gained traction in Hong Kong, where nearly 300 people died in that outbreak. Even today, many restaurants in Hong Kong lay two sets of chopsticks at each place setting, one pair for serving and another, often a different-coloured pair, for eating. Other restaurants in the city often place serving spoons and chopsticks directly on the dishes.\nBut the campaign barely registered in mainland China. Most Chinese grow up learning the basics of chopstick etiquette: Hold them two-thirds of the way up; don’t stick them vertically into your rice bowl because it resembles incense offerings for the deceased; and don’t suck on them.\nSharing food with family and friends is just as deeply ingrained, and serving chopsticks are sometimes seen as undermining that expression of closeness. Just asking for the extra utensils can be awkward because it could imply that you think your fellow diners might be unwell.\nSara Jane Ho, a Hong Kong native and founder of a high-end etiquette school in China, said that when she hosts a meal, she often says she has a small cold so she can ask for serving chopsticks to protect everyone else from her.\nBut even then, she said, compliance is not guaranteed.\n“Often you’ll see people serving themselves and then they forget to switch chopsticks and start eating directly with the serving pair,” Ho said. “It always gives me a mini heart attack.”\nHISTORICAL PRECEDENTS\nTo make the government’s case, state media and culinary historians have scoured Chinese history to find instances in which serving chopsticks or individual plating was the norm. For 3,000 years up until the Tang Dynasty, news reports say, Chinese people ate separate portions of food. The articles point to the famous 10th-century scroll painting, The Night Revels of Han Xizai, which depicts a government minister and his guests eating individually plated portions of food.\nThe cause was taken up by Wu Lien-teh, a Chinese doctor from British Malaya, who is often credited with saving many lives during the 1910 outbreak of pneumonic plague in northeastern China. Wu helped popularise the use of serving chopsticks along with the use of a lazy Susan, the round rotating platform known in Chinese as the “hygienic table.”\nEven former Communist Chairman Mao Zedong, who supposedly rarely bathed and never brushed his teeth, was at one point said to have used serving chopsticks, thanks to the influence of the father of Mao’s second wife, according to Zhao Rongguang, a Chinese food historian.\nBut the practice of sharing food has nonetheless persisted. In 1984, Hu Yaobang, then general secretary of the Communist Party and a passionate liberaliser, suggested that his countrymen abandon chopsticks and communal eating in favour of Western-style individual dining practices to avoid contagious diseases. The idea was promptly ignored and forgotten.\nZhao, the historian, sees the coronavirus epidemic as an opportunity to revive the movement for “civilised dining.”\n“If we don’t change this practice of ‘using one pair of chopsticks to dig to the bottom’ then we are going to be eliminated forever by humanity and natural selection,” Zhao said.\nBut unless a specific law is enacted, changing habits will be an uphill battle, particularly outside of the big cities.\nFor Shu Xiao, 27, a schoolteacher in Yuxi, a city in the southwestern province of Yunnan, group dinners can be discomfiting. Shu said her family has used serving chopsticks at home since last year, when reports were circulating about a local outbreak of stomach bacteria.\nWhen she goes out to dinner with her friends, she can’t muster the courage to ask for extra sets of chopsticks, she said. Instead, she tries to eat only from the parts of the dishes least touched by her companions and fights the urge to think about how much bacteria is being circulated around the table.\n“My friends already think my family is kind of strange for using serving chopsticks at home,” she said. “So I just go along with the mainstream, even though in my heart I’m always protesting a little.”\nBy Amy Qin © 2020 The New York Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     dining ', '     food ', '     Family ']}"

At this point in Singaporeans’ collective efforts to stay home, even the most avid home chefs are probably feeling exhausted from cooking so frequently.\nAnd while there is now a plethora of F&B outlets offering delivery and takeaway service, the overwhelming range of choices are likely to cause decision fatigue even if you are a diehard gourmand.\nAs we await the day that restaurants, cafes and bars can safely reopen for dining-in, there is one hassle-free option to consider – food subscription services.\nConsider them the modern day version of old-school “tingkat” deliveries that would drop off home-cooked meals in a metal container. These days, you can get curated restaurant-style bento boxes, halal options and even diet-specific ones such as ketogenic-friendly meals, sent right to your doorstep.\nMost providers also offer different plans, so you can decide on the frequency of your provided meals, in case you prefer to fit in some spontaneous meals when the mood strikes. Here are six food subscription services to check out.\nFOR A DIFFERENT RESTAURANT MEAL EVERY DAY: THE FOODIST\nThis homegrown bento box platform started out by curating premium, restaurant-made sets for swanky corporate events. Now, the company is bringing quality meals to customers through its meal subscription service, which includes options from popular restaurants like New Ubin Seafood, Plentyfull, Sawadee Thai Cuisine and Peach Garden.\nBest of all, The Foodist makes it a point to offer meals from different F&B outlets every day of the week, making this as close to eating from different establishments on a daily basis as it can get for now. Besides single or duo options, there are also family-style sharing platters for those who need to keep multiple mouths fed.\nFOR FITNESS JUNKIES: KETOMEI\nIf you are finding it hard to stick to your #fitspo goals at home with all the junk food beckoning from your fridge, Ketomei might be the solution. It focuses on low-carbohydrate and high-fat ketogenic-compliant meals, a popular diet for the health and fitness-obsessed.\nThe meals are planned in consultation with a nutrition and health coach and prepared by chef Andrew Ng, who has previously helmed the kitchens of The University Club and Wildfire Burgers.\nFor variety, the menu includes a mix of European and Asian fusion meals, with unique offerings such as chicken “rice” made with cauliflower, Korean Bulgogi and Masala barramundi.

Helmed by executive chefs Karl Dobler and Eugenia Ong, who have a combined 60 years experience in the F&B industry, their meals offer the best of both worlds with authentic European and Asian-Indonesian meals.\nThe tingkat menus, which are inspired by the chefs’ supply of fresh produce, are refreshed weekly with each evening’s food drop comprising a soup and three dishes. Expect a good mix of comforting fare such as double-boiled chicken soup, Hainanese pork chop and grilled dory fillet.\nFOR FINE CHINESE CUISINE: PARADISE TEOCHEW \nPopular Chinese restaurant chain Paradise Group is offering fancy family meals for those who miss the pomp of dining out in a fine restaurant.

In the BC (before COVID-19) days, cousins Aidah and Zakiah launched the cafe to provide clean food and fresh-pressed juices to the community in the Arab Street area.\nThese days, customers can feast on their brand of low-carb or plant-based food via Limaa’s newly-launched meal plans. The meals are a mix of Asian, Western and sometimes fusion cuisine, but what looks most interesting are their interpretations of signature Malay/Indonesian food such as nasi lemak made with cauliflower rice or Avo-gado gado.\nFOR CALORIE COUNTERS: AMGD\nThose with very precise nutritional needs or who are counting their calories for health reasons will appreciate the detail that goes into each item on the AMGD menu.\nThe food subscription site has an extensive list of bento boxes that cater to various permutations of dietary preferences, such as low-carb high-protein or high-carb low-fat meals.\nEach meal also includes a calorie count and a breakdown of the macronutrients.

      For the loaf of bread: Where to get the best artisanal bakes in Singapore
  </h1>, 'text': 'Among the many joys of staying home is the act of hugging a loaf of fragrant, crusty bread in your comfiest clothes and scarfing it down like no one’s watching.\nThanks to the boulangerie boom of the past few years, Singaporeans are no strangers to the gentle tang of hearty sourdough loaves, Japanese-style cottony baguettes, and rustic whole grain boules upon which we can channel our deepest comfort-sandwich desires.\nWhether it’s an Insta-worthy avocado on toast (add an artful sprinkling of dukkah for extra likes), a good-old grilled cheese sandwich, or a fat hoagie dripping with mayo, the breads from these fine bakeries and restaurants make excellent vehicles to hold your favourite ingredients together.\nOf course, there is something to be said for the soul-soothing comfort of a cold pat of good salted butter on a warm slice of toast. Pull on your PJs, because there’s no better time than now to go on that bread binge.\n\n\nBAKERY BRERA\nThis neighbourhood gem is synonymous with their standout cruffins, but the stalwarts of their range are ambrosial offerings like crispy baguettes (S$4.20), pain au levain (S$8.50) and walnut onion bread (S$5.50).\nTo keep the crowds at bay during the Circuit Breaker, Bakery Brera has set up an online platform where customers can pre-order their bakes for queue-free, contactless collection.\nWe never leave without a quartet of their rich and fluffy chocolate hot cross buns (S$8), which are available all year round.\nBAKEHAUS\nBakehaus’ 10-year-old sourdough starter, Ace, boasts the honour of having a piece of him living in the Puratos Sourdough Library in Belgium.\nHere in Singapore, he contributes to the bakery’s popular pain au levain (S$8) and a rather special brown butter polenta loaf (S$10). Those feeding a large, bread-loving family will benefit from the bread and pastry bundles that start at S$55 for a loaf of rustic white sourdough, whole wheat sourdough, nine-grain sourdough, traditional baguette, pain de mie, 250g of salted French butter, and a specially selected soft cheese.\nAdd S$12 to that and you’ll also get a pair of croissants and two pain au chocolat. Order through the Bakehaus Facebook or Instagram pages.\nBURNT ENDS \nBuying bread from Burnt Ends used to feel like an insider exclusive. This popular restaurant had been selling its rye and wholemeal-blend loaves to regular diners on an ad hoc basis and was working on an online bakery before the Circuit Breaker hit.\nCue the mad dash to redefine its business model and bread has evolved to become a regular item on its takeaway menu, much to the delight of anyone who’s tasted one of their rustic, aromatic loaves. Using a 14-year-old starter whose claim to fame is that it was made by the baker who established the bread programme at Noma, Burnt Ends’ sourdough loaves (S$12.90) call for a 72-hour notice, with pick up between 12pm to 5pm daily. While you’re at it, might as well pick up a couple of chocolate or jam donuts too.\nFIREBAKE\nDense, old-soul breads fly out of the impressive hand-forged wood-fire ovens at this East Coast bakery.\nPick up one of their six sourdough loaves – we adore the white-and-rye Valley loaf (S$13), richly studded with dried fruit and scented with cinnamon and honey – or their croissant-esque buns flavoured with the likes of chocolate or cheese and marmite (S$4.50 each), that are available on weekends.\nIf you need a sampler before you go in for a whole loaf, order the bread board (S$10) of five assorted slices that comes with a good pat of French butter and Greek extra virgin olive oil.\nMICRO BAKERY & KITCHEN \nTheir beautifully formed country loaves (S$9) are mildly tangy with an airy crumb, but the flavoured breads are the stars at this hole-in-the-wall bakery, whose second branch sits in the historical Red House along Katong.\nTry the herb olive oil focaccia (S$10) or the lovely kanelbullar (S$10 for two), a sweet sourdough twisted bun enriched with cardamom and milk.\nMOTHER DOUGH \nAlready exceedingly popular, the circuit breaker has propelled demand for sourdough loaves and croissants at this jewel box of a bakery.\nInstead of a regular menu, bakes are posted on Mother Dough’s Instagram stories two days before they are available, while orders are taken a day in advance via WhatsApp.\nCheck out the sourdough baguettes (S$3.80) and the five-seed rye loaves (S$12) that take a good 24-hours to rise and ferment in the chiller, giving them great structure and nuanced flavour.\nAnyone who’s ever bitten into one of Mother Dough’s sourdough croissants (S$4) would also advise that you reserve a batch of those as well. Weekends bring with them special treats like olive and cheddar whole wheat bread (S$10) and butter sourdough brioche (S$8).\nNOURI\nNouri’s crusty rye loaf served with soft-set nutmeg cheese and warm vegetable broth always felt like a nourishing start to what never failed to be a mind-blowing meal.\nThis same soul-soothing combination (S$24) is available for takeaway on the restaurant’s online store, which purveys easy-to-appreciate dishes, fresh produce from its farm in Cameron Highland, and of course, bread.\nNouri’s no-knead, slow-ferment sourdough loaf (S$16) is one for those who love an ethereal lightness in the bread’s crumb and crust, with just the barest hint of a tang. Fun fact: Their starter named Shella was born with a bit of pineapple added to it and has been donated to several restaurants in Singapore who now have their own popular bread programmes.\nSALTED & HUNG\nYou won’t find a whole hunk of Salted & Hung’s utterly delicious sourdough loaf (S$15) on its delivery menu, but if you call the restaurant to order two days in advance, you’ll be amply rewarded.\nThe loaves’ friable crusts shatter with a cheerful crisp while their feathery insides hold that gorgeously delicate perfume of flour and natural yeasts. For a “lighter” option, go for the mini loaf that comes with kelp butter and whipped lard (S$8). Word of advice: You’d do well to order two portions… just in case.\nSTARTER LAB \nThis Balinese import’s San Francisco-style sourdoughs come in a lip-smacking array, including the rugged, blistered country loaves (S$10) made with 25 per cent whole wheat and slender miso baguettes (S$6) with a sharp tang and chewy cracker-like crust.\nThe rosemary, lemon and sea salt white loaf (S$10) is a joy to eat – squishy within, boldly salted and encased in a fine crackly crust. Order here.\nTIONG BAHRU BAKERY\nGolden crusts, chewy crumbs and deep flavours characterise Tiong Bahru Bakery’s sourdough (S$7), a fine all-purpose loaf that is as good eaten on its own or dipped in a bowl of soup when the weather calls for it.\nFor added fibre and flavour, go for the rye sourdough (S$8.50) or the rye cereal sourdough (S$8.50) with its mix of sesame, flax seeds and sunflower seeds. Also available for takeaway, the Liege waffles (S$23), made from a 158-year old sourdough starter, make for a hearty meal with bacon, maple syrup and ricotta, if you have calories to burn.\n', 'related_topics': ['     food ', '     Singapore ', '     gastronomy ', '     Fine dining ']}"

      The Singaporeans helping to save the F&amp;B industry, one online order at a time
  </h1>, 'text': 'When Jonathan Lim and Alan Goh were asking restaurants in the Telok Ayer district whether they needed an online ordering system in 2013, little did they know that the Oddle online ordering platform they would eventually develop would become a life-saving tool for Singapore’s food and beverage (F&B) industry in a crisis.\n\n\n“I was also running a restaurant then and we were taking big orders by pen and paper. It was time-consuming, and information would get mixed-up,” said Lim. “I looked around for a delivery system and was shocked to receive a quote for S$300,000. So I decided to do it myself.”\nHe banded together with two other secondary schoolmates, including Goh, to start Oddle – a cheeky play on the word “order” – in 2014. To date, it is used by nearly 3,000 F&B brands spread across Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan and Hong Kong, including 800 brands locally.\nSince April, the team has been working round the clock as an avalanche of 300 to 400 new restaurants have signed up with them, compared to the average of 40 to 50 per month they would get pre-pandemic.\n“The big brands realise that there’s money to be made but they need a system. As we onboarded many restaurants quickly, we realised this is no longer just about making money, but saving F&B as an industry,” shared Lim.\nOddle operates on a pay-on-performance model, where the company takes a 10 per cent commission of actual online sales. For example, if a restaurant offers a 20 per cent discount on a S$100 item, Oddle takes S$8, which includes a 3.5 per cent fee given to the payment gateway. Goh, who is Oddle’s global sales lead, said: “This makes us co-partners and we make sure you do well.\n“Oddle was initially launched for the sole purpose of providing a technological solution for restaurants to have their own platform to capture organic sales. As time went by, we realised they don’t have the logistics manpower support. So we found delivery partners in different markets to handle that part of the operations.”\nGoh explained: “Some restaurants are fishing in swimming pools where there’re no fish, while others want to catch sharks in a small pond where there’re only goldfish. We not only sell them the fishing rod, but we teach them how to get the fish they want.\n“During this pandemic, we help them coordinate on the logistics, guide them on service recovery, look deeper into their menu, and advise them on best practices, data management and recommended platform settings.”\nThere has been a significant increase in the number of high-end hotels and restaurants – such as those from Les Amis Group, Unlisted Collection and The Lo & Behold Group – using Oddle for takeaway and delivery orders.\n“This COVID-19 situation is causing them to realise the importance of their customer database, especially in terms of reaching out to their loyal customers. Some are even exploring the possibility of creating a sister brand just for delivery,” Goh shared.\n“As we onboarded many restaurants quickly, we realised this is no longer just about making money, but saving F&B as an industry.” – Jonathan Lim\nPERSPECTIVES FROM THE F&B OPERATORS\nRestaurants and hotels that CNA Luxury spoke to cited ease of use and quick implementation as some of the reasons why they chose Oddle. Most importantly, it was also\xa0 “the most business-friendly” and “has a much more realistic commission scheme”.\nGoodwood Park Hotel’s spokesperson added that Oddle’s marketing functions allow it to offer and communicate promotions to customers, while Andrew Ing, The Lo & Behold Group’s Chief Operations Officer said, “Its group page feature allows us to list all our active venues on one page for diners to discover new options, especially during this circuit breaker period.”\nChef-restaurateur Beppe de Vito of ilLido Group said that Oddle allows it to white-label its own delivery page, which gives better results as visibility is higher. “Being listed on delivery platforms means we’re just one of many fishes in the sea and that’s not sustainable,” he added.\nBut Oddle may not be suitable for every F&B outlet. Unlisted Collection’s CEO Loh Lik Peng felt that the company does not have a well-known, consumer-facing brand like Deliveroo or Grab, “so it works better for businesses that already have a good profile and a good following of loyal clientele”.\nGoh agreed wholeheartedly. “The idea of Oddle is to be the unsung hero behind the scene. It is only meant to be as effective as your brand power. In the virtual world, the winners are those who put effort in branding and marketing. We can help maximise your potential if you already have a well thought-out marketing plan. We can’t guarantee everyone can do well, but at least we can give everyone a fighting chance.”\nThe current pandemic has proven to be the game changer in Lim and Goh’s struggle to digitalise the F&B industry, as that option was hardly on any operator’s radar previously. They are also in the midst of talking to restaurant chains with outlets in the overseas markets Oddle is currently operating in.\nLim said: “For the last six years, we’ve been fighting against the current. With this crisis, the restaurants don’t have a lot of choice in running their businesses, and going digital is the way forward, [it] doesn’t matter whether you’re in Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong or Taiwan. We’re making use of this opportunity to push for F&B businesses to adopt technology and go digital.”\n“We’re making use of this opportunity to push for F&B businesses to adopt technology and go digital.” – Jonathan Lim\n', 'related_topics': ['     food ', '     Restaurants ', '     delivery ', '     Singapore ', '     circuit breaker ', '     Community ']}"

      India's 'superfood' jackfruit goes global
  </h1>, 'text': 'THRISSUR, India: Green, spiky and with a strong, sweet smell, the bulky jackfruit has morphed from a backyard nuisance in India\'s south coast into the meat-substitute darling of vegans and vegetarians in the West.\nPart of the South Asia\'s diet for centuries, jackfruit was so abundant that tonnes of it went to waste every year.\nBut now India, the world\'s biggest producer of jackfruit, is capitalising on its growing popularity as a ""superfood"" meat alternative - touted by chefs from San Francisco to London and Delhi for its pork-like texture when unripe.\n""There are a lot of enquiries from abroad ... At the international level, the interest in jackfruit has grown manifold,"" Varghese Tharakkan tells AFP from his orchard in Kerala\'s Thrissur district.\nThe fruit, which weighs five kg\xa0on average, has a waxy yellow flesh when ripe and is eaten fresh, or used to make cakes, juices, ice creams and crisps.\nWhen unripe, it is added to curries or fried, minced and sauted. In the West, shredded jackfruit has become a popular alternative to pulled pork and is even used as a pizza topping.\n""People love it,"" Anu Bhambri, who owns a chain of restaurants in the US and India, explains.\n""The jackfruit tacos have been a hit at each and every location. The jackfruit cutlet - every table orders it, it\'s one of my favourites!""\nJames Joseph quit his job as a director at Microsoft after spotting Western interest in jackfruit ""gaining momentum as a vegan alternative to meat"".\nJACK OF ALL FRUITS\nThe COVID-19 crisis, Joseph says, has created two spikes in consumer interest.\n""Coronavirus caused a fear for chicken and people switched to tender jackfruit. In Kerala, lockdown caused a surge in demand for mature green jackfruit and seeds due to shortage of vegetables due to border restrictions,"" he explains.\nGlobal interest in veganism was already soaring pre-pandemic, buoyed by movements such as Meat Free Mondays and Veganuary, and with it the business of ""alternative meats"".\nConcerns about health and the environment - a 2019 UN report suggested adopting more of a plant-based diet could help mitigate climate change - mean consumers are turning to brands such as Impossible and Beyond Meat for plant-based replications of chicken, beef, and pork.\nBut they are also using substitutes long popular in Asia such as soy-based tofu and tempeh, and wheat derivative seitan, as well as jackfruit.\nThis boom has meant more and more jackfruit orchards have sprung up in the coastal state.\n""You get a hard bite like meat - that\'s what is gaining popularity and like meat it absorbs the spices,"" comments Joseph.\nHis firm sells jackfruit flour which can be mixed with or used as an alternative to wheat and rice flour to make anything from burger patties to local classics such as idli.\nJoseph worked with Sydney University\'s Glycemic Index Research Service to establish any health benefits.\n""When we did a nutritional analysis, we found jackfruit as a meal is better than rice and roti (bread) for an average person who wants to control his blood sugar,"" he adds.\nIndia has one of the highest diabetes rates in the world and is expected to hit around 100 million cases by 2030, according to a study by The Lancet.\n""SECRETS OF SUCCESS""\nAs global warming wreaks havoc on agriculture, food researchers say jackfruit could emerge as a nutritious staple crop as it is drought-resistant and requires little maintenance.\nTharakkan has not looked back since he switched from growing rubber to jackfruit on his land, and has a variety that he can cultivate year-round.\n""When I cut down my rubber trees everyone thought I had gone crazy. But the same people now come and ask me the secret of my success,"" he smiles.\nIn Tamil Nadu and Kerala alone, demand for jackfruit is now 100 tonnes every day during the peak season yielding a turnover of US$19.8 million a year, says economics professor S. Rajendran of the Gandhigram Rural Institute.\nBut there is rising competition from countries such as Bangladesh and Thailand.\nJackfruit\'s newfound international fame is a massive turnaround for a plant that while used in local dishes, has long been viewed as a poor man\'s fruit.\nEach tree can yield as 150-250 fruits a season.\nIn Kerala, where it is believed to have originated, deriving its name from local word ""chakka"", Tharakkan recalls it was not unusual to see notices in private gardens asking people to take away the fruit for free because they were so plentiful, they would simply rot and attract flies.\nAnd while India\'s jackfruit growers - like the wider agriculture sector - have been hit as the nationwide coronavirus lockdown causes a shortage of labour and transport, international demand shows no sign of slowing.\nSujan Sarkar, the Palo Alto-based executive chef of Bhambri\'s restaurants, believes even meat-eaters are becoming jackfruit converts.\nHe adds: ""It\'s not only vegetarians or vegans, even the meat-eaters, they just love it.""\n', 'related_topics': ['     India ', '     agriculture ', '     food ']}"

      How snacking on comfort foods like chips and cookies can affect your health
  </h1>, 'text': 'In recent weeks, foods of all kinds have flown off the shelves at grocery stores as people stocked up to weather the coronavirus pandemic. But sales of “comfort foods” like potato chips, pretzels, pancake mix and cookies have seen a particularly dramatic surge. That may not be surprising: They are cheap, satisfying and shelf stable.\nUnfortunately, for the many millions of people now sheltered at home, avoiding the urge to make frequent trips to the kitchen throughout the day to snack on these foods can be tricky.\nBut Dr David A. Kessler, a former commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), has a simple message for people who want to keep their metabolic health and weight in check when temptation is just a few steps from their work space: Try to avoid eating foods that contain what he calls “fast carbs,” such as refined grains, starches, corn and sugar.\nThese foods, like bagels, bread, breakfast cereals, juices, tortilla chips and anything made with processed flour, tend to be highly processed and devoid of fibre. They are rapidly absorbed and converted to glucose in the body, causing blood sugar and insulin levels to spike and preventing the release of hormones that quench hunger.\nOver time, researchers have found, this pattern of eating can wreak havoc on metabolic health, leading to weight gain and increasing the risk of Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, conditions that can increase the risk of complications from COVID-19.\nIn his new book Fast Carbs, Slow Carbs, Kessler explores the science behind highly processed carbohydrates and how they affect our physiology.\nIn many ways, Kessler is uniquely attuned to the problems with our modern food supply. During his tenure as commissioner of the FDA from 1990 to 1997, he helped design the nutrition facts label that appears on all packaged foods. After leaving the agency he served as dean of Yale medical school. Then in 2009 he published The End of Overeating, which investigated how processed food companies design products that have powerful effects on the brain, leading people to crave and consume them uncontrollably.\nYet even he is not immune from the problems plaguing many of us. For years he yo-yo dieted and fought to control his weight. To this day he struggles to resist the pull of fast carbs – bagels are his biggest weakness – especially when stress and tensions are high.\nObesity and metabolic disease are complex conditions, driven by a variety of factors, including genetics, environment, diet and lifestyle. But after poring over decades of research and interviewing leading nutrition researchers, Kessler found that one thing most successful diets have in common is that they limit highly processed carbs.\nYet foods that contain these fast carbs have become a mainstay for many people. According to the US federal government, grain-based desserts such as cookies, doughnuts and granola bars are the largest source of calories in the American diet, followed by breads, sugary drinks, pizza, pasta dishes and other processed foods. About 60 per cent to 70 per cent of processed foods contain refined wheat, corn, tapioca, rice, potatoes and other fast carbs as their primary ingredient.\nHumans have been processing foods in various ways for thousands of years, whether cooking, boiling, grinding or milling them. But Kessler argues that the industrial processing of carbs that occurs today has a far more pronounced effect on food than the techniques used by our ancestors.\n“If cooking and milling were early forms of processing,” he writes, “today’s food manufacturing strategies are more aptly called ultraprocessing.”\nMost of the grains that are used in foods like breakfast cereals, corn chips and crackers are milled by high-speed steel rollers. Then they are further pulverised through a variety of high-pressure techniques. One of these is extrusion cooking, a thermal and mechanical process that dramatically alters the chemical structures of grains, breaking down their long chains of glucose into smaller starch molecules that can be rapidly digested.\n“The physical properties of the original starch molecule are no longer the same,” Kessler wrote. “The granule structure has been destroyed, the glucose polymer chains have been reduced in size, and their surface area has expanded, which increases how fast we absorb these foods from our digestive tract into our bloodstream.”\nOur intestines average about 7.6m in length, an evolutionary adaptation that allows us to gradually extract glucose from relatively intact starches as they move through our systems. But processes like extrusion essentially predigest starches for us: They arrive in our stomachs as a soft, porous paste, and the glucose they contain is largely absorbed in the first part of the small intestine beyond the stomach, the duodenum, circumventing the need to travel through the whole digestive tract.\n“Highly processed carbs short-circuit our innate biology,” Kessler wrote. “The laborious series of steps we developed over millennia to digest whole fruits, grains and vegetables through the entire length of the digestive system is undermined.”\n“Highly processed carbs short-circuit our innate biology.” – Dr David A. Kessler\nThis creates a number of metabolic problems.\nSlow carbs like broccoli, beans and brown rice slowly release glucose as they travel through our systems, eventually reaching the lower parts of the gastrointestinal tract. There they trigger a hormone called GLP-1 that tells our bodies we are being fed, resulting in feelings of satiety. But because fast carbs are rapidly absorbed in the upper parts of the digestive tract, they flood our systems with glucose and insulin, the fat-storage hormone, while failing to stimulate GLP-1. As a result, Kessler said, they fail to turn off our hunger switch.\nAt the same time, studies suggest, they elicit a potent neurological response, lighting up the reward centre in the brain in a way that compels people to eat more even when they are not hungry. Processing also affects the amount of calories that we absorb from our food. When we eat a starchy carb that is minimally processed, much of it passes through the small intestine undigested. Then it is either used by bacteria in the colon or excreted. Industrial processing makes more of those calories available to our bodies, which can accelerate weight gain.\nKessler stressed that he is not telling people they should never eat these foods – just to be mindful about what they are and how they affect their health. The less often you eat them, he said, the less you will crave them.\nHe encourages people to follow three steps to improve their health. Limit fast carbs and prioritise slow carbs like beans, legumes, whole grains, nuts, fruits and vegetables. Watch your LDL cholesterol, a strong driver of heart disease, and eat a largely plant-based diet to help lower it if necessary. And lastly, engage in daily exercise to help control your weight and improve your overall metabolic health.\n“When we get through this current epidemic, we are all going to want to be healthy,” he said. “We know what it takes. But doing it is really hard, and we have to work on it.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     food ', '     health ', '     Wellbeing ']}"

      7 kitchen gadgets to get if circuit breaker has turned you into an avid cook
  </h1>, 'text': 'The coronavirus pandemic has forced many of us to take up new hobbies to fill up our time indoors. While some of us are trying out new fitness activities, others are cooking up a storm in the kitchen.\nNow that you’re spending more time whipping up meals or sweet treats, it’s time to draw up a wish list of items for your dream home kitchen. These gadgets and appliances function as the perfect kitchen helpers, helping you to serve up dishes worthy of master chef status.\n\n\nANOVA PRECISION COOKER\nCan’t seem to get the doneness of your steak right? The sous vide technique may have once been limited to professional chefs, but the Anova Precision Cooker will help you cook restaurant-quality steaks in the comfort of home.\nSimply attach the immersion circulator into any pot filled with water, place your food into a sealed bag, secure it to the side of the pot, and set your desired timing and temperature through the Anova App or the device’s manual interface. With the Anova Precision Cooker, you can also sous vide salmon, pork chops and hardboiled eggs.\nBREVILLE SMART OVEN PRO\nThe conventional oven has been a mainstay in every kitchen for years, but for those who don’t cook on a regular basis, it can be a bulky appliance that takes up too much space. Enter the Breville Smart Oven Pro, a countertop convection toaster oven with all the functions you need to whip up a decent dish.\nAn alternative to the traditional oven, the Breville Smart Oven Pro can cook, toast and roast all your favourite food. It comes equipped with Breville’s Element IQ cooking system, which automatically adjusts the oven’s settings to the cooking mode selected. There are a total of ten cooking modes to choose from, namely Bake, Broil, Roast, Warm, Bagel, Cookies, Pizza, Toast, Reheat and Slow Cook.\nKITCHENAID STAND MIXER\nEvery home baker dreams of having a KitchenAid Stand Mixer. Not only does it knead, stir, cream and whip ingredients to perfection, this good-looking appliance, which comes in an array of colours, is also the ultimate countertop showpiece.\nThe KitchenAid Stand Mixer is no one-trick pony either. Beyond making baking a fuss-free affair, a range of attachments is sold to accompany the mixer. These include a pasta roller, ravioli maker, food processor, ice cream maker, juicer and more.\nMARCATO ATLAS 150 PASTAMAKER\nOnce you’ve mastered Italian dishes like spaghetti bolognese and aglio olio, the next step is to make the pasta from scratch. With the Marcato Atlas 150, you can make three different noodle shapes – lasagna, fettucine and taglioni.\nThis traditional chrome-plated machine is available in six colours. It’s also lightweight enough to easily clamp onto the side of your countertop when you need it. There are also 13 interchangeable accessories that allow you to create other pasta shapes, such as linguine, pappardelle, capellini and lasagnette.\nMIELE DIALOG OVEN \nFor beginner cooks, relying on intuition to judge how long your food needs to be cooked simply won’t cut it. What if you had an oven that takes the guesswork out of cooking, and actually “listens” to your food in order to cook it to perfection?\nThe Miele Dialog Oven is the first cooking tool to use electromagnetic waves alongside conventional radiant heat for ultra-precision cooking. It’s able to detect food texture, then decide exactly how much energy is needed to cook it. What this means is you can cook a slab of steak, a rack of lamb and a tray of vegetables all at the same time, and each food item will emerge perfectly cooked.\nSAMSUNG FAMILY HUB \nWe’ve all been there. You’re out grocery shopping, but can’t seem to recall if you’ve got butter, milk or cheese stocked in the fridge. The Samsung Family Hub is equipped with three interior cameras that take snapshots of what’s inside your fridge, which can then be accessed remotely via smartphone.\nThe refrigerator is also equipped with AI features that help with meal planning. It can recommend Smart Recipes based on your preferences, come up with a meal plan for the week based on the ingredients in your fridge, and create grocery shopping lists based on what’s missing.\nThe Family Hub will also entertain you as you cook up a storm. Stream music through the fridge’s built-in speakers, or play your favourite TV shows on the Family Hub’s screen.\nTHERMOMIX\nHere’s a smart gadget that’s been gaining fervour amongst home cooks – the Thermomix, an all-in-one blender that functions as your very own sous chef in gadget form. It’s an extra pair of hands that helps you with everything. It can chop, puree, knead, stir, cook, sous vide and steam your food.\nThe Thermomix comes with two steamer baskets, one that fits into the blender bowl, and another that perches on top. This gadget also has 40,000 pre-loaded step-by-step recipes to expand your cooking repertoire, as well as a built-in scale that measures all your ingredients for you.\n', 'related_topics': ['     food ', '     homes ', '     Singapore ']}"

      A chef’s journey from rural orphanage to head of a high-end hotel restaurant
  </h1>, 'text': 'Five-year-old Nipaporn Doungiaisantisuk took her father’s hand and left their highland village in the Wawee District of Chiang Rai. They were going to visit her new school, he explained, and she followed with a spring in her step, delighted at the prospect of a new adventure.\nAt the school, her father and teachers chatted about her future in words she couldn’t understand since she only spoke the dialect of her Akha hill tribe. When they were done, he told her to wait outside while he went to use the toilet. That was the last she would see of him for an entire year.\n“I waited, had a snack and wondered why he was taking so long. Then evening came and I realised he was gone. He had slipped out from a different exit and I was all alone,” she recalled.\nTuk, as she is now more affectionately known, wailed and stomped her feet as any five-year-old would. Why would her father leave her in this strange place? Did her mother know about this? When was she going home? No one had answers. No one understood her. No one in the orphanage spoke Akha.\n\n\nA post shared by Nathaniel Farouz 高天禮 (@natfarouz)\n“At first I was angry with my parents for sending me away, but as I grew up I realised that they did it because they wanted me to have an education and a good future,” she said.\n“One year later, when my father came to pick me up for my annual visit home, I was so happy to see him that I forgot to be angry and I jumped up to hug him. But over the years, my teachers always remembered my father because he was always late picking me up,” she added cheerfully.\nTuk lived in that orphanage for 12 years, where she quickly learned to speak Thai while receiving an education. She grew so used to life there that by the time she reached secondary school, she barely made the annual trip home to visit her family.\nSchool was engaging enough, but it was kitchen work that really captured her attention. Every day she quietly watched the kitchen come to life as the teachers prepared meals for the children. Once they noticed, the teachers roped her in to help at mealtimes. Tuk grew to become so adept in the kitchen that when guests arrived at the orphanage, her teachers left her in charge of the food.\n“At first I was angry with my parents for sending me away, but as I grew up I realised that they did it because they wanted me to have an education and a good future.” – Nipaporn Doungiaisantisuk\n\n\nON THE GO\nAt university in Chiang Mai, Tuk studied Business English, a wise major for a future designed to blossom beyond the confines of provincial Thailand. Yet a restlessness pervaded her academic endeavours.\n“I began to see that if I only studied English, this would be the rest of my life,” she said, pressing her arms rigidly to her side to suggest standing stock still. “But if I learnt to cook, then I would be in motion, which is how I like to be.”\nDuring her third year of university, she enrolled at Chiang Mai Thai Cookery School and spent any free time she had outside of both schools working at a restaurant to pay off her student loans. She got a job at her cookery school after graduating, accompanying English-speaking tourists on morning market tours and teaching them how to make classic Thai dishes.\nThree years later, she went to work for a government school where many students came from surrounding hill tribes, just like she did. There, she planned meals and headed quality control, but more than that, she was a constant comforting presence for the young children whom she understood deeply.\n“The other teachers were married so they went home at the end of the day,” she explained. “I am single so I stayed in the school with the kids. I loved them very much because they were a mirror to my childhood. I knew how to treat them and communicate with them.”\nAfter two years, Tuk finally returned home to her family in Akha to help an aunt open a hill tribe store. One fateful day, a customer she was chatting with mentioned that he was opening a Thai restaurant in Malaysia and was looking to hire a native chef.\n“I said I was interested, even though I didn’t have restaurant experience,” she said. They kept in touch by email and before long, she landed a job as a kitchen helper at Tamarind Hill in Kuala Lumpur in 2008.\nA WORLD AWAY\nTuk’s is not the typical life trajectory of a woman from a Thai hill tribe. Many go on to marry and have families, and then devote themselves to caring for them. Her own mother woke at 4am every day to make a fire, prepare breakfast, feed the animals and pound rice with her feet, all with a baby boy strapped to her chest. The rest of the day was spent bent over in the paddy fields tending to the rice and corn.\n“I am not married because I have a bad attitude,” Tuk, now 39, said half-jokingly. “Even though I was so young, I always wondered why my mother did all this on her own. Why did no one help her? But this is just how it is.”\nTuk’s earliest food memories are of making nam prik pao or chilli paste in the pre-dawn hours with her mother, pounding the chillies, garlic and tomatoes with a mortar and pestle, which they would eat with hot steamed rice and vegetables throughout the day. This combination of rice, spice paste and boiled vegetables remains her favourite food, a warm comfort at the end of a busy day in her restaurant kitchen.\nNow the Thai Speciality Chef at Park Hotel Farrer Park, where she helms Thai restaurant Blue Jasmine, Tuk parlays her childhood memories and culinary experience to a menu of Thai classics that span the regions of her home country. “There are not many Thai restaurants in Singapore’s hotels, so I hope that I bring a real taste of Thailand to visitors here,” she said.\n\n\nWhile she admits to not feeling at home in Chiang Rai having moved away at such a young age, she says that it is still where she will retire.\n“My family is there. I wouldn’t say I’m very close to my parents and siblings, but they are my family. I have bought a house and some land there, so hopefully one day, I will go home and open a small business and spend time with my family. But while I have the energy now, I want to do and learn more.”\nTill then, the flavours of this plucky 39-year-old’s life experiences will continue to spice up the menu that is currently available for takeaway while the ""circuit breaker"" keeps us at home.\n“I wouldn’t say I’m very close to my parents and siblings, but they are my family. I have bought a house and some land there, so hopefully one day, I will go home and open a small business and spend time with my family.” – Nipaporn Doungiaisantisuk\n', 'related_topics': ['     food ', '     gastronomy ', '     Restaurants ', '     Singapore ', '     Chefs ', '     Thailand ', '     Profiles ']}"

      Growing food in the heartlands: SFA launches tender for rooftop farming sites at HDB car parks
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: People living in Housing and Development Board (HDB) estates from Tampines to Sembawang will soon be able to watch food growing\xa0on their doorstep, after the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) launched\xa0tenders for nine urban farming sites on Tuesday (May 12).\nLocated on the rooftops of HDB multi-storey car parks, the sites for rent will be used to farm vegetables and other food crops, as well as for activities like packing and storing produce, said SFA and HDB in a joint news release.\nTwo cluster sites will be tendered out, one at Sembawang and another at Jurong West.\xa0\nConsisting of two plots each, these cluster sites will enable production at scale, allowing farmers to enjoy cost savings, said SFA and HDB.\nA further five sites – in Choa Chu Kang, Tampines, Hougang, Ang Mo Kio and Toa Payoh – will be offered as single sites.\xa0\nThese individual sites will provide opportunities to “testbed innovative ideas”, said SFA and HDB.\nThose interested can submit their proposals via the online Government procurement platform GeBiz before the tender closes at 4pm on Jun 9.\n“Proposals will be assessed on their bid price, production output, design and site layout, as well as (their) business/marketing plan,” said the authorities.\nThe move to find alternative farming space in land-constrained Singapore is part of SFA’s strategy to meet the country’s goal of producing 30 per cent of its nutritional needs locally by 2030, said the two bodies.\xa0\nIt is also in line with HDB’s efforts to intensify greening on estates, they added.\nTuesday’s launch followed last year’s pilot opening of a multi-storey car park rooftop farm in Ang Mo Kio, which sparked growing interest from the industry and the public towards urban farming, said Mr Melvin Chow, senior director of SFA’s food supply resilience division.\n“Residents in the area have been able to enjoy fresh produce from the farm at nearby supermarkets, and can witness first-hand the hard work involved in bringing our food from farm-to-fork,” he said.\n“We hope that consumers will continue to show their appreciation for our local farms by buying their produce.”\nSFA and HDB are looking into opening more urban farms on car park rooftops, with additional public tenders to be launched in the second half of 2020.\nMore details will be released at a later date, said the authorities.\nLast month, a S$30 million grant\xa0was announced for the agri-food industry to speed up the production of commonly consumed food items like eggs, vegetables and fish.\nIt was aimed at further strengthening Singapore's food security, with the\xa0COVID-19 pandemic underscoring the importance of local food production, said authorities.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     food ', '     Singapore Food Agency ', '     agriculture ', '     HDB ']}"

Until then, a Taste Of New York (S$58) is but an order away thanks to Wolfgang's Steakhouse’s\xa0 signature 350g cut of sirloin. Naturally, the popular Porterhouse (S$206) is available too, along with all the trimmings like a Caesar salad (S$25), German potatoes (S$24) and cream of corn (S$17).\nA luscious New York-style cheesecake (S$18) seems like the right thing to order for a sweet end to what promises to be a hearty meal.

      Singapore's top chefs pick their favourite hawker food takeaways and deliveries
  </h1>, 'text': 'It often takes an unfortunate situation like our current fight to contain the spread of COVID-19 to make us more appreciative of the simple pleasures – whether it’s bubble tea or the hawker classics we’ve come to love so much. Thankfully, though, these hawker stalls remain open for business, and operators are whipping up their signatures with gusto, for you to take home or have them delivered.\nIn light of the recent issues raised about the controversially high cost of utilising food delivery platforms for restaurants and hawkers alike, initiatives such as the recently launched\xa0www.sgdabao.com\xa0help consumers search for hawker stalls that make their own delivery arrangements. The site currently lists almost 300 businesses, detailing their speciality and informing how one can order directly from the hawkers.\nIn fact, second-generation hawker Melvin Chew of\xa0Jin Ji Teochew Braised Duck & Kway Chap\xa0not only recognised the urgent need to rally the support of the online community but also decided to act just as quickly. He set up\xa0Hawkers United–Dabao 2020, a community initiative on Facebook, on April 3. Here, hawkers can share with the community – comprising some 260,000 members as of May 11 – their promotions and delivery deals. The service is free of charge and each member can post up to two times a day to target potential lunch and dinner customers.\nThe variety of food to choose from is expectedly diverse. So, to help you get a head start, here’s our list of veritable must-have hawker dishes that you can either have to go or delivered.\n\n\nBEPPE DE VITO: OLD TIONG BAHRU BAK KUT TEH\nThis is a long-time go-to place for\xa0Beppe de Vito, chef-restaurateur of Il Lido Group, whenever he’s in the mood for this comforting heritage dish, which he also likes to have with\xa0Waku Ghin’s Tetsuya Wakuda\xa0when he’s in town. Besides serving up a winning version of bak kut teh that Teochews prefer, braised dishes like the braised pork trotters and steamed fish of the day are just as delightful. Set menus for takeaway or delivery are now available by calling in.\xa0\nOld Tiong Bahru Bak Kut Teh; tel: 6223 3075, 8115 4646\n\n\nHAN LI GUANG: GEYLANG LORONG 29 CHARCOAL FRIED HOKKIEN MEE\nLabyrinth chef-owner Han Li Guang\xa0is true blue champion of local fare, especially when it comes to his favourite hawker fix. Funnily enough, while his choice bak chor mee is from Tai Wah Pork Noodle (not to be confused with the aforementioned Michelin-starred stall proffering the same), he also likes his charcoal-fried Hokkien mee from Geylang Lorong 29.\nBut just so you know, this is located along East Coast Road. The stall at Geylang Lorong 29 is another popular stall called\xa0Swee Guan Hokkien Mee. Good news is that while the former uses the usual delivery platforms for orders within the neighbourhood, it also offers islandwide delivery when you order direct. They also boast decent oyster omelette and fried carrot cake, but it is said that you have to have the satay (chicken, pork, mutton and pork belly) too.\nGeylang Lorong 29 Charcoal Fried Hokkien Mee; tel: 9733 1388\nIVAN BREHM: ROXY LAKSA\nA big fan of Roxy Laksa,\xa0Nouri’s Ivan Brehm\xa0was heartbroken when it moved to Timbre+ and eventually shuttered for good. But this was not before chef Willin Low (Relish and Roketto Izakaya), a regular of this feted laksa stall himself, convinced Roxy’s third-generation hawker master to take him on as an apprentice.\nThe aim was to succeed and preserve this iconic brand of laksa and its traditional recipe. It is now available under Low’s &Will brand of ready-to-eat hawker classics (there’s also mee siam and laksa to choose from). They can be found at selected Cheers convenience stores but most easily from The Soup Spoon’s e-store.\nwww.thesoupspoon.com/estore-order\nMALCOLM LEE: SCISSORS CUT CURRY RICE\nThis is where\xa0Malcolm Lee of Candlenut\xa0heads to for a comforting heap of curry rice topped with deep-fried pork chop, braised pork belly, curry chicken wing, stewed cabbage, braised tofu puff and bean sprout. If you’re in the neighbourhood, you too might want to order some for lunch or dinner. If you’re lucky, there might even be ngor hiang and fish or cuttlefish dishes available. If you want it delivered, you’ll need to order via GrabFood.\nRISHI NALEENDRA: HILL STREET TAI HWA PORK NOODLE\nFor chef\xa0Rishi Naleendra of restaurants Cloudstreet\xa0and\xa0Cheek, getting his fix of this famed bak chor mee used to only involve him getting dressed and taking a short stroll from his previous abode. These days, he has to do what most of us craving something from this Michelin-starred hawker stall have to do – take a drive down and join the famously long queue or get it delivered. Despite its popularity, they do not have their own delivery service. According to their websites and depending on where you live, you could try ordering via GrabFood or Foodpanda.\nHill Street Tai Hwa Pork Noodle; tel: 6292 7477\nSHIGERU KOIZUMI: BLANCO COURT PRAWN MEE\nEsora’s Shigeru Koizumi\xa0loves prawn mee, in particular, its delicately savoury broth. He also prefers to get his fix from this stalwart on Beach Road that has been serving prawn noodles since 1928. The family also runs several prawn noodles stalls – there’s one on Beach Road and along Jalan Kayu.\nRegardless, one can always look forward to those jumbo prawns (they might still offer seasonal wild tiger prawns when in season). The ngor hiang is another must-have. While they are available on the usual food delivery platforms, Blanco Court Prawn Mee also delivers. Check their Facebook account for updates.\nBlanco Court Prawn Mee; tel: 6396 8464\nVIOLET OON: CHINA STREET FRITTERS\nFans know this is one of the few places that still makes their traditional ngor hiang by hand. But what\xa0Violet Oon\xa0loves most from this stall specialising in ngor hiang and other fried snacks is its Hokkien\xa0kuan chiang\xa0(pink Hokkien sausage) that’s made using quality ingredients without any shortcuts.\nBest of all, the owner has found a fair way of getting your order delivered. He works with an independent service provider that charges the customer for the delivery. Charges vary according to distance.

As Singapore hunkered down for the “circuit breaker” period, she found time and reason to grow not just okra, but tapioca, papaya, herbs and other vegetables.\n“We rely on other (countries) for our food, if they don’t sell to us we have nothing to eat,” she said in Mandarin. “This way, at least I can still have lady’s fingers.”\nFarm supply shops and companies that run urban farming workshops told CNA that there has been more interest in home farming since around February or March.\nSingapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange on Feb 7 after some locally transmitted cases of COVID-19 were detected, sparking a brief spate of panic buying.\nIn mid-March, Malaysia imposed a movement control order which raised concerns that food supplies from the country, including vegetables, eggs and fruit, might be affected. Authorities came out swiftly to say that food and essentials from Malaysia will continue to flow during the lockdown.\nBut Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing has warned that Singapore would have to be ready for disruptions to its supply of food and other essentials as lockdowns in various countries have diminished global production capacities and disrupted global supply chains. About 90 per cent of Singapore’s food currently comes from overseas.\nAs the pandemic spread around the world and worsened here, Singapore announced on Apr 3 that most work places and schools would close in a circuit breaker period that started from Apr 7, and that people were to leave their homes only for essential activities such as buying food and groceries.\nGROWTH IN INTEREST, SALES\nFarm 85 Trading, a vegetable farm which also sells seedlings and farm supplies, said that its sales went up by five times right after the circuit breaker was announced, with customers buying a range of items from soil and seedlings to compost.\n“Most of the customers we have seen are people who were new to farming or gardening ... \xa0Almost all customers were determined to try and grow edibles in their own homes,” said Mr Zach Tan, the farm’s manager.\nMr Kevin Tan, director of Ban Lee Huat Seed said they saw a 50 per cent increase in sales of seeds since the start of the outbreak, along with more interest in Asian leafy greens like bak choy and kang kong.\xa0\nUrban farming social enterprise Edible Garden City has seen an uptick of interest in home gardening, a spokesperson said. Enquiries for their edible landscaping service increased by 40 per cent, but they could not follow up with these requests after circuit breaker measures kicked in.\n“Many of those who enquired about garden builds cited COVID-19 as just one amongst a host of reasons why they wanted to have a home garden … Many also added that they now see that food security is an important issue in Singapore,” said the spokesperson.\nTwo centres that run organic farming courses, Gardens with Purpose and The Living Centre, also said that demand for their courses are at a high.\nMs Joanne Ng, founder of Gardens with Purpose, said that she was slated to have a large class just before the circuit breaker but she had to suspend it as measures restricting gatherings were tightened.\xa0\nShe is now considering selling the vegetables she grows on her 2,000 sq ft farm as she has been getting more queries from consumers.\nThe National Parks Board’s (NParks) said that as the interest in gardening increases, more people are growing their own microgreens, herbs and other edibles at home.\n“Given the amount of time we are spending at home, it is a good opportunity for more people to learn to garden at home,” said Mr Ng Cheow Kheng, group director for Horticulture & Community Gardening at the agency.\nGREENHORNS & BEAN SPROUTS\nRock climbing instructor and gardening enthusiast Jack Yam told CNA that substantially more people have been asking to join the Facebook interest group he runs – Urban Farmers (Singapore).\nSome have also been posting questions on how to start their own home gardens or farms, which prompted him to post tutorials on the Facebook page for their reference.\n“There were quite a number of posts in the group, new members actually saying that hey, I'm totally new. I have no idea of how to start. What are the things that are needed?” he said.\nOne of them was engineer Ong Chee Lam, who said that he has an interest in growing edibles but has yet to start a proper farm at home. He has begun experimenting with bean sprouts and some herbs.\n“The reason why I wanted to start was because of how the COVID-19 situation unfolds, it made us realise that the food security is a real issue so went to read up and see how we can do something in urban Singapore,” he said.\nHis first haul was 400g of bean sprouts which added some crunch to his mee rebus, and he will continue, he said.\n“I suspect the new normal will not be the same ... (I) will definitely continue to research and take action to keep this as a sustainable hobby,” he added.\nFLOURISHING FARMS\nMeanwhile, some experienced growers CNA spoke to are growing more edibles rather than ornamental plants.\nMs Mandisa Jacquelin Toh said that her family was working towards self-sufficiency when it comes to vegetables and fruit.\n“It's truly a right direction when we are hit by COVID-19 and the circuit breaker period … we don't have to risk ourselves going to wet market and supermarket unnecessarily,” she said.\nThe IT professional, who is in her 40s, said she has set up a rotating system which allows her to harvest some produce every day from her rooftop garden, which she said is a third the size of a football field.\nThe list of edible plants she grows rivals a supermarket’s selection, including long beans, figs, mulberries, herbs, corn, tomatoes, chilli, lime, okra and bittergourd. She even has muskmelons, watermelons, guava, custard apples, starfruit, kedongdong, mangoes and cempedek.\n“We regretted not starting even earlier when COVID-19 started,” said the long-time gardener, who started seriously growing edibles about 10 months ago.\nMr Yam, who grows his plants along the corridor and common spaces outside his Housing Board flat, also made the switch months earlier and said he was glad he did. Now, vegetables including xiao bai cai, kalian and kale make up 80 per cent of his urban garden.\n“Because of my space constraints, it’s not fully sustainable, but at least it supplements the food that we are eating,” he said. “Seeing the sudden surge in interest, I'm actually quite excited and happy about it.”\nBut he found that many people who wanted to start their home gardens or farms were “caught off-guard” and once the circuit breaker started, it was hard for them to get supplies. This was why he also put up a tutorial on growing bean sprouts, and he has seen quite a few people posting their attempts online.\n“Green beans are easy to get hold off, and then within three to four days you can get the harvest. As a parent, you could occupy your kids with this particular activity, yet at the same time grow something that your family can eat,” he said.\nNParks has also put up a series of tutorials on home gardening on social media, including DIY gardening videos, information on plants that can be easily grown at home and simple recipes for produce from home gardens.\nSome simple plants to start with are microgreens, Brazilian spinach, Indian borage and herbs like mints and basils, Mr Ng suggested.\nGREEN THERAPY\nBeyond sustenance, the home farmers said that caring for their plants has been good exercise and a source of joy in an anxious time for many.\nHalfway house The Helping Hand happened to start their urban farm this month, and tending to the vegetables has replaced some of the carpentry and furniture delivery activities residents did before the circuit breaker period.\nAn underused grass patch at the home now has 20 raised vegetable beds that is providing both food and therapy of sorts.\n“It teaches our residents some very important skills and values, which helps us in some ways as emotional regulator. It teaches them patience, and also introduces the green concept,” CEO Mervyn Lim told CNA.\nFor now, the vegetables will be\xa0cooked and consumed by the residents but they will look into turning the farm into a social enterprise, and may even open a café, he added.\xa0\nResident Toh Chiang Hee, who is in his early 60s, told CNA that seeing the plants grow has given him a lot of joy.\n“I talk to the seedlings and tell them to grow bigger and taller,” he said in Mandarin.\nFOOD SECURITY\nThese shoots of growing interest come as Singapore aims to produce 30 per cent of its food supply locally by 2030.\xa0A new S$30 million grant was announced in April for the agri-food industry to help commercial farms speed up the production of commonly consumed food like eggs, vegetables and fish.\nAnd the spurt of enthusiasm for home farming springs from a gradual burgeoning of interest in recent years, said both Ms Ng of Gardens with Purpose and Ms Faith Foo from The Living Centre.\n“We have been advocating for urban farming through a wide range of urban farming courses since the establishment of our centre the last five years, and thus have also seen a progressive trend of people interested in urban farming,” said Ms Foo, who has moved all their courses online for the circuit breaker period.\nMs Ng said that she has noticed more young people and families sign up for her organic farming courses before the COVID-19 outbreak and hopes that\xa0schools can be next. Before this, many Singaporeans still felt that it was easier to import vegetables from other countries, and the toil for “a few vegetables” was not worth it, she added.\xa0\n“Toxic chemicals are everywhere, be it food or the environment, so I started to prepare this 10 years ago … now the time is right, Singaporeans didn’t expect the food supply chain can be disrupted,” she said. “I didn’t see COVID-19 coming but I knew there would be a demand for clean food.”\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\n"", 'related_topics': ['     food ', '     agriculture ', '     COVID-19 ']}"

      Weekend veg out: Vegetarian food that’s available for delivery in Singapore
  </h1>, 'text': 'Six weeks into the circuit breaker and perhaps a few kilograms heavier from binge-eating, you might be wondering how to survive three more weeks of impulsive eating. A healthier diet is a good place to start. If you’ve been meaning to give a\xa0vegetarian\xa0diet a go, now’s the perfect time to do it.\nOf course, you have the option of\xa0preparing your own meal at home. But if you want to enjoy having chefs whip up a delectable meal, here are several notable restaurants from which you can order in your healthful fixes.\nARTEMIS GRILL\nGreens are your best friend, which is why executive chef Oliver Hyde’s delivery menu consists of mostly delicious grains and salads. Fans of kale can have this studded with apple slices, caramelised hazelnuts, crumbled feta cheese and dill. Best enjoyed with the people you’re quarantining with, why not include the tabbouleh salad of bulgur wheat, mixed herbs and lemon juice, as well as the spicy roasted vegetables.\xa0\nClick here\xa0to order\nBLUE JASMINE \nTake a break from the restaurant’s usual hits of chicken curry and tom yum seafood, and give its vegetarian offerings a go. Opt for the a la carte menu if you prefer to build your own feast; make sure you include the crunchy fried seasonal vegetables with tofu, and a vegetarian version of the pad thai. Instead of seafood or meat, the chef uses chai poh (preserved radish) tossed with assorted vegetables and tamarind sauce.\nAlso, save the hassle of planning your lunch menu and have one of the bento sets. The Heura red curry set is a good start, featuring plant-based chicken bathed in a rich and flavourful base, piqued with sweet and sour notes from the use of pineapples, grapes and lychees. Or, choose the Omn! basil kaprao set, comprising housemade basil paste cooked with OmniMeat, snake beans, sliced chilli and sweet basil leaves. Both sets come with jasmine rice and, for dessert, mango sticky rice.\nBlue Jasmine, 6824 8851; hello [at] bluejasmine.com.sg ()\nBUONA TERRA\nWhat’s a stay-at-home feast without desserts, right? Chef Denis Lucchi’s olive oil cake with strawberries is a traditional recipe from his hometown. It\'s also as decadent as it is guilt-free. Squares of olive oil sponge cake are combined with sweet white and red strawberries from Japan, yoghurt panna cotta, olive oil powder, and strawberry-and-lemon gel. It’s garnished with micro mint leaves for a refreshing touch.\xa0\nClick here\xa0to order\nCULINA BISTRO\nA lighter lunch calls for the restaurant’s kabocha pumpkin salad. Other than the generous chunks of pumpkin, this one-bowl-meal is brimming with crisp leafy greens, quinoa, spinach, cashew nuts and yoghurt.\xa0\nClick here\xa0to order\nLEVEL33\nIt’s hard to resist the temptation of executive chef ArChan Chan’s burgers. But if you’re taking a break from meats, it’s a good idea to opt the no-less-delicious Brewery Veggie Burger. The secret to its deliciousness lies in its juicy patty – a hearty ensemble of aromatics, grains, button mushrooms, sweet potato and spent grain. What\'s more, it’s stacked with gooey cheddar cheese, zingy gherkins, caramelised onions and chipotle mayo.\xa0\nClick here\xa0to order\nLUMO\nIt’s a pity that many gourmands weren’t able to dine at this restaurant and\xa0bar, as it opened just before the circuit breaker measures were implemented. That said, the team is now offering its signature dishes for delivery, including their enhanced version of the roasted cauliflower steak. The cruciferous vegetable is cooked to a crunchy texture, and its flavour enhanced with a light coating of Japanese togarashi aioli and a squeeze of lemon juice.\xa0\nClick here\xa0to order\nPRELUDIO\nChef Fernando Arevalo’s concise menu of cakes, pastries and bread bundles also includes the classic dish, La Cortina, that was first featured in the restaurant\'s previous Monochrome chapter. The meat-free agnolotti is loaded with sweet and silky butternut squash, and served with a rich parmesan sauce. It’s topped with almond snow and aged balsamic vinegar. Each order comes with detailed instructions on assembling the dish, just like how Arevalo plates it at the restaurant.\xa0\nClick here\xa0to order\nSPRMRKT\nWhen you’re just too busy with work, what you need is a quick and easy lunch fix prepared by a chef. So, why not have head chef Marc Wee’s healthy and palatable grain bowls\xa0delivered to your home? The black barley grain bowl is ideal if you need to load up on proteins and nutrients, as it’s jam-packed with farro beans, black barley, roasted cauliflower, blistered tomato. It\'s also dressed in a sweet wild honey dressing.\xa0\nClick here\xa0to order\xa0\nSUMMERLONG\nBeing cooped up in your home, you might be craving the fresh and bright flavours of Greek and\xa0Mediterranean cuisines. Thankfully, the chefs here have curated a Pelican on the Move menu, which brings the popular hits of the region to your dining table.\nThe summer bowl is a popular choice, as it can easily be customised to cater to your vegetarian preferences. Choose the summer salad or the Greek salad as your base, then toss in either the saffron rice or quinoa, and wild mushrooms to make it more filling. It’s not a Greek meal without pita, and here, the flat bread comes with flavourful dips like cauliflower hummus and tzatziki.\xa0\nClick here\xa0to order\nTABLESCAPE RESTAURANT & BAR\nFact is, it\'s always a good idea to include more greens in your diet, but especially so during the circuit breaker period. That’s why the culinary team here has partnered with\xa0Green Monday\xa0to create the Green Menu, for takeaway. For Italian offerings sans meat, the pizza margherita with a thin and crisp crust is laden with tomato sauce, Daiya (plant-based) cheese and fresh basil leaves, while the spaghetti ""bolognese"" is instead tossed with tomato sauce and vegetable ragu.\nOther Western favourites given a healthy twist include an alternative to the classic sausage sandwich. This version uses flavoursome\xa0Beyond Sausage\xa0that\'s paired with spicy sauteed kale, Daiya cheese, tomatoes and bird’s eye chilli.\xa0\nClick here\xa0to order\n', 'related_topics': ['     food ', '     Singapore ', '     delivery ']}"

      From Michelin-starred cuisine to Korean comfort food and home-style classics
  </h1>, 'text': 'In food-obsessed Singapore, restaurants are our community hubs, places we head to for a bowlful of pleasure, a glass of wine and the good company of friends. But what happens when a pandemic forces diners into their homes and food out of the restaurants? You try to stay afloat by providing comfort, offered Sun Kim.\nThe South Korean is the chef and co-owner of one-Michelin-starred restaurant Meta, which typically serves a distinctly unique cuisine that draws from his training in modern European techniques and his Korean heritage. Forced by circuit breaker measures to offer only takeaway meals, Kim returned to his roots to extend the warmth of a home-cooked meal to his patrons.\n“The food we cook now is heartier and served in bigger portions, not like our regular fine dining menu. It’s what people are craving at this time,” he said over the phone on a sweltering weekday afternoon.\nThe food is inspired by his years growing up in South Korea and a few weeks ago, included a chicken stew rich with garlic, gochujang and vegetables that his mother used to serve at her restaurant when he was a teenager. “You could say that it’s like the equivalent of chicken curry (in Singapore),” he explained. “It’s simple, flavourful and comforting.”\nAlso on the menu was kimbap, Korea’s counterpart to sushi, which is typically served on birthdays and at picnics. “We only got to eat it three to four times a year. So whenever my mum made it, I would stand beside her and eat the last bits that she trimmed off,” he recalled fondly.\nNot all his classic Korean recipes come from his mother. Google has proven a useful resource for him to glean from. “The truth is I don’t know very much about Korean food,” he said, laughing. “I mean, when it’s the food you grew up with, a lot of times, you don’t have a recipe. You just recreate it from memory, so I’ve had to look some things up on the internet.”\nCatering to Singaporean tastes is also an important consideration since not everyone appreciates delicacies like blood sausage soup, which Kim counts among his favourite things to eat. So, he looks to the restaurant menus of his home country to see what they are serving to nourish spirits in these times.\nHe also polls opinions among his team, made up of Singaporeans and Malaysians, about the Korean food that they would like to eat. “That’s how we ended up doing jajangmyeon (Korean-style black bean noodles) for one of our menus,” he revealed.\nIt’s no surprise that Kim has expanded the concept of family food to include his team. They recently started a Staff Takeover Menu on Saturdays, a set comprising comfort Singaporean and Malaysian dishes.\n“It’s the food we eat for our staff meal and we want our customers to be able to have a taste of it,” he said. So far, the menu has included Hainanese chicken rice, fish soup, and spring vegetables with oyster dressing.\nMeta’s takeaway menus cost below S$50 and comprise about four to five dishes designed for one person. Smaller appetites can easily stretch the food over two meals.\n“This is a tough time for all of us,” Kim concluded. “So we just want to deliver hearty fare from our Meta family to everyone out there, so we can share the good food together.”\nSpeaking of deliveries, don’t be surprised if you find this strapping South Korean chef bearing your order at your doorstep. It’s just another out-of-ordinary thing that chefs are doing to keep their businesses going in this climate.\nVisit metarestaurant.sg for more information\n', 'related_topics': ['     food ', '     gastronomy ', '     Singapore ', '     Restaurants ']}"

      'It’s about trying until our last breath': New F&amp;B players cook up survival plans for COVID-19 crisis 
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: For more than half a year, first-time food and beverage entrepreneur Andrea Tan had been working hard to get her cafe, Lucid, ready for business.\nBut on Feb 4, a day after concluding the cafe’s soft launch, a Chinese health products shop located on the adjacent street was discovered as Singapore’s first local cluster of COVID-19.\nFour people had caught the novel coronavirus after some had “prolonged interactions” with a Chinese tour group that visited the shop in mid-January. The number of infections linked to Yong Thai Hang, the health products shop on Cavan Road, would later grow to nine in less than a week.\xa0\nFor Ms Tan and her co-owners who decided to bite the bullet and open the cafe\xa0as planned, this was “very scary” news.\n“We were very worried that people would start avoiding the area, thinking that it wasn’t safe,” she said.\nBy Mar 10, the cluster at Yong Thai Hang was given the all-clear but the virus outbreak in Singapore did not stop. Each spike in the number of infections and countermeasures by authorities – safe distancing rules followed by a “circuit breaker” that included a ban on dining-in – dealt a blow to the newly opened cafe\xa0and its owners.\nThe “worst week” came when the circuit breaker kicked in on Apr 7. Revenue fell by a sharp 90 per cent.\n“The first week of the circuit breaker was really bleak for us. We haven’t started deliveries yet so we were reliant on takeaways but no one was coming out to take away food,” said Ms Tan.\nPlans that were drawn up previously, like holding coffee brewing classes, had to be shelved as new ones, such as offering deliveries, were quickly added to shore up business.\nMs Tan and one of her co-owners are now doing their own deliveries, and can make up to 15 trips a day.\nSpeaking to CNA at on one weekday at 8pm before her final delivery for the day, the 25-year-old, who also runs a coffee consultancy and is an award-winning barista, said: “I’ve been joking with my friends that my quarter-life crisis is a virus pandemic.”\nNEWCOMERS FACE ROUGHER RIDE\nMs Tan’s experience is not uncommon with the F&B industry among those hardest-hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, although newcomers are likely facing a rougher ride.\n“We’ve not had enough history in the F&B scene to have our own supporters so it’s a fight against time to have our brand known and remembered,” she said, while noting that Lucid, with an investment of about S$200,000, could now take longer to break even.\n“This is definitely not the best time to be launching something new and hope that people will want to give you a try.”\nOver at a coffee shop in Toa Payoh, an eight-month-old noodle stall is trying to stay afloat after the COVID-19 outbreak struck just as business was stabilising.\n“It’s definitely been at least a 50 per cent drop in sales,” said co-owner Jeevan Ananthan who is also the main cook serving up bowls of fishball noodles and bak chor mee.\nThe 29-year-old ditched his investment banking job last year to join the hawker trade with former digital marketer May Leena Krishnan. But a “racial barrier” made it difficult for the couple at the start.\nSaid Ms Krishnan: “There was a period when every stall will be crowded except ours. People are just not used to seeing an Indian man cooking Chinese noodles.”\nSome had “snarky comments”, recalled the 30-year-old. “There were people who asked the other stall owners if we are really selling bak chor mee or questioned us if we know what the ingredients are and what we are doing.”\nTwo months after starting up, Ms Krishnan decided to put her marketing skills to use and uploaded a video of Mr Ananthan cooking fishball noodles on Facebook. That made the rounds on the social media platform, attracting media interviews and before long, the stall was seeing customers who came from as far as Changi.\n“People thought we were interesting and after giving us a try, they realised that our food is actually not bad,” said Ms Krishnan, who makes the stall’s fish balls and fish dumplings from scratch.\nThe couple managed to break even by January as orders picked up steadily. However, business soon started to see a slowdown with the virus outbreak emerging later that month.\nAmid the looming uncertainty, the couple is putting on hold plans for expansion.\n“The only plan now is to stay put and protect what we have so carefully built,” said Mr Ananthan.\nMr Lim Wee Hsien, who co-owns Wursthans Switzerland at the new Paya Lebar Quarter shopping mall, is in a similar situation.\nHis 40-seater casual diner also endured a slow start after opening last October. It took three months and various adjustments to the menu before the restaurant found a following.\n“We were doing very well in January and into February, so much so that we were looking for a second location,” he said. “Then COVID-19 got worse and everything has changed.”\nThe unexpected pandemic now threatens to take the business back to square one after revenue dropped by 90 per cent since the circuit breaker rules were enforced.\nGovernment policies such as the Jobs Support Scheme to subsidise local employees’ salaries\xa0have helped to alleviate cash flow concerns, said Mr Lim. He was also relieved when his landlord, Lendlease, offered to waive rental payments for April and pass on the Government-granted property tax rebates for the month of May.\nBut with the circuit breaker extended until Jun 1, the outlook remains bleak, especially for a new entrant like him, noted Mr Lim who said he has discussed the possibility of a 20 to 30 per cent pay cut with his five full-timers until the end of these measures.\xa0He has stopped employing part-timers to reduce costs.\nAmid expectations of a slow recovery in footfall and consumer spending, he hopes that landlords could consider having retail rent based on gross turnover for at least six months.\n“In F&B, it usually takes about six months to know if your concept works and we know ours is working. We just need to tide through this period,” said Mr Lim.\nTURNING TO DELIVERIES, NEW OFFERINGS\nDespite the mounting challenges, all four entrepreneurs plan to keep operating during the circuit breaker period so as to keep their relatively new brands going and earn whatever they can.\nTo cope, they have adjusted operating hours, such as closing earlier as people stay home, and pivoted to takeaways and deliveries.\nApart from having their noodles available on food delivery app Deliveroo, Ms Krishnan and Mr Ananthan have engaged a driver to deliver islandwide and introduced a pre-order service for takeaways.\n“We are trying to see this unexpected turn of events as a lesson for us so we want to learn and adapt. Since the launch (three\xa0weeks ago), we have seen somewhat of a pick up,” he said.\nWursthans Switzerland is also on board two of the major food delivery platforms here, with “deliveries now the only lifeline”, although Mr Lim said the restaurant hopes to get its own ordering platform up and running soon.\nThis is because with more F&B establishments joining the delivery platforms, new players like him are finding it increasingly tough to fight for visibility, he said. Having its own site will also help to save on the “steep” commission fees charged by delivery platforms.\nMeanwhile, these new players are adding new\xa0menu items to cater to the stay-home crowd.\nMs Krishnan and Mr Ananthan have begun accepting orders for their handmade fish dumplings, as more people stay home and cook.\nOver at Lucid, Ms Tan is getting ready to launch an online store selling coffee beans, drip bags, filters and other equipment for those who wish to brew their coffee at home.\n“We are constantly thinking about what to do to go on,” she said.\xa0“For me and our business, it’s about trying until our last breath basically.”\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\n', 'related_topics': ['     COVID-19 ', '     food ', '     Restaurants ']}"

      How this chef turned obstacles into opportunity, one spicy dish at a time
  </h1>, 'text': 'Last February, Singapore’s foodie community was abuzz with news of the imminent opening of the city’s first Sri Lankan restaurant. That it would be established by Rishi Naleendra, chef and owner of feted eateries Cheek and Cloudstreet, made it even more compelling. Since he started Cheek By Jowl (now rebranded as Cheek) in 2016, Naleendra has earned a devoted following for his pleasingly unique cuisine that brings together Australian produce, modern European techniques and Sri Lankan touches.\xa0 \xa0\nWe all know how this story goes. COVID-19 arrived, stayed, and has changed our lives in unthinkable ways. Restaurants can barely operate under today’s circuit breaker rules, let alone flourish.\n\n\nBut Kotuwa, it turns out, was always going to be a hit.\nDespite its delayed opening (it was set to begin operations in early April at the revamped Wanderlust Hotel), Kotuwa’s food has already earned much praise. In a quick turn to adapt to the situation, Naleendra conveyed Kotuwa’s concept to Cloudstreet’s kitchen and began selling its menu for takeaway.\n\n\n“We could not have done a lot to make Cloudstreet work in a home setting,” Naleendra said of his fine dining restaurant. “And even if we did, it wouldn’t appeal to as wide an audience as Kotuwa does. Also, this gives us an opportunity to try out some of the things we would like to do with Kotuwa when it officially opens.”\xa0\nNaleendra hopes to open Kotuwa once the circuit breaker measures are lifted, and when Singapore is ready to welcome foreign arrivals\xa0again – two Sri Lankan chefs will join him here once that happens.\xa0\nNevertheless, ever hungry for new culinary experiences – perhaps even more so now with the stay-home mandate – Singapore’s foodies have responded eagerly to Kotuwa’s showcase of distinctively Sri Lankan dishes. Some, like the Kottu (from S$18), are familiar – chopped roti prata fried with chicken or jackfruit to yield a satisfying one-dish meal that wouldn’t be out of place in a sarabat stall.\nOthers are more unique, like the Dallo Baduma (S$22), battered and fried calamari tossed in an addictive chilli butter that packs a real punch. Its heat can be tempered with a mouthful of Kaju Curry (S$16), a creamy concoction of cashews and green peas cooked in an aromatic coconut curry; or a Dhal Curry (S$8), another lush stew of red lentils flavoured with black mustard seeds that imbue it with resonant savouriness.\nThere is a fantastic black pork curry (S$22), not unlike vinegar-laced Goan vindaloo, braised with toasted coconut, pepper and chillies, which pairs wonderfully with the Seeni Sambol (S$8), a more-ish caramelised onion relish.\nVibrant, rib-sticking fare like this is exactly the sort of thing for enjoying in the comforts of home, grubby fingers and all. Which goes to prove that you can indeed turn an obstacle into opportunity while waiting for the tides to turn.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Singapore ', '     Restaurants ', '     food ', '     gastronomy ', '     Profiles ', '     Chefs ']}"

      COVID-19: McDonald’s Singapore extends closure of restaurants indefinitely
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Fast food chain McDonald’s Singapore has extended its closure after it was initially set to reopen on May 5, the restaurant said in a Facebook post on Thursday (Apr 30).\nMcDonald’s did not specify when its stores\xa0would reopen, but said they\xa0would be closed for “just a little longer” in light of the ongoing COVID-19 situation.\nIt explained that under the essential services framework, it would be allowed to restart operations from May 4, but decided not to. It first suspended restaurant operations on Apr 19.\n“We’ve decided to extend our closure for just a little longer for the safety and well-being of our employees and customers.\n“We will continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation in the community before determining an appropriate time for us to reopen.”\nThe fast food chain also reassured its frontline employees their jobs were secure, and that they will be paid their salaries during the temporary closure.\n""Our frontline employees are important to us and we wish for all of them to stay home a little longer.""\nIt added there were no new COVID-19 cases among McDonald’s employees either.\nEarlier in April, it was announced that several McDonald’s employees had been diagnosed with the coronavirus. In the restaurant’s update on Thursday, it said all seven employees who were affected “are on the road to recovery”.\nIt added: “Many of you have sent your well-wishes – on behalf of our employees, we thank you so much.\n“From our McDonald’s family to yours, we’re truly grateful for your patience and understanding.”\n\n\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\n', 'related_topics': ['     COVID-19 ', '     food ']}"

      F&amp;B businesses come to grips with new circuit breaker measures, but some unsure what to do
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Food and beverage outlets are quickly adjusting their operations as more stringent\xa0""circuit breaker"" measures kicked in\xa0on Wednesday (Apr 22), but some businesses CNA spoke to still had\xa0questions on what they were allowed to do.\nAccording to tightened rules announced on Tuesday evening, standalone outlets that sell only beverages, packaged snacks, confectionery or desserts have to close. Manufacturing plants that make items such as cakes, ice cream and chocolate are also banned from operating.\nSome businesses, which requested not to be named, said earlier on Wednesday\xa0they were still clarifying with the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on whether they can operate and what they are allowed to sell.\n\n\nOne such company sells snacks and beverages as well as hot food, while one bakery said that it was\xa0not sure if it should fulfil online orders for cakes from before the stricter measures were announced.\xa0Another bakery selling\xa0mainly pastries, such as croissants, said it would\xa0wait for instructions from MTI before deciding its next step.\nMTI had\xa0clarified that bakeries that sell mainly bread are exempted from the suspension, but if they normally sell other items such as cakes, then only existing cakes can be sold and new ones cannot be baked for sale.\nBakeries that sell mainly bread, such as Four Leaves bakery, remain open but those\xa0that sell mostly cakes, such as Bengawan Solo, are shutting for the time being.\n\n\nFor bakery chain Bengawan Solo, the cakes and kaya that it\xa0has\xa0in stock are\xa0going to food charity Willing Hearts and to migrant workers through Project Chulia Street.\xa0\nIt will also continue to pay the salaries of its\xa0roughly 400 workers from the over 40 retail stores and the central kitchens, said Mr Henry Liew, director at Bengawan Solo.\nBakery PrimaDeli said in a Facebook post that it will be “suspending all cake production with immediate effect” but told customers to ""keep a lookout for updates on our outlet operating hours on both our website and social media platforms"". Two franchisees of the PrimaDeli chain told CNA they will shut their stores as most of the products will not be available.\nOld Chang Kee, known for its\xa0curry puffs, said most of its stores or 60 outlets remain open for takeaway and delivery as the business falls under the ""hot/cooked snacks or bread” category. The closed outlets are located in the city or tourist belts, and have been shut since the start of the circuit breaker on Apr 7.\nBreadTalk bakeries and\xa0Toast Box cafes remain open but will sell only\xa0bread, toast and packaged drinks.\nAs for shops selling multiple food items, the ministry takes into consideration what they predominantly sell.\xa0\n“For example, if you predominantly sell hot meals and some selection of desserts, you can continue sales of all the food items that are not within the manufacturing suspended scope,” the ministry said.\nCNA saw\xa0a shuttered Jollibean outlet on Wednesday,\xa0but Mr Bean, known for its soya milk, said most of its\xa0shops will stay open.\xa0\nMr Thomas Koh, COO of\xa0Mr Bean, said the 55 outlets that are open\xa0for takeaways also offer hot food such as rice bowls and porridge, while outlets that sell only desserts will close for now. The brand has\xa0also\xa0launched a website to take orders for deliveries.\nOne exception in the new rules is\xa0that dessert and beverage outlets in\xa0hawker centres, coffeeshops and food courts are still allowed to operate. This applies to businesses like\xa0Lao Ban Soya Beancurd, which said on Facebook that some outlets\xa0will stay\xa0open, such as the one at Old Airport Road hawker centre.\n\n\nMeanwhile, shops that sell only coffee and tea will also be shut, but cafes like Starbucks will remain open for takeaway and delivery as the coffee chain\xa0also offers food.\xa0Starbucks told CNA that, for now, some\xa0outlets are closed, including one at\xa0Parkland Green in East Coast Park, as all F&B businesses\xa0in parks\xa0must suspend\xa0operations.\nOther shops affected are those that sell mainly snacks such as nuts, potato chips, popcorn and bak kwa. While their physical stores will close, retailers like Bee Cheng Hiang and Irvins Salted Egg are encouraging customers to order the snacks online.\nSAFE DISTANCING MEASURES\nThe eateries that remain open also told CNA that they have put in place safe distancing measures and precautions at their stores.\nThese include taking the temperature of their workers twice daily, requiring them to wear masks and to keep their distance from other workers, delivery riders and customers. Most said they have increased the frequency of cleaning at their stores.\xa0\nOld Chang Kee said that it has\xa0reduced staff strength by 20 per cent across all its outlets and in its central kitchen “to cope with the new guidelines”.\nFast food chain KFC said it has implemented a “contactless takeaway” system at its 78 outlets and customers are alerted when their order is ready, so there is no need for them to wait at the restaurant.\n“For the safety of our older staff who are considered the ‘at-risk’ group, we have reassigned them from the front line counter to do lighter work in the kitchen to minimise their contact with customers,” a spokewoman said.\nA&W, which has two outlets in Singapore, said it\xa0requires its\xa0employees to wash their hands hourly with anti-microbial handwash. It also encourages cashless payment to minimise contact between customers and servers.\xa0Starbucks said it is encouraging customers to order in advance before heading to the store.\nThe tightened measures came as Singapore extended its circuit breaker period for four weeks until Jun 1. On Sunday, fast food chain McDonald’s announced it would suspend\xa0operations until May 4 after seven employees contracted COVID-19.\nOn Wednesday, the number of COVID-19 cases in Singapore crossed the 10,000\xa0mark with\xa01,016 new cases reported.\nCNA has contacted MTI for comments.\n\n\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\n', 'related_topics': ['     circuit breaker ', '     COVID-19 ', '     food ']}"

      Demand for frozen food, freezers spikes amid COVID-19 pandemic
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: With\xa0Singaporeans staying at home as much as possible amid the COVID-19 pandemic, supermarkets here are seeing a spike in demand for frozen food.\xa0\nSince the onset of COVID-19, NTUC FairPrice has seen increased demand for frozen foods such as poultry, processed food and vegetables, said a spokesperson.\xa0\n“Demand for these items has\xa0increased by more than 20 per cent compared to the last two months,” said the spokesperson.\xa0\nA Dairy Farm Group spokesperson told CNA that Cold Storage and Giant supermarkets have seen “significant growth in sales” for frozen foods between February and March 2020, compared to the same period last year.\xa0\n“Of all the items in the category, frozen vegetables such as mixed vegetables, leafy vegetables, carrots, corn and potatoes has seen the most demand, increasing by a volume of about 50 per cent,” said the spokesperson.\xa0\n“In order to keep up with the demand, we have been working hard with our suppliers, securing new sources to ensure our customers continue to get what they need.”\nFairPrice also said it will continue to diversify its sources and work with supplies from different countries “to ensure the community has a stable supply of daily essentials at affordable prices”.\xa0\n“In addition, we will continue to stockpile to ensure undisrupted supplies in the event of crises like this, which helps to provide buffer for alternative supply sources if needed,” said the spokesperson.\xa0\n“To discourage stockpiling and hoarding, we have limited purchase for some in-demand items, to ensure that essentials will remain available to all customers.”\nFollowing Malaysia’s announcement on travel restrictions in and out of the country, FairPrice implemented new purchase limits on Mar\xa017.\nWith the spike in demand for frozen food, Singaporeans are also buying freezers to store their purchases.\xa0\nFreezers were one of the top-selling items for COURTS the weekend after the circuit breaker measures were announced on Apr 3, said a COURTS spokesperson.\xa0\n“Currently, inventory levels are running low and our team is working with suppliers to make more available via our online store.”\nFROZEN FOOD VERSUS\xa0FRESH PRODUCE\nDieticians that CNA spoke to said that frozen food can be a good, healthy alternative to fresh produce.\xa0\n“If handled well, frozen foods can be a convenient and affordable way to incorporate healthy food from every food group, including whole grains, fruits, vegetables, protein and dairy,""\xa0said Ms Claudine Loong, a lecturer with Nanyang Polytechnic’s School of Chemical and Life Sciences.\xa0\nMs Loong added that most frozen fruits and vegetables are freshly picked and often frozen within hours.\xa0\n“This allows them to retain their nutrients and flavours. There is minimal change to their nutrient content such as carbohydrates, protein, fat, vitamins and minerals.\xa0\n“Sometimes, frozen fruits and vegetables may even contain more vitamins and minerals than fresh food because of this.”\nMs Carolyn Stephen, a nutritionist with Singapore Polytechnic’s Food and Innovation Resource Centre stressed that if shoppers are buying more frozen food, they should follow the same principles as when purchasing fresh items to ensure a balanced diet.\xa0\n“Eating the same frozen foods repeatedly is also not good because you\'re going to\xa0be missing out on a variety of vitamins and minerals that different foods gives you. So even if you’re choosing frozen fruits, it’s better to have a variety.\xa0\n“And of course, in moderation. We don\'t want to excessively eat too much of the same kind of food, we don\'t want to have that nutrient imbalance.”\nMs Stephen noted that a balanced meal is most important, and planning what to prepare in advance would help make sure that all the food items, frozen or otherwise, are used before the expiry date.\xa0\n“If you bought a lot of frozen food and you don\'t know quite how to use it, make sure that you know when you\'re going to use it up. It\'s important for adults to actually plan the meals out and then take stock of what they have actually bought so that they know that they\'re actually cooking it every day,” she added.\xa0\nBoth Ms Stephen and Ms Loong stressed that thawed food should not be refrozen. Dormant bacteria can become more active when the food is thawed, said Ms Stephen, explaining why the food should not be refrozen.\xa0\n“The safest way to defrost frozen food is in the refrigerator. While doing so, ensure that juices from the meat do not drip onto other foods,” said Ms Loong.\xa0\n“After defrosting the food, it is also important to cook it immediately and avoid refreezing it again.”\nFrozen convenience foods, just like their fresh counterparts, should be eaten in moderation, said Ms Loong.\n“Unfortunately, not all frozen foods are made equally. Frozen food like ready-to-eat meals, pizzas and chicken nuggets may contain high amounts of calories, saturated fats, sodium and added sugar, and should not be eaten excessively,”\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\n', 'related_topics': ['     COVID-19 ', '     food ']}"

      How Kuala Lumpur's F&amp;B industry is responding to the COVID-19 crisis
  </h1>, 'text': ""When the Malaysian Movement Control Ordinance (MCO) came into effect on March 18, 2020 to curb the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, the everyday lives of Malaysians became very different overnight.\nThe restrictions, which included going out to buying necessities, have been further tightened with the extension of the MCO from two to four weeks, effectively locking the country down until April 14, 2020.\nThe MCO is particularly strictly enforced in the Klang Valley, Malaysia’s urban centre which is the hardest hit by the outbreak. Kuala Lumpur (KL) is also home to the country’s largest concentration of restaurants which, under the MCO, are allowed to stay open, but only for takeaways.\nThis option may seem incongruous for fine dining restaurants which are more accustomed to serving up crafted courses on fine china rather than pastas in styrofoam boxes, but the reality is that restaurants are cash-reliant businesses; no kitchen activity means no revenue.\nCNA Luxury spoke to five of KL’s leading fine dining destinations to find out how they’re making the MCO work for them.\n\n\nBABE\nFor Michelin-starred chef Jeff Ramsey, who co-owns modern Japanese restaurant Babe, the MCO has been an exercise in seeing how quickly he and his team could pivot. Within a week of the MCO, Babe announced an entirely new menu that would work with the added delivery time.\nRamsey chose a Tokyo street food theme as it was related to the Babe brand.\xa0“We want to offer people some joy in these trying times, so we write messages to guests and put them in the delivery bag. We still have premium items on our menu in the hope that it appeals to those who want something of higher quality than what is available in the delivery market currently,” said Ramsey.\nThis seems to be going to plan as Babe has become something of a go-to delivery for Malaysians who are celebrating birthdays and anniversaries during lockdown.\n“We want to offer people some joy in these trying times, so we write messages to guests and put them in the delivery bag.” – Jeff Ramsey\nCOPPER\nCopper is a modern European restaurant run by husband-and-wife team, chef\xa0Chai Chun Boon and Zeehan Zahari.\nZahari explained that even the day prior to the MCO announcement, they saw an 80 per cent drop in business as companies within the building Copper is located had started to instruct their employees to work from home.\nUndaunted, the couple flipped the restaurant to serve the nation's medical frontliners, supported by crowdfunding from family and friends. “This has enabled us to make lunch and dinner boxes, which support the livelihood of our staff, farmers, producers and basically our F&B ecosystem,” stated Zahari. Her team’s journey is documented on her Instagram account @zeehanzahari.\nWhile this shift from doing fine cuisine to more of a production-type offering took a few days to get used to, Zahari admitted that it also took a bit of courage to step out of their comfort zone.\n“These days, the team cooks with whatever produce they can secure as delivery services are now limited. The kitchen team takes care to look into energy boosting ingredients and nutritional values to incorporate into the things that they make but honestly, nothing is really set and we have to improvise.”\n“[Crowdfunding] has enabled us to make lunch and dinner boxes, which support the livelihood of our staff, farmers, producers and basically our F&B ecosystem.” – Zeehan Zahari\nDEWAKAN\nFor Dewakan, 2019 was a big year, having put Malaysia on the map by placing 46th on the Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants list. This groundbreaking Modern Malaysian restaurant also moved into a new plush central location (NAZA Tower) in December. Just three months in with the MCO taking effect, Dewakan has chosen to close and take this time to hone its skills.\n“With the MCO extension, we’re look at other avenues that will mitigate the [reduced] productivity but also lessen the impact of what is going on now because nobody wants to be inactive for four weeks running,” chef de cuisine and Dewakan founder Darren Teoh said.\nThis strategy has two prongs: The first is allowing staff with pending projects to work on those projects. These range from experimenting with juice pairings to R&D on chocolate products. The second aspect is rolling out a food kit delivery service, Cook Like Dewakan, that allows home-bound gourmands to prepare their own Dewakan-style meals at home.\n“We wanted something that would play on our strengths and still be true to our brand. So we’re going to put our condiments, pastes and sauces into food boxes and supply them with the proper produce like a piece of goat meat that has been braised in an interesting sauce with instructions. This is our way of bringing a bit of us into their home,” Teoh explained.\nDespite the challenges that this pandemic will wreak on the economy, Teoh is firm in his belief that his team can weather the crisis. “We’ve come from a rough patch in our previous location where a slow night isn’t foreign to us. What that has taught us is to be prepared and to pay attention to our product and allow our product to do the talking,” he affirmed.\nHaving trained an agile team that can adapt to whatever uncertainty comes next, Teoh is raring to start cooking again when the situation improves. And when that happens, he forsees that it will be “business as usual but on hyperdrive.”\n“We wanted something that would play on our strengths and still be true to our brand. So we’re going to put our condiments, pastes and sauces into food boxes and supply them with proper produce.” – Darren Teoh\nDC RESTAURANT/BREF\nDC Restaurant and Bref are two of KL’s most feted restaurants, the former a fine dining manifestation of proprietor and chef de cuisine Darren Chin’s philosophy while the latter, its more casual sibling.\nGrounded in French techniques with an overlay of Japanese and Thai influences, Chin is a dedicated supporter of local produce and one of the F&B industry’s leaders. Since the MCO was announced, both restaurants have been shuttered.\n“DC and Bref are both gastronomic restaurants. We decided not to do takeaway or delivery meals because we can't guarantee the condition or presentation of the dishes. So we made the hard call to close entirely during the MCO period, and instead use this time for rest, reflection and research,” said Chin.\nChin, however, has been conducting live cooking demonstrations on his Facebook page where he reveals the secrets to his cooking techniques and applies these techniques to simple tasty recipes the home cook can follow. “All that’s needed is to follow the steps on my demonstrations!”\n“I think it's a bit like having your own personal chef, as much as you can during a MCO,” quipped Chin. Based on the positive feedback he received on Facebook, Chin has come up with a special takeaway menu, with items not available on the restaurants’ menus.\n“So far, we have done wagyu burgers, homemade pies, croissants, and recently Chiang Mai Khao Soi from an authentic recipe from my Thai mother-in-law,” he said.\n“DC and Bref are both gastronomic restaurants. We decided not to do takeaway or delivery meals… and instead use this time for rest, reflection and research.” – Darren Chin\nSITKA STUDIO\nSitka Studio in Damansara Heights is renowned for its inventive Friday night tasting menu, a laboratory of sorts for chef Christian Recomio and restauranteur Jenifer Kuah, who dish out intriguing interpretations of modern Asian cuisine.\nSince the MCO, Sitka started out trying to do takeaways but ceased soon after as they wanted to guarantee the safety of their staff and felt it would be irresponsible to risk it.\nKuah instead channelled her team’s energies into feeding the city’s healthcare frontliners. “Chefs feel their best when feeding people. We started by cooking for the team at BIG supermarket at Jalan Batai, a simple meal of rice, boiled egg, sambal fish and stir fried vegetables – Malaysian comfort food,” said Kuah.\n“Working with government-approved NGOs, we will be producing 200 meals a day using surplus produce from April 2 to April 11, with financial support from friends. Many will be going hungry with the extension of the order and we want to help where we can.”\n“Working with government-approved NGOs, we will be producing 200 meals a day using surplus produce from April 2 to April 11, with financial support from friends. Many will be going hungry with the extension of the order and we want to help where we can.” – Jenifer Kuah\nSOLIDARITY IN THE F&B COMMUNITY\nAmid the uncertainty – speculation is rife about whether the Malaysian government will extend the MCO until April 28 – there seems to be a sense of solidarity among these restauranteurs and chefs about not going down without a fight for what they have painstakingly built.\nTeoh summed it up: “I don’t think there’s ever a good time for a pandemic. It is what it is and a situation will affect us, the way it does but at the end of the day, I think it’s just about grit and determination. It’s about protecting and taking care of the people you work with and making sure that despite all of it, it’s not just one person that comes through but the whole team.”\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Malaysia ', '     F&B ', '     food ', '     Restaurants ', '     COVID-19 ', '     coronavirus ', '     Fine dining ']}"

      F&amp;B businesses to receive support for food delivery orders with new Enterprise Singapore booster package
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Food and beverage (F&B) businesses with delivery orders will receive support from a new Enterprise Singapore booster package.\nThe package comes as the COVID-19 situation in Singapore develops, impacting the sales and profitability of such businesses, Enterprise Singapore said in a news release on Saturday (Apr 4).\nThe Food Delivery Booster Package will reduce the business costs of selling on three key food delivery platforms – Deliveroo, foodpanda and GrabFood. This package will support both new entrants and existing ones on these platforms.\nOn Friday, the Ministry of Health (MOH) issued additional measures to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus, only allowing essential services and related supply chain activities to continue.\nIn line with this, F&B outlets can open only for takeaway and/or delivery from Apr 7 to May 4. Dine-in services will not be allowed.\n“With the additional measures, sales and profitability of F&B outlets would be impacted due to the drop in dine-in sales and the associated costs of using online food delivery platforms,” Enterprise Singapore said.\nThere is also expected to be a higher demand for food deliveries, the agency’s deputy CEO Mr Ted Tan said.\n“With the implementation of stricter safe distancing measures, the demand for food delivery is expected to increase significantly, by as much as two to three times as compared to previous months,” he explained.\nTo help lower business costs from delivery and takeaway operations for F&B businesses, Enterprise Singapore will fund five percentage points of the commission cost charged by the above three delivery platforms.\nThere will be no cap on the qualifying food delivery transaction value, it said.\n“In the immediate term, the Food Delivery Booster Package will help manage the business costs of F&B businesses for food delivery orders so that they can stay open for business and adapt their operations accordingly,” Mr Tan said.\n“This is also a good time for businesses to optimise their business models for online sales.”\nTo be eligible for the Food Delivery Booster Package, F&B businesses must sell food that was prepared on-premise for immediate consumption, the agency said, adding that this includes smaller establishments like hawker stalls and cafes, and larger ones like food caterers and restaurants.\nF&B businesses already on any of the three food delivery platforms are eligible for the package and do not need to apply. For the rest, they can approach the platforms to find out more.\nGRABFOOD\xa0WELCOMES MOVE \nGrabFood, one of the participating food delivery platforms, welcomed the Food Delivery Booster Package, saying it complements existing measures the platform has already put in place.\n“In the last few weeks, we have refined our merchant onboarding programme and ramped up our operations such that more F&B and daily essentials merchants can list themselves and start their new digital businesses on GrabFood and GrabMart platforms quickly,” Dilip Roussenaly, head of GrabFood Singapore shared.\n“GrabFood will also allow our new merchants to defer payment of their account activation fee, which starts from S$100 and offset it via food orders.\n“We hope that all of these efforts will collectively help support our merchant-partners through this challenging period.”\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\n', 'related_topics': ['     COVID-19 ', '     health ', '     food ']}"

      Commentary: Eating disorders are about emotional pain – not food
  </h1>, 'text': 'CARLISLE, Pennsylvania: In her documentary Miss Americana, music icon Taylor Swift disclosed her history of eating disorders.\nHer revelation underscores the fact these disorders do not discriminate. According to the advocacy and awareness organisation Eating Disorders Coalition, they strike all genders, races, ethnicities and socioeconomic backgrounds.\nDespite their prevalence – the problem is worldwide – myths about eating disorders abound. Such as that they are a choice. They are not. Or they’re not a big deal. They are. Or that a person with an eating disorder is always severely underweight. Not always.\nAs a licensed psychologist and psychology professor, I find it’s common for my clients and students to say “A little food helps me with my anxiety” or “I’m not thin enough to have an eating disorder”.\nSuch beliefs often prevent people from recognising they have a problem. More is involved in an eating disorder than food, or body image. Someone gripped by one is attempting to regulate some very difficult and complicated emotions.\nWHAT IS AN EATING DISORDER?\nEating disorders fall into three basic categories: Disorders of restriction, or anorexia; bingeing, known medically as binge eating disorder; and bingeing followed by compensation – such as self-induced vomiting – which is called bulimia.\nUnpacked further: Restriction means limiting calories so much that weight loss is more than expected for a given height and weight.\nThis does not necessarily mean the person will appear emaciated. Someone who was at the 90th percentile for weight, for example, could still be considered anorexic if they reduced their weight to the 70th percentile.\nBingeing is more than simply overeating. It’s out-of-control eating, leading to extreme feelings of fullness and guilt, typically within a couple of hours after a meal. By bingeing, a person can check out of life circumstances to focus only on food.\nWith bulimia, a binge is followed by an action to compensate for the calories consumed. Purging is one of them, but there are others, including exercise, particularly when it’s taken to an extreme.\nAlthough exercise is often overlooked as a form of compensation, a person addicted to it has more than three-and-a-half times the likelihood to be diagnosed with an eating disorder than a person a without one.\nIt should be emphasised that not all of these disorders always result in weight loss. Those with binge eating disorder and bulimia may be at or above expected weight.\nTHE ROOT OF AN EATING DISORDER\nEating disorders aren’t about managing weight. Rather, they’re a way to manage emotions. When my clients describe what it’s like to restrict themselves from food, they often talk of being “empty” and feeling “numb” to the world.\nTake someone dealing with a trifecta of guilt, shame and embarrassment. Bingeing is exceedingly effective at burying these emotions.\nSo is compensation, a tool to give the sufferer a break from the emotional turmoil. The relief they receive is a reinforcer, and it’s extraordinarily powerful. Purging, overeating, compensating – it all feels good. Very quickly, the pattern is repeated.\nSOME ANSWERS\nSimply changing eating patterns won’t work. Instead, sufferers must first identify the feelings they’re experiencing. Then comes a search for better strategies to deal with those feelings.\nIn the interim, nothing feels as good as the eating disorder. But slowly, as healthy behaviours take over, they become more reinforcing than the disorder.\nThere’s one thing you need to remember if you know someone with an eating disorder. They are experiencing significant emotional pain; the eating disorder is an attempt to communicate that pain.\nIf food or exercise appears to be running the life of a family member, friend or colleague, you can help by focusing on them and their lived experience – and not exclusively on the food.\nMichele Patterson Ford is Lecturer in Psychology at Dickinson College.

      300 million children missing school meals due to virus closures: World Food Programme
  </h1>, 'text': 'GENEVA: Around\xa0300 million children who depend on school meals are missing out due to closures triggered by the coronavirus pandemic, the World Food Programme said Friday (Mar 20).\nThe WFP pointed out that more than 860 million children -\xa0roughly half the world\'s student population - were having to stay away from schools and universities due to shutdowns aimed at halting the spread of COVID-19.\nIn addition to missing out on learning, hundreds of thousands of children are now missing free school lunches, the UN agency said.\nThe WFP said nearly nine million children out of the 18 million the organisation itself feeds through school meals across 61 countries were no longer receiving them.\nThe agency said it was looking into alternative ways of providing children out of school with food, including take-home meals.\n""Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, some 300 million primary schoolchildren are now missing out on school meals on which they depend,"" WFP spokeswoman Elisabeth Byrs told reporters in an online briefing from Geneva.\nShe warned that the number of children deprived of WFP-provided school meals ""is set to rise in coming days and weeks"".\n""In countries where schools are closed, WFP is evaluating possible alternatives.\n""This includes providing take-home rations in lieu of the meals, home delivery of food and provision of cash or vouchers,"" she said.\nByrs stressed that without alternative solutions, many children around the world blocked from attending school would otherwise go hungry.\nShe said the idea of take-home rations would benefit not only children but their families too.\nThe governments of wealthy countries such as the United States, Britain, France and Canada have adopted special mechanisms to ensure that their poorest schoolchildren will not go hungry.\nBut the situation is much more precarious for children living in countries plagued by extreme poverty, armed conflict, and whose health systems are weak or almost non-existent.\n""We can shift to online learning, but not online eating.

      Malaysian hawker sends wonton mee ‘flying’ for full flavour
  </h1>, 'text': 'PETALING JAYA: Mr Lee Wan Hiong dipped a wire sieve into a boiling pot of water and fished a bundle of egg noodles out.\nThe noodles were dripping hot water, but not for long.\nWith a casual flick of the forearm and wrist, born of a decade of practice, Mr Lee easily tossed the bundle of noodles high into the air and deftly caught it in his sieve.\nHe then transferred the noodles to a bowl, ladled a good helping of lard and shallot oil as well as dark sauce over the springy strands, and gave them a good mix. The plating was complete with a decent serving of char siew and blanched choy sum, with a separate bowl of wonton dumplings in soup.\nThe stall’s name, Flying Wan Tan Mee, says it all for Mr Lee, 45, who has been plying his trade for the past 13 years. He first operated a street stall, before shifting to his present location at Paramount Kopitiam in Seapark, Petaling Jaya in late January this year.\n“The higher you toss, the more hot water gets dispersed. So when you mix the noodles into the gravy, they absorb better, the overall taste doesn’t feel watered down,” he explained to CNA.\nINSPIRED BY WASHING MACHINE\nWhen he first started selling wonton mee, Mr Lee operated from a parking lot at night, setting up a few folding tables and plastic chairs for customers to have a quick roadside dinner.\nThe moniker of “flying noodles” came about as he wanted to drain the water from the egg noodles faster. He did not foresee it becoming his trademark that would help him gain a loyal following.\xa0\nMr Lee said he got his inspiration from washing machines, which spin in high speed to remove excess water from the laundry.\n\n\nHe showed off his “battle scar”, a large white callus on his wrist, formed where the wooden handle of the sieve keeps rubbing against his wrist thanks to countless plates of noodles he has prepared.\xa0\nThe odd mishap still occurs sometimes, where he fails to catch the noodles in time.\n“It’s very rare, but I’m only human. Usually it’s because my attention is divided, when I’m cooking and have to attend to the customers, or I have to manage my workers at the same time,” Mr Lee laughed.\nTHE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nWonton mee, a common Chinese hawker food, is available all over Malaysia.\nThe coffee shop Mr Lee moved into already has a wonton mee stall, and they have made arrangements so that the latter operates in the morning, while he takes the evening shift.\n“It’s the little details, maybe that final 10 per cent of the process, that make all the difference,” he shared.\nNinety per cent of the work is the same for every other wantan mee seller, like the composition of the dish, the flow of cooking and putting it together.\xa0\n\n\nThe “little details” he meant include slowly cooking pieces of lard in a large wok of oil, until the oil has absorbed the pork flavour. Likewise, another wok is filled with chopped shallots, slowly cooking until they become crisp.\n“I have to make sure the fire is small to moderate. It takes longer to cook, but it also gives the lard and the shallots more time to infuse the oil,” Mr Lee explained.\xa0\nA lot of the condiments are made daily. So is the char siew, which Mr Lee roasts in two large metal ovens over charcoal fire.\nA foodie himself, Mr Lee has expanded into selling chicken rice as well, using the same charcoal ovens to roast his chickens.\xa0\nSIDE HUSTLE TURNED DAY JOB\nWhen Mr Lee first started his stall - originally a\xa0side hustle for him to indulge his hobby of cooking and eating - he sold 60 plates a night. And then business just kept growing.\n“I found myself spending more and more time on it, and I gave up my landscaping job,” he explained.\nBefore moving to his current location, his roadside stall was doing over 300 plates a night.\nNow, work starts from 9am each morning, well before his stall opens from 3pm till 11pm.\xa0A small portion of his wonton mee costs RM7.50 (US$1.76).\n“Returning customers have given this new place the thumbs-up because it’s in a coffee shop, it’s well-lit, and you aren’t at the mercy of the weather.\n“And because you’re not seated by the roadside, it’s safer,” Mr Lee smiled.\xa0\n\n\nAs for how long he sees his business continuing, Mr Lee gave himself\xa0another 10 years or so.\n“I think after that, I’d like to go back to landscape and horticulture, or maybe open my own shop where I can still cook, but at a much more relaxed pace,” Mr Lee said.\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     Malaysia ', '     food ']}"

      Singapore’s fish balls could get unhealthier in the near future
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: Fish balls are not only a staple in Singapore’s hawker landscape, they are also one of Singaporeans’ two most favourite processed foods, according to the first study of its kind here.\nNearly 8,000 Singaporeans ranked fish balls alongside chicken nuggets in the survey of ultra-processed foods conducted by the Singapore Management University in collaboration with the programme Talking Point.\nAnd of all the fish that fish balls here are made from, the one that a lot of Singaporeans prefer the taste of, said Randall Ang, is itoyori (threadfin bream).\nThat is what goes into the fish paste, or surimi, used in the BoBo brand of fish balls produced by Ha Li Fa, where Ang is the business development director.\nHis company, one of the largest among the 30-plus makers of fish balls in Singapore, imports this paste from a few countries in the region.\nOne of them — one of the top three sources of Singapore’s surimi — is Vietnam, which exported 9,300 tonnes of it to Singapore in 2018.\nTo find out what exactly goes into this paste, and why Singaporeans are so hungry for fish balls, programme host Steven Chia visited Vietnam.\nWhat he learned was that Singaporeans’ fish balls could get unhealthier in future because of a dwindling supply of itoyori.\nWATCH: What's really in my fishballs? (24:02)\nTHE COST OF OVERFISHING\nFrom 2018 to last year, sales of processed meat and seafood products increased by 10 per cent at Singapore’s largest supermarket chain, FairPrice.\nBut in Vietnam, the fish wholesalers at Tac Cau Wharf in Kien Giang province — one of the busiest wharfs in the Mekong delta — said the haul of itoyori has dropped by about 40 per cent in the past three years.\nThe reason is overfishing. Over the years, fishermen had been increasing their catch to make more money, resulting in fewer fish in their waters now.\nWith the supply dropping, itoyori prices have increased by about 50 per cent over the past three years for Li Chuan Food Products, a fish ball and surimi factory in southern Vietnam that exports mostly to Singapore.\nIt produces surimi made from pure itoyori as well as surimi that comes from a mix of different fish, which costs less.\nBut because it has been able to absorb the price increase by eliminating middlemen costs, said general manager Tan Han Wei, most of its exports to Singapore are still made from pure itoyori.\nOther fish ball manufacturers, however, may mix other kinds of surimi with itoyori surimi or use lower-grade fish to lower the cost, he warned.\n“The final step they may be (taking) would be to reduce the fish meat content,” he added. “They could be adding a bit more water … (and) starch to lower the cost.”\nAs the supply of itoyori continues to fall, this means a higher chance that fish balls sold in Singapore may have more mixed surimi or more starch than before.\nA LOOMING ‘DISASTER’?\nCurrently, the amount of fish meat in Ha Li Fa’s BoBo fish balls ranges from 50 to nearly 100 per cent. Starch, water, ice and seasoning make up the rest of the fish ball.\nThis complies with Singapore Food Agency regulations, which state that fish balls sold here must contain at least 40 per cent fish meat.\nThe packaging of some of the fish balls sold in supermarkets, however, does not show the proportion of meat and type of fish used.\nAnd the problem with fish balls that contain more starch is that they contain more carbohydrates than fish balls with 100 per cent itoyori surimi, said dietitian Jaclyn Reutens from Aptima Nutrition and Sports Consultants.\n“People who are diabetic need to watch their carbohydrate and starch intake,” she noted. She is especially concerned, however, about what other additives there are inside the fish ball.\nFor example, one fish ball could have about 50 to 70mg of sodium, she said.\nThat is about 300 to 400mg of sodium from eating five to seven fish balls in one sitting, which she cautioned is a “significant” percentage of the 2,000mg of sodium a person should have a day.\nSome fish ball manufacturers do add flavour enhancers like monosodium glutamate (MSG), pointed out Jerome Lim, who manages fish ball noodle chain Ming Fa Fishball. But there is no good substitute for itoyori surimi up to now, he said.\n“No other fish can have the same texture,” he added, lamenting the possibility of a dwindling supply. “If that's the case, we’d have to fall back on (fish balls with more starch). Then I think there’d be a disaster.”\nWatch this episode of Talking Point here.

      Grow meat at home from stem cells? It’s coming, says Shiok Meats CEO
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: What if you are able to “grow” your own meat at home? Would it change the way your family eat?\nThe idea is not in the realms of science fiction any more, according to stem cell scientist Sandhya Sriram.\nShe envisions that people could have a small bioreactor — “a fancy name” for something like a pressure cooker — that can maintain the right temperature and conditions for cells to grow into meat.\n“It’s much like making beer or wine at home, or even baking a piece of bread,” says the 35-year-old.\nIt is already happening in Japan, where there are biohackers trying their hand at developing DIY meat at home through the Shojinmeat Project, a citizen science project.\nSandhya knows more than most about this technology and how to make cultured meats. She is the co-founder and chief executive officer of Shiok Meats, the homegrown company growing cell-based shrimps in a laboratory.\nShe gives it 10 years before people can “have this kind of set-up in their house for them to make meats”.\nMeantime, consumers here will get a taste of things to come when her company starts selling its shrimp to restaurants next year, she discloses.\n“So you can walk into a restaurant that we’re partnering to basically buy a shrimp siew mai dish or shrimp fried rice or a shrimp soup dish.”\nIt has been 18 months since Shiok Meats began as the first cell-based clean meat company in Singapore. And it is unlikely to be the last.\nFOR NOW, IT’S S$150 A SIEW MAI\nGrowing meat in a lab is cutting-edge technology being attempted by a handful of companies around the globe.\nTheir labs have successfully made hamburger patties and shrimp dumplings, but these are not yet commercially available because a tiny amount of cell-based meat costs thousands of dollars. Last year, it cost Shiok Meats S$5,000 to produce eight dumplings.\nThat has since come down to S$5,000 for a kilogramme of shrimp meat. In other words, each siew mai would set you back S$150.\n\n\nBy year end or the start of next year, however, it will be a “two- to three-digit number” per kilogramme.\nAnd that has to do with the biological research her start-up is doing, says Sandhya, who earned her PhD from the Nanyang Technological University.\nWATCH: Lab-grown meat, in Singapore restaurants in 2021 (& at home by 2030)? (2:41)\nAt heart of the technology, what her company does is to take out stem cells from live shrimps and grow the cells “over and over again” by feeding them a liquid nutrient, or “nutrient soup”.\n“It’s a mix of proteins, carbohydrates and fats, very similar to what the animal would eat itself. But because the cells don’t have a digestive system, you have to give them a very simple ingredient mix,” she explains.\n“It’s made only by pharmaceutical companies. It’s not made by anyone else in larger quantities for us to purchase, hence the cost. So 90 per cent of our multi-thousand-dollar kilogramme per shrimp is the price of that nutrient solution.”\nThe pharma companies do not reveal what is in this proprietary substance, “but to an extent, we as scientists definitely know”, she says.\nAnd by swapping some of the pharmaceutical-grade ingredients for plant-based and edible ingredients, Shiok Meats has reduced the cost. “We haven’t found an exact alternative for the rest. So now we have to start working on those,” she adds.\n“We’re getting there ... It’s been only 18 months since we started, but we’re quite positive that we’ll launch commercially next year in Singapore.”\nSTART OF A REVOLUTION\nWhile cell-based meats come from an animal, what has recently taken the world by storm are plant-based meats. They are, to an extent, direct competitors in the market, acknowledges Sandhya.\n“But honestly, (in 2050) the world’s population is going to be 10 billion ... We don’t even have enough food to feed the seven billion that we are currently,” she says.\n“You need different sources of food ... So I believe that a mix of plant-based, cell-based and insect-based protein is going to be the future. It’s already started.”\nTo consumers who might think that cell-based meats are slightly like Frankenstein food, she points out that “most of your packaged food that you get in a supermarket now” were made in labs “at one point in time”.\n“Then it goes out of the lab and goes into ... a food manufacturing facility,” she adds. “That’s exactly what we’re doing with cell-based meats.”\nShiok Meats is setting up its manufacturing facility this year, specifically for shrimp. And it plans to grow cell-based crabs and lobsters after that.\nBut does its shrimp, when cooked, really smell and taste like shrimp meat to begin with?\nThe first time the start-up did a blind test, Sandhya got her co-founder and a chef in a culinary school to do the tasting and “they couldn’t tell the difference”, she recounts. “The flavour is inherent.”\nThe only thing is that the company cannot make “a structured shrimp” right now. “It’s minced, hence the dumpling. But we’re working towards a shrimp that will look like the real thing,” she says.\nShe herself, as a vegetarian, had never eaten shrimp before that, “so you can imagine that it’ll take me a while to get used to the taste”.\n“But I know that I can eat it without any guilt ... I know where exactly it comes from and I know that we’ve made it,” she adds, citing “clean shrimp farms” as the source of the stem cells.\n“We take those shrimps that are not treated with antibiotics (nor) bleach, (and) don’t have heavy metals or mercury.”\nShiok Meat also runs its final product by third-party organisations that do accredited testing for those components.\nAnd even before the company can take its meat to restaurants, let alone people growing their own meat, Sandhya thinks the world is already witnessing a revolution with people talking about cell-based meats.\n“(This) is very, very important because for us ... consumer education is more important than getting the product to market so fast. Because we have to educate consumers as to why they have to choose this product,” she says.\nWatch the full exclusive interview here.

      This Singaporean chef wants to usher in a new age of Asian cuisine
  </h1>, 'text': 'If there’s one thing chef Ace Tan has in spades, it’s ambition. Three years ago, along with chef and business partner David Lee, he opened a fine-dining restaurant of lofty scale; one that even far more established chefs would think thrice about.\nThe restaurant had all the trappings of a big-name fine-diner: Two-storey shophouse, sombre dining room, starched tablecloths and a unique cuisine they labelled New Asian, which essentially translated to Asian ingredients parsed to fit into the traditional Western fine dining format.\nWhen Restaurant Ards – an acronym for Asia, Roots, Distinct, Singular – shut barely six months later, few pundits were surprised. The duo lacked the experience, maturity and recognition needed for a project of that scale to succeed.\nBut that was then. Now 38, Tan recently returned to Singapore’s dining scene after a year-long stint as executive sous chef at Michelin-listed Flowerchild Restaurant in Seoul.\nToday, at the newly minted 1-V:U (pronounced “one view”) Day Club and Restaurant at the rooftop of Sentosa’s The Outpost Hotel, where he has taken the mantle of head chef, Tan looks relaxed, confident and ready to usher in his new brand of Asian cuisine that he hopes other chefs will embrace as well.\nFIND A WAY, OR MAKE ONE\n“Ards was a good learning experience,” he said reflectively. “We thought that as long as the food had a point, success would come if we persevered. But that didn’t translate to good business. We realised that a two-storey fine dining restaurant in Duxton was a challenge to sustain, especially in Singapore where the competition is tough. David and I didn’t feel like the cuisine was a failure; we just weren’t mature enough to understand the business.”\nAt 36 years old when Ards closed, Tan could not be considered a young chef. But he’d had a late start in an industry where many chefs begin their careers from as young as their teenage years. His passion for cooking was ignited when he found himself watching cooking shows round the clock after taking a break from his advertising job at age 27. With no culinary experience to speak of, he wrote to fine dining restaurants across Singapore asking for a job. Not one replied.\nUndeterred, he walked into a mid-range mall restaurant and asked if they would hire him. “I knew I had to start somewhere. I just wanted them to give me a job; they didn’t have to pay me,” he recalled. Naturally, they said yes. The next year was spent working from the ground up, washing rice, making salads, chopping onions and peeling potatoes. In the years since, Tan has worked his way up from mall restaurant to higher-end mall restaurant, to mid-range standalone restaurant, and eventually the likes of acclaimed establishments like Pollen and Les Amis.\n“Ards was a good learning experience. We thought that as long as the food had a point, success would come if we persevered. But that didn’t translate to good business.” – Ace Tan\nLOOKING INWARDS\nTime and experience hasn’t tempered Tan’s passion for redefining Asian cuisine. Over the last 18 months, he has thrown himself into gleaning a deeper understanding of the origins of Asian food and questioning what he thinks he knows.\nHe has since parlayed that knowledge into a new dining experience, one rooted in a solid identity and the desire to connect with people through food. “I don’t need the white tablecloths and five servers around each table checking on what cutlery diners have anymore,” he said. “The food just has to be good.”\n1-V:U which is owned by the 1-Group, which is behind concepts like Stellar at 1-Altitude and Monti – comprises a breezy day club and an adjoining restaurant appointed with an open kitchen, sumptuous wicker chairs and teal sofas. Here, Tan serves a menu that is described as a “bold, progressive take on North-East Asian cuisine”. The food is served communal-style, even if you order the tasting menu.\nHappily, Tan manages to harmoniously meld influences from all over the region, such as in a starter of Indian puri shells filled with diced yellowtail sashimi tossed in a korma, coconut and lime dressing, or a hot French bean and wing bean salad dressed in an Indonesian bumbu sauce and natto.\nIf there’s anything he’s learnt in the last couple of years, it is that people need to recognise what they are eating in order to understand the food. “At Ards, we experimented with a lot of fusion components and called it ‘New Asian’. Now I’m calling it ‘Progressive Asian’ as I designed a menu where people who are not from Asia can recognise what they are eating without the servers having to explain too much to them. That is the starting point of the progression.\n“As we progress, I want to strip away my dependence on French and western techniques and instead use what I’ve learnt from my travels to Korea, for example, to improve the identity of the cuisine so that it can evolve into its own persona. People won’t question whether it’s east or west, or what percentage of each is in the food. It can stand on its own as a new form of Asian cooking.”\nLittle effort has been spared in his research, from experimenting with making his own koji and soy sauce, to learning the history behind now quotidian Asian condiments such as oyster sauce. “For our cuisine to be stronger, we need to understand our history. I’m trying to extract different parts of Asia and combine them in my dishes.”\n“For our cuisine to be stronger, we need to understand our history. I’m trying to extract different parts of Asia and combine them in my dishes.” – Ace Tan\nASIA MAJOR \nWhere many chefs have looked to the western world for inspiration, Tan wants to turn the focus back to Asia. “The region is so big and I think it’s important to find out what’s happening in Asia, and not so much about what’s happening in the west. I want people to see Asia in a new light through my Asian cuisine.\n“What I want to achieve eventually is to inspire a new generation of Asian chefs to create their own version of Asian cuisine. I hope to build a community of Asian chefs with different perspectives, who will open themselves to researching Asian culture.”\nTo that end, he is planning collaboration dinners with other Asian chefs so that they can learn from one another, but the most pressing matter at hand is getting diners to come to the restaurant which opened just as the COVID-19 outbreak hit Singapore.\n“Our timing could not have been worse,” Tan said with a smile, “but I’ve told my staff that this is a good time for us to settle in and concentrate on doing our research.” Evidently, with this endeavour, Tan is amply prepared.\n“What I want to achieve eventually is to inspire a new generation of Asian chefs to create their own version of Asian cuisine. I hope to build a community of Asian chefs with different perspectives, who will open themselves to researching Asian culture.” – Ace Tan\n', 'related_topics': ['     Singapore ', '     Chefs ', '     food ', '     Restaurants ', '     Asia ', '     Profiles ']}"

There’s the ever popular Sakura Matsuri spring festival – unfortunately cancelled this year because of the pandemic –\xa0where visitors\xa0gather in Japan’s many scenic parks to celebrate the dawn of the cherry blossom season.\nLesser known, to most Singaporeans at least, is the Hina Matsuri, or doll festival, a day in which families celebrate their daughters and wish them good health and happiness.\xa0\nDuring Hina Matsuri, which takes place on March 3 every year, families display ceramic dolls in their homes, dressed in ornate robes of the ancient imperial court.

Fine-dining Japanese restaurant Mikuni, located in Fairmont Singapore, is celebrating Hina Matsuri with a\xa0bento lunch set menu (S$138++ per person) available from now till March 14. The dishes are crafted with women in mind, served in a wooden lacquered box.\nWith a total of six courses, Mikuni's bento set lunch is a lavish affair conceptualised by Chef Keisuke Uno.\nAt a recent tasting, the\xa0meal began with Japanese Oyster from Mie Prefecture, topped with umami-packed dashi foam. This particular oyster however, was unavailable at the tasting, and was instead replaced by an\xa0Irish oyster. We weren’t too disappointed, however, as the oyster tasted just as fresh and creamy.\nAfter the oyster came the true star of the show. As the bento box was placed before us, we were pleasantly surprised by its size. Among\xa0the six courses was an array of sashimi with otoro (fatty tuna), Tai (Japanese sea bream) and Kampachi (amberjack).\nOur favourite was the Tempura Prawn Yuba, Sweet Potato and Shishitou peppers, accompanied by a dip of sea salt. Instead of flour tempura, the prawn was fried with with yuba (tofu) skin for a unique texture.\nThe Stanbroke Wagyu Tenderloin was also pleasantly tender. The meat is\xa0sourced from the Stanbroke company, which combines the finest Japanese Wagyu with the supreme quality of Australian beef. The tenderloin is slow cooked at 54°C in Mikuni’s housemade teriyaki sauce.\xa0\nOther menu highlights include Barracuda served with rice. While we couldn’t quite appreciate the briny taste of the fish, others at the table\xa0named this particular dish their favourite from the bento box.\nAs with most Japanese meals, the lunch set comes with a hearty, flavourful and comforting miso soup with\xa0asari clams.\xa0Rounding up the meal was a rose tea jelly dessert, made to look like a raindrop, with strawberry-flavoured yuzu sauce. This was light and refreshing, and the addition of crushed matcha bits gave the dish just a little bit of crunch.\nThe Hina Matsuri Menu is available\xa0from now till March 14, 12pm to 2.30pm at Mikuni, Fairmont Singapore.\xa0\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Japan ', '     food ', '     gastronomy ', '     Fine dining ']}"

      What really is in the chicken nuggets you like so much
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: When it comes to ultra-processed food, chicken nuggets are the top choice for Singaporeans, according to a survey commissioned by programme Talking Point.\nAnd almost two in three of those surveyed said they started eating ultra-processed food before the age of 13.\nBut what does eating chicken nuggets consistently from a young age do to children?\nOne problem with consuming more processed food from young — which food scientist Yang Hongshun agrees is the case now compared with 20 years ago — is that this increases one’s threshold for salt and sugar.\n“When you try natural food, without the same amount of salt … colour, taste or smell, maybe you’d find that it’s not (tasty),” said the assistant professor from the National University of Singapore’s Food Science and Technology Department.\nWhile people know that ultra-processed foods are not good for them, what is it that makes chicken nuggets so addictive?\nThe programme Talking Point finds out what they are really made of and whether they are even unhealthier than people realise. (Watch the episode here.)\nVARYING GREATLY IN COMPOSITION\nIn the survey of nearly 8,000 Singaporeans, conducted by the Singapore Management University in collaboration with Talking Point, respondents said up to 30 per cent of their meals every week contained ultra-processed foods.\nThe study investigates local consumption patterns, attitudes and perceptions about ultra-processed foods.\nWATCH: What\'s really in my chicken nuggets (23:54)\nAnd it seems that many Singaporeans believe the rumour — even though it is unverified — that nuggets are made of unwanted parts of a chicken, like intestine, liver and even crushed bones, all minced into a paste.\nSo what exactly goes into the chicken nuggets in Singapore, where 4,400 tonnes were imported from countries like Thailand and Malaysia in 2018?\nNational University Hospital head of pathology Tan Soo Yong extracted samples of nuggets from five different brands and found that they did not contain organs such as liver, kidney or intestine.\nInstead, they were composed of muscle, fat, bits of bones and other tissue constituents including collagen, vessels and nerves, as well as vegetative material.\nThe amount of muscle, or what is commonly known as meat, in the samples ranged from 15 to 60 per cent. The muscle to fat ratio also differed greatly across brands, as different parts of the chicken meat were used.\n“What does surprise me … is the relative proportion of muscle versus fat in different brands,” said the associate professor.\n“If you’re on a diet … you might be interested to know what percentages of muscle and fat are present in your favourite chicken nugget.”\nTypically, chicken breast has the least fat, followed by the drumstick, wing and thigh. If these parts have their skin on, the fat content is higher.\nSODIUM OR FAT?\nTasty Meat Products, whose factory here produces more than 150,000 nuggets a day, uses meat from the drumstick and thigh because it is juicier and cheaper than chicken breast, which is reserved for premium products.\nIts managing director, Sunny Choo, said its nuggets contain about 65 per cent meat, but he has heard of manufacturers that use 20 per cent chicken meat.\nThe main ingredients of the company’s nuggets besides meat, he said, include textured vegetable protein (which is soya-based), chicken bouillon and modified starch. And the flavour is boosted by the nuggets’ coating, a machine-made combination of bouillon, starches and flours.\nThe proportions of all these ingredients depend on the manufacturer.\n“For instance, (if) you want a cheaper product, then you have to put more of this soya protein, (whose volume) you can inflate (by) two times (with) water,” said Choo. “It would reduce your cost.”\nNuggets made of meat from chicken leg are also cheaper, by 20 to 30 per cent, than those made from chicken breast. But they also contain more fat.\nEat Right Nutrition Consultancy principal dietitian Derrick Ong said nuggets with more fat tend to also have more saturated fat. But this does not necessarily mean nuggets with more fat are unhealthier.\nComparing the labels on some nuggets sold in supermarkets, he pointed out that the saturated fat level of one brand was 2.9 grammes per 100 g, “which is fairly low”, but its sodium level was 610 milligrammes.\nAnother brand had a lower sodium content, at 520 mg, even though it contained 4 g of saturated fat. “There’s kind of this trend,"" he said. “The higher the saturated fat, the sodium content tends to be lower.”\nThere is a trade-off between the “mouth feel” of the fats and the sodium flavour. “Neither is very good for health,” he added.\nToo much saturated fat can increase the risk of heart disease, but too much sodium can also increase the risk of hypertension and heart disease.\nBONDING MOMENTS\nBy eating six pieces of nuggets totalling 510 mg of sodium and 2.5 g of saturated fat, one would have consumed 25 per cent of the recommended daily intake of sodium and up to 15 per cent or so of the recommended intake of saturated fat.\nYet, the flavour can get people hooked early in life. Apart from that, nuggets stand out from other ultra-processed foods and is attractive to children because of the size.\n“It’s something that you can pop into your mouth easily,” said food blogger Alexis Cheong.\nFast food chains also play a part in inculcating this habit of serving nuggets to children from young by, for example, making it part of a meal to share and enjoy.\n“A lot of times we’re focused more on the bonding moments, instead of what (we) are eating and how processed or unhealthy it is,” she said. “As you grow up, it also becomes part of that wonderful memory you have.”\nSome fast food chains also periodically release new flavours or time- limited offers to keep consumers coming back for more.\n“With habit … all of that combined makes nuggets a really hard thing to resist,” she added.\nWatch this episode of Talking Point here.

      How 3D food printing can help the elderly
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: These days, 3D food printers are used in the industry to make chocolates and pastries.\nBut at Singapore Polytechnic, researchers are exploring the idea of printing food that the elderly crave, such as chilli crab and durian, but with a new twist.\n“(For) durian, we can reduce the sugar content and also fortify it … with calcium and vitamin D,” said Evelyn Ong, product innovation manager at the polytechnic’s Food Innovation and Resource Centre.\n“And we can reconstruct it using 3D food printing to a shape that looks familiar to the elderly.”\nWith 3D food printing, one can produce food that is not only palatable and healthier for the elderly, but also easier for them to chew.\nThis ability to print food has the potential to revolutionise the way we eat, by offering convenience as well as customisation in terms of texture and even nutrition, the programme Money Mind discovers. (Watch the episode here.)\nPRINTING MEALS FOR PATIENTS\n3D printing technology is not new, though it is usually associated with creating materials to build cars, planes and houses.\nBut after Russian cosmonauts printed meat in space in October — showing how useful the applications of 3D printing can be — food printing has gained traction.\nIt is a process whereby food materials (in paste or gel form) are extruded from cartridges to form layered designs programmed on a computer.\nAt the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), researchers are working to advance these methods, including developing a new kind of food ink, which can be used to maintain the food structure. It has properties similar to those of toothpaste.\nSome of the researchers are also working with Khoo Teck Puat Hospital to create printed meals for elderly and frail patients who have trouble swallowing food. These meals include sweet potatoes, pollack, green peas and even milk.\nThe hospital’s senior principal dietitian, Gladys Wong, is looking to get puree that is easy to swallow and can be produced consistently.\n“The food (must be) nutritious as well and, more importantly, be visually appealing (so) that the elderly patient or people (who had a) stroke are able to eat it and want to eat it,” she said.\nCarrot, bitter gourd, spinach and garden peas are among those printed by researchers, while chicken, fruits and rice are next on the agenda.\nIn Sweden, two cities are already testing a new food printing technique for eldercare homes. The idea is to stimulate residents’ appetites by making the pureed food look like the real thing.\nAt this moment, however, there is a limited range of food that can be printed, and scalability is also an issue, pointed out Ong. “It may take about 30 to 45 minutes just to print out a crab claw.\n“If you’re talking about mass-producing for different patients, it may take a much longer time, which isn’t feasible at this moment.”\nThere is also the issue of food safety regulations. While there are consortiums planning to do 3D food printing in the European Union, “there is no safe limit, or safe rules”, said Wong.\n“In Singapore, we also have to work with the regulatory bodies to come up with those regulations.”\nWATCH: 3D food printing desserts to hospital meals (2:45)\nSTAGE SET FOR A BOOM\nWith a price tag of about S$5,000, commercial 3D food printers are also out of reach of most people for now.\nBut some experts say it is only a matter of time before food printing becomes a game changer for food manufacturing and services.\nAnrich3D, a spin-off from the Nanyang Technological University, is now developing 3D food printing based on individual nutritional preferences. It aims to mass-produce personalised meals, such as burgers, pizzas and sandwiches, using apps and vending machines in future.\n“How much food we can print isn’t limited by the size of the printer,” said the start-up’s founder, Anirudh Agarwal.\n“We can continuously keep feeding material (to the printer) and use it in a large setting like a hotel, restaurant or even a manufacturing facility.”\nIn Japan, a food technology company came up with a restaurant concept last year to create 3D-printed sushi tailored to each diner based on the individual’s biological data.\nSUTD professor and head of Engineering Product Development, Chua Chee Kai, estimates that the 3D food printing market was worth about US$49 million (S$69 million) globally as of 2018.\nIt is expected to grow to US$400 million or more by 2024. In future, housewives as well as restaurants may be printing food, Chua said.\n“If you have printers, you need inks, and … it could be sugar, it could be all the different vegetables,” he added.\n“I think we’ll create a whole new generation of chefs who’ll be able to download recipes. I’d like to term this digital gastronomy.”\nWatch this episode of Money Mind here.

      Southern comfort: Okinawa comes to Singapore at this restaurant in the JW Marriott
  </h1>, 'text': 'Okinawan cuisine is hard to come by in Singapore. There is only one dedicated outpost – the longstanding Nirai-Kanai izakaya in Liang Court (and now Great World City, too). From time to time, a handful of Japanese restaurants might add Okinawan specialities to their repertoire.\nBut that’s about it, and that scarcity isn’t about to change. Japan’s southernmost prefecture remains a relatively niche destination for luxury travellers, although the opening of the Halekulani Okinawa last July could switch things up.\nWe were thrilled, then, to find out that modern Japanese restaurant Akira Back at JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach has a weeklong (alas!) offer touting this rare cuisine. The Flavours of Okinawa is a four-course dinner menu (S$85++ per person) available from today until Sunday, March 1.\nThe subtropical chain of islands that make up Okinawa – affectionately known as the Hawaii of Japan – boasts a food culture influenced by China, Japan and even Southeast Asia.\nOne of its most ubiquitous dishes, Champuru (from the Malay “campur”, or “mixed”), is a stir-fry consisting of ingredients that would not look out of place on a Chinese dinner table: Bittergourd, tofu, eggs and pork. Ditto the Rafute – pork belly braised in soy and brown sugar.\nOkinawan food tends toward the rustic and down-homey, which makes Akira Back’s finely-honed rendition all the more intriguing. It’s the work of Chef de Cuisine Tomoyuki Kiga, who was inspired by a visit to the islands’ local farms and fisheries in late 2019.\nKiga’s menu blends Okinawan ingredients with non-native cooking techniques. In Buri – the second course – he presents the amberjack fish (smoked with cherry wood) ceviche-style, using a shikuwasa vinaigrette. Shikuwasa is a small, green citrus fruit native to Okinawa and Taiwan.\nLike a ceviche, the dish has a refreshing, cleansing quality. It isn’t a palate cleanser, of course – the umami from the shiitake mushrooms takes care of that.\nContinuing the lightness in Rafute (the third course) is Kiga’s use of pork ribs in place of fattier pork belly. Braised in the traditional sauce of sake and brown sugar (an Okinawan speciality), the ribs are slow-cooked in a water bath for 48 hours, making the flesh tender enough to fall easily off the bone, yet firm enough to give it some bite.\nRichly flavoured, with a sweet-savoury-tart profile, the ribs are no less comforting to the palate than if pork belly were to be used.\nThat combination of sweet, savoury and tart is also present in the dessert, Mille Feuille, a sublime confection composed of strawberries, acerola cherry sorbet and Okinawan salted vanilla cream. The latter is an inspiration from a salted vanilla ice cream that Kiga tasted on his trip.\nWhile in Okinawa, Kiga also witnessed the local tradition of storing freshly-caught fish in ice with a sorbet-like consistency. Because of the “softer” ice, the integrity of the fish is maintained for longer, ensuring its freshness.\nThe first course, Katsuo – seared bonito marinated in Tosa soy sauce – exemplifies this. The flesh is delightfully springy, as if the fish had just been hauled in a few hours ago. A bed of compressed watermelon and tiny dollops of a kaffir lime-herb puree amplifies the freshness.\nAccording to a spokesperson from JW Marriott, Flavours of Okinawa is part of the Akira Back’s new approach for 2020, which is to offer seasonal selections based on ingredients from specialist growers and producers. In the past, the menu focused on “signatures” – a characteristic of the restaurant’s 16 global outposts.\nFlavours of Okinawa\xa0is the first seasonal menu for Singapore. As for what regulars – Korean-born Chef Back has a 40,500 following on Instagram (@chefakiraback) – can look forward to next is anybody’s guess. Upcoming menus are blank canvases for now.\nFlavours of Okinawa (S$85++ per person) is available from now until Sunday, March 1.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Restaurants ', '     Singapore ', '     food ', '     gastronomy ', '     Fine dining ']}"

      Tuna marrow, 'potatoes &amp; plankton': Dining at Raffles Hotel just got funkier
  </h1>, 'text': 'From the elegant Franco-Japanese stylings at La Dame de Pic to the satisfying pan-Chinese offerings at Yi by Jereme Leung, there is no shortage of dining options at Raffles Hotel.\nWhere does that leave Butcher’s Block – the newest kid on the block, which opened in January – then? The answer was revealed at a recent tasting.\nWith a name like Butcher’s Block, one might think that it’s a classic steakhouse. That’s only partly true: Fish and seafood are also served, making it more of a surf ’n’ turf joint, albeit one with polish.\nThe restaurant interior sets the mood: Timber rafters, Prussian blue columns with French mouldings, leather banquettes. It’s enough to transport one to a French provincial manor house.\nDiners can choose from an a la carte menu, or, for a special experience, they can opt for the OAK (One of a Kind) Table. Meant for a party of eight, this experience (S$398++ per guest) features off-the-menu specials and unlimited pours of four wines handpicked by Raffles Hotel’s head sommelier Eric Li, as well as the tableside theatrics of chef Remy Lefebvre.\nThe restaurant sources its beef from Australia, Ireland and Japan, ordering full carcasses so that the entire animal can be used. In Australia, Lefebvre works with Rangers Valley, a highly rated producer that prides itself on its genetically superior stock, procuring full bone-in loin Wagyu crossbreed WX MBS7+.\nFrom the Emerald Isles comes John Stone, a premium dry-aged Irish beef specialist that boasts pedigree cattle with traceable lineage. Here Lefebvre procures full loin bone-in cuts. In Japan, Lefebvre works exclusively with two small family farms, one in Saga (by Murata San) and one in Kagoshima (by Kusunoki San), which he believes produces “exceptional beef at the utmost quality”.\xa0\xa0\nOur five-course menu opened with a plump, hand-dived Norwegian scallop in a pepper sauce, alongside a roasted artichoke drizzled in a black vinegar dressing. We were floored by the soft, powdery texture of the artichoke, but found the scallop a tad too briny for our liking.\nNext was a duo of wagyu A5 and bluefin tuna, served in a red wine reduction infused with tuna blood. We were somewhat put off by the use of blood, and had to overcome the psychological barrier before tucking in.\nAs an accompaniment, this dish was paired with tuna marrow served in tuna vertebra. The marrow had an intriguing jelly-like consistency, very unlike the custardy texture of beef marrow. We might have warmed to this side dish were it not served in the vertebra – its resemblance to human vertebra was another psychological barrier to overcome.\nRegrettably, the aged wild turbot – grilled and dressed with sauce vierge, a French sauce composed of olive oil, lemon juice, chopped tomatoes, basil and red onion – was rather forgettable. Its flesh was firm but not particularly flavourful, though some might call it delicate. This was served alongside “Mitraille” potatoes and plankton, the latter imparting not as briny or exotic a quality as expected.\nThe meal’s saving grace came in the form of the Porterhouse steaks. We were given two versions, grain-fed and grass-fed, that were cooked to perfection. The former was delightfully buttery while the latter, nuanced with a complex flavour profile.\nThe four wines offered as part of the OAK Table experience are not meant as pairings. Instead, the idea is to let guests discover new sensations. The Library, an exposed wine cellar, houses more than 200 different wine labels, including a wide selection of natural wines.\nNot exactly fans of natural wines, we remained unconvinced by the New Zealand sauvignon blanc (Hermit Ram, 2018). Meanwhile\xa0the 2016 Chateau Martet, a merlot, was as expected. A pleasant surprise was to be found in a nero d’avola from Sicily (Azienda Agricola Cos, 2015), a blend local to the island. We were most won over by the champagne: A non-vintage, premier cru blanc de blancs from boutique producer Larmandier-Bernier.\nThe restaurant is open for dinner service (6pm to 10pm daily), but OAK Table is only available on Friday and Saturday evenings (reservations essential).\nbutchersblock.com.sg\n', 'related_topics': ['     Raffles Hotel ', '     Restaurants ', '     Singapore ', '     food ', '     gastronomy ', '     Fine dining ']}"

      Commentary: Chronic constipation is common but can be improved
  </h1>, 'text': ""NEWCASTLE: Chronic constipation is incredibly common. Around one in four people worldwide report symptoms, while in Australia and New Zealand, it’s around one in seven.\nLots of things can trigger constipation: Being out of your usual routine (think holidays, illness or injury), having a low fibre intake, not drinking enough water and inactivity.\nCertain medications can also cause constipation including iron supplements, painkillers, diuretics (to help you get rid of sodium and water), and other drugs to treat heart disease, mental health conditions and allergies.\nConstipation is more common in older adults and in women, due to hormonal changes that slow bowel motility – the time it takes for your body to digest food and expel the waste products (stools or bowel motions). Pregnant women are particularly prone to constipation.\nHOW DO YOU KNOW YOU'RE CONSTIPATED?\nSymptoms of constipation include lumpy or hard stools; feeling that your bowels haven’t emptied completely or your anus is blocked; straining to pass a bowel motion; manipulating your body position to try and pass a bowel motion, and having fewer than three bowel motions per week.\nIf over a three-month period you answer yes to two or more of these symptoms most weeks, then you have constipation.\nThe good news is it can be treated and then prevented.\nIf your bowels are so packed you can’t pass any bowel motions at all, see your GP. You may need treatment with specific laxatives to clear your bowels before you can start on a prevention plan.\nHere are four things that research shows improve bowel function, which refers to the time it takes for food to move through your digestive system and be expelled as a bowel motion (called gut transit time), the frequency and volume of bowel motions, and stool consistency.\nHIGH-FIBRE FOODS\nDietary ﬁbres are complex carbohydrates that aren’t digested or absorbed in the gut.\nDifferent types of dietary fibres improve bowel function through various processes. The fermentation of fibre in the colon produces water and other molecules, which make stools softer and easier to pass.\xa0\nThe absorption of water into stools stimulates the gut to contract and makes bowel motions softer. A higher fibre intake also creates bigger stools, which pass more quickly, resulting in more regular bowel motions.\nA good source of fibre is psyllium. It forms a viscous gel, which gets fermented in the colon, leading to softer bowel motions. Psyllium is the main ingredient in Metamucil, which is commonly used to treat constipation.\nA review comparing the effect of psyllium to wheat bran in people with chronic constipation found psyllium was 3.4 times more effective at increasing the amount of stool passed.\nThis is important because having a bigger bowel motion waiting in the colon to be passed sends signals to your gut that it’s time to expel the stool – and it helps the gut contract to do just that.\nThe review found both psyllium and coarse wheat bran had a stool-softening effect, but finely ground wheat bran had a stool-hardening effect.\nOther foods rich in fermentable carbohydrates include dark rye bread and legumes (chickpeas, lentils, four-bean mix, red kidney beans, baked beans); while wholemeal and wholegrain breads and cereals are high in different types of dietary fibres.\nKIWI FRUIT\nKiwi fruit fibre absorbs about three times its weight in water. This means it helps make stools softer and boosts volume by increasing the amount of water retained in bowel motions. This stimulates the gut to contract and moves the bowel motions along the gut to the anus.\nIn a study of 38 healthy older adults, researchers found adding two to three kiwi fruit per day to their diets for three weeks resulted in participants passing bowel motions more often. It also increased the size of their stools and made them softer and easier to pass.\nKiwi fruit are also rich in the complex carbohydrate inulin a type of fructan. Fructans are a prebiotic fibre, meaning they encourage growth of healthy bacteria in the colon.\nBut fructans can also aggravate symptoms in some people with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). If you have IBS and constipation, check in with your GP before upping your fructan intake.\nIf you don’t like kiwi fruit, other vegetables and fruit high in fructans include spring onion, artichoke, shallots, leek, onion (brown, white and Spanish), beetroot, Brussels sprouts, white peaches, watermelon, honeydew melon and nectarines.\nPRUNES\nPrunes are dried plums. They contain a large amount of sorbitol, a complex carbohydrate that passes undigested into the colon where bacteria ferment it. This produces gas and water, which triggers an increase in bowel movements.\nEating prunes is even more effective than psyllium in improving stool frequency and consistency.\nOne study of adults with constipation compared eating 100 grams (about ten) prunes a day for three weeks to those who ate psyllium. The prune group passed an average of 3.5 separate bowel motions per week compared to 2.8 in the psyllium group.\nThe prune group’s stools were also softer. They rated, on average, 3.2 on the Bristol stool chart compared to 2.8 for the psyllium group, meaning their bowel motions were more toward smooth to cracked sausage-shaped motions rather than lumpy ones.\nIf you don’t like prunes, other foods that contain sorbitol include apples, pears, cherries, apricots, plums and “sugar-free” chewing gum and “sugar-free” lollies.\nWATER\nNot drinking enough water is the strongest predictor of constipation. When your body is a bit dehydrated, there’s less water for the fibre in your colon to absorb, meaning your bowel motions also become dehydrated and harder to pass.\nAim for around 1.5 to two litres of fluid per day, which can include liquids such as tea, coffee, soup, juice, and even jelly and the liquid from stewed fruit.\nPUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER\nStart by increasing the amount of water or other liquids you drink. You should be drinking enough that your urine is the colour of straw.\nNext, add in psyllium. Start with a tablespoon once a day with breakfast cereal.\nPsyllium forms a gel as soon as it comes into contact with liquids so to make psyllium more palatable, mix it with a small amount of stewed fruit or yoghurt and eat it straight away. If needed, increase psyllium to twice a day.\nAt least once a day, have some prunes (either dried or canned) or kiwi fruit and a variety of other foods high in fibre, fructans, sorbitol and fermentable carbohydrate.\nIf your bowel habits don’t improve, see your GP.\nClare Collins is a professor in Nutrition and Diabetics at the University of Newcastle, New South Wales.

      COVID-19: Supply chain remains robust, 'panic buying' situation has stabilised, says Lawrence Wong
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The panic buying situation that was seen after Singapore raised its coronavirus risk assessment level last week has stabilised, although some outlets may not be fully stocked yet due to manpower and logistics issues, said Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong.\nEven so, Singapore\'s supply chain remains robust and the major retailers should resume ""normal stock levels in a day or two"", he said at a press conference\xa0on Wednesday (Feb 12).\nDuring the surge in demand, retailers had to move stock very quickly from the warehouse into their stores, he said.\nMany of them activated extra people to stock shelves and contracted additional logistics companies to support their operations, Mr Wong added.\nMany people had to work overtime as well in order to make sure shelves were restocked, said Mr Wong, as he thanked those involved for stepping up their response.\n\nLast week, Singapore raised the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange after clusters of the coronavirus surfaced locally.\xa0\nThis prompted a ""wave of panic buying"", said Mr Wong. Stores in Singapore saw a\xa0sudden surge in demand for groceries, leaving some shops temporarily out of stock.\xa0\nBut the fact that Singapore was able to meet that sudden demand proves that its diversification strategy is able to protect the system from any sudden shocks, Mr Wong said.\n\n""So we just want to continue to assure Singaporeans that our supply chains, when it comes to food and grocery items, remain robust. Our diversification strategy ensures that we are protected from any sudden shocks,"" he said.\n""We were able to meet that demand. It was simply a matter of getting the supplies out from the warehouse into the retail outlets, and the supply chain that we have remain robust,"" he added.\nPANIC ""SPREADS FASTER"" ON SOCIAL MEDIA THAN THE TRUTH\nAuthorities can understand why people were concerned and anxious, said the minister, but the response from the public last week demonstrates the challenges in conveying ""accurate information"" to the\xa0public in such situations.\n""When we went around asking, there was some misunderstanding, or even a lack of clarity around what was going on, what DORSCON Orange meant, despite our best efforts at explaining to all of you,"" he told reporters.\xa0\n""We briefed editors beforehand, but you know, in times like this, it just goes to show how challenging it is to get accurate information out,"" he said.\xa0\n""In today\'s world of social media, fear, uncertainty and panic spreads a lot faster on social media than the truth, which is boring and nobody wants to share.""\nThe authorities will ""double down"" on efforts to ""continue to push out information in a timely manner"".\n""We are doing daily briefings now to the media. We hope all of you will help us too, to get the information across,"" he told reporters.\nThe Government will disseminate any information it has that is ""relevant and useful"", said the minister.\nHowever, if it is something it does not know about or is unable to make an accurate assessment of, ""we will have to be honest and we will tell you that we do not know,"" he added.\nHe gave the example of people asking how the novel coronavirus situation will unfold in the coming days and weeks.\n""The honest answer is – it is still too early to tell,"" said Mr Wong. ""We really can\'t say whether it will get better, whether it will get worse, what sort of situation is going to unfold.""\nAs Singapore steps up its surveillance and does more testing of cases, the country can expect to see more cases coming up ""in the coming days and weeks"", he said.\nDON\'T SPECULATE ABOUT WHETHER DORSCON WILL CHANGE COLOUR\nThe minister also spoke about the DORSCON framework, saying that people should not speculate about when the colour-coded framework will change.\n""Let\'s not get into this thing about speculating, anticipating, worrying whether it\'s going to turn from Orange to Red, which I think to some extent happened when it went from Yellow to Orange, and then it created that sense of panic and concern,"" he said.\nThe focus instead should be on the measures put in place, because each colour can contain a range of measures.\n""We are in Orange, and within Orange we can put in place a whole range of measures that are more than what we have today,"" he said.\nSingapore authorities\xa0on Wednesday confirmed three new cases of the novel coronavirus, taking the total number of people who have tested positive in Singapore to 50. Eight of them are in critical condition.\nSix more patients have been discharged, the authorities said on Wednesday, meaning that 15 people have fully recovered.\nDownload our app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the COVID-19\xa0outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram\n', 'related_topics': ['     Wuhan virus ', '     Lawrence Wong ', '     food ']}"

      Once a mecca for factory outlets, Indonesia's Bandung now courts Instagram travellers
  </h1>, 'text': 'BANDUNG, West Java: The two-storey clothing store sat on a busy road\xa0in central Bandung city.\xa0\nDespite the general bustle in the area, things were quiet in the shop, with more store clerks than shoppers.\nThe establishment next door fared no better despite touting a massive year-end discount, with\xa0polo shirts going for as low as 25,000 rupiah (US$1.7) each.\nThere were cars in\xa0the parking lots, but visitors headed straight for the food vendors and stalls surrounding the main buildings, instead of the factory outlets located within.\nMs Restianti, 41, a manager at a Bandung factory outlet called The Secret, said it has been this way for the last four years.\nThe manager, who like many Indonesians go with one name, said the store used to welcome 4,000 visitors on weekends and 1,000 on weekdays.\xa0\n“Tourists used to come in droves and the parking lots used to host buses instead of cars.”\xa0\nToday, the figure is a quarter of what it was, forcing Ms Restianti to cut back on the number of employees\xa0from 100 to 50.\nAnd The Secret is not alone. One by one, factory outlets in Bandung - once an important draw for visitors - have closed their\xa0doors.\xa0Taking their place are\xa0cafes,\xa0restaurants and other attractions\xa0that cater to Instagram travellers.\nAccording to the Bandung Trade and Industry Agency, the number of companies operating factory outlets in Bandung fell from 98 in 2009 to 40 today.\n“There used to be 30 or 40 factory outlets just on this one road. Now you can count them with two hands,” Ms Restianti said of the once-famous Riau Street.\nRight now, The Secret is still operating at a profit. But Ms Restianti is afraid that the situation will continue to deteriorate and her store will have no choice but to shut down.\n\n\nMeanwhile, the adjacent Dago Street, once considered the epicentre of Bandung’s factory outlet scene, is now almost completely devoid of clothing shops.\nA CITY IN TRANSFORMATION\nThe dwindling number of factory outlets in Bandung serves as yet another example of the retail scene going downhill. In a\xa0worldwide phenomenon some have dubbed\xa0the “retail apocalypse”,\xa0brick-and-mortar stores are finding it difficult to compete with online platforms.\nFrom the ashes of the factory outlets, a bustling culinary scene has emerged.\nIn 2014, Bandung had\xa0291 restaurants and cafes. By the end of last year, this\xa0figure had more than doubled to 795. This is separate from more than 70,000 street vendors and small food stalls operating in the city.\nAll across Bandung, there are streets and backroads which are completely overrun with cafes, bistros and restaurants. One example is\xa0Progo Road, which has completely transformed from an upscale residential area to a trendy culinary hotspot frequented by the city’s youths.\nMeanwhile on Braga Street, run-down art deco buildings that used to house businesses and offices have been turned into hip cafes, restaurants\xa0and bars.\xa0\nAnd virtually all of the eateries have one thing in common: they are instagrammable.\n\n\nMdm Kenny Dewi Kaniasari, chief of the Bandung Tourism Agency said with the decline in number of tourists looking to shop at factory outlets, the city is developing its culinary scene.\n“We are trying to diversify our tourist attractions and right now food seems to be what tourists are after. We are encouraging people to be as creative as possible and turn their properties into a destination for tourists,” she\xa0told CNA.\nAround 7 million\xa0tourists visit Bandung every year, and 60\xa0to 70 per cent of them are\xa0millennials.\xa0\n""They (millennials) need wi-fi, somewhere to charge their phones, a place to hang out and socialise and they need to take selfies. That’s why businesses, particularly restaurants and cafes in Bandung, are creating a space that can cater to all their needs,"" she added.\nSo far, this seems to be creating a real impact.\nOn Braga Street, eateries with the most customers were the ones that offer themed interiors, intricate details and decorated walls to serve as backdrops.\nThe government has also played a part in making Bandung more instagrammable.\nSince\xa0the administration of former mayor Ridwan Kamil - now the governor of West Java - the city has been developing more instagrammable public spaces.\nThe government has also built an elevated park on a sky bridge running along\xa0Cihampelas Street, a busy commercial centre frequented by tourists. The park has many spots for selfies and features smartphone charging stations.\nFACTORY OUTLET BUSINESSES DIVERSIFYING\nWhile this is happening, those in the factory outlet business\xa0are also diversifying.\n“When I started my first factory outlet in 1995, I knew that one day people will stop coming. And when people changed the way they shop with the arrival of online shopping, I knew that the death of Bandung’s factory outlets is at our doorsteps,” businessman Perry Tristianto\xa0told CNA.\nMr Tristianto, who was once dubbed as “the King of Bandung’s factory outlets”, now only operates three stores. He used to operate\xa027 of them during the retail heydays.\nHis company has since branched out to other areas, operating three amusement parks in Bandung’s hilly suburbs of Lembang as well as owning several hotels and restaurants in the Greater Bandung area.\n“As a businessman, you have to know where the market is going and adapt. Otherwise, you won’t survive,” he said.\nAnd all of Mr Tristianto’s amusement parks are designed for the social media age.\nOne theme park, The Farmhouse, is made to resemble European towns. Visitors can rent\xa0traditional European costumes to fool their friends into thinking that they were in another continent.\nHis most recent venture is The Great Asia Africa theme park which features a miniature Japanese temple, artificial cherry blossom trees as well as its own version of the Fushimi Inari Shrine’s torii gates of Kyoto.\nThe theme park also has a replica of the Taj Mahal and its own take on the huts used by African tribesmen complete with\xa0a man-made\xa0savannah.\nOver at the hilly suburbs of Punclut, restaurants are offering an unobstructed view of the city along with selfie spots. There is a pavement filled with suspended umbrellas, arches made out of roses and outdoor spaces lit by Christmas lights. There are also glamping grounds for outdoor lovers.\nMARKET SATURATION?\nWith more new cafes and restaurants in Bandung, the competition is stiff.\nIn some areas, cafes can be no more than 50 to 100m away from each other. And according to cafe owner Ucok Silitonga, there can be five to 10\xa0new competitors every month.\n“When I started my coffee business in 2014, you can still count the number of cafes with your hands. Baristas knew each other. We were all part of the same community. We were friends. In the last two years or so, the scene has started to get crowded,” the 37-year-old told CNA.\nDespite the fierce competition, Mr Silitonga said the number of customers coming to his cafe, Daily Routine, is growing.\n“There are now more people looking for good, quality coffee. People are starting to appreciate what we have to offer. Tourists are starting to feel the need to check out the local coffee scene instead of going to big coffee chains,” he said.\n“The key to surviving in a saturated market is to have your own style and your own signature drinks. You need to give people a reason to come back.”\nSTREET FOOD HAS A ROLE TOO\nWhat about the thousands of small vendors and food stall owners selling food on pavements next to an open sewer or those operating on dilapidated and dimly lit shops?\nMdm Kaniasari said the tourism agency is working with other government departments\xa0to make sure they are not left behind.\n“We need to educate these vendors that tourists are not only looking for good products but also experience. You need cleanliness, hygiene, provide comfortable spaces for your customers and have a good and reliable service,” she said.\n“The challenge is to get these vendors to understand that they can no longer be just a food seller. They\xa0need to think of themselves as a tourism player.”\n\n\nWhat is the prognosis for Bandung\'s culinary scene?\xa0Could it go the same way as the factory outlets?\nMr Muhammad Rifky, owner of\xa0Dapur Suami Istri (Husband and Wife’s Kitchen) said that he is sanguine.\xa0\n\n\n“Growing up in Bandung, I have seen the city transforming itself from time to time. Before, people only come to Bandung to visit the hilly suburbs, then they came for the cheap jeans and clothes and now they come for the food,” he recounted.\n“The culinary scene is all the rage right now, but it doesn’t mean people stop shopping or stop visiting tourist attractions. If a new thing comes along, people still need to eat. They still need a place to hang out and socialise.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     Indonesia ', '     tourism ', '     food ']}"

      ‘Buy what you need, no need to create your own stockpile’: FairPrice Group CEO
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: NTUC FairPrice has sufficient supply of\xa0rice, noodles and toilet paper, said the head of the supermarket chain on Saturday (Feb 8), as he urged the public to buy only what they need.\xa0\n“At this point in time, we have over 9 million toilet rolls. We have about 1.2 million packs of instant noodles. We have over 4 million kilos of rice, presently. And stocks continue to come in,” said FairPrice Group CEO Seah Kian Peng.\xa0\nSupermarkets in Singapore have seen a surge in demand for groceries and personal hygiene items after the Government on Friday raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange over the global coronavirus outbreak.\nOn Saturday,\xa0the Ministry of Health confirmed seven new cases of the novel coronavirus, taking the total number of cases in Singapore to 40. Two of the new cases involved a\xa0taxi driver and a private-hire car driver.\nGlobally, the virus has killed more than 700 people and infected more than 34,000.\nFairPrice has increased the volume of its daily essentials being sent to its stores by three times, Mr Seah told reporters at one of the chain\'s distribution centres in Joo Koon. The number of delivery trips has also doubled.\nFairPrice had built up its stock in preparation for Chinese New Year as per its usual practice, and decided to continue doing so, said Mr Seah.\nFIVES TIMES THE USUAL DEMAND FOR RICE\nOn Friday, the supermarket chain saw five times the usual demand for rice, four times the usual demand for noodles and more than two-and-a-half times the usual demand for toilet paper, he said.\xa0\n“This sudden surge was one that, I would say, caught us by surprise. But I want to assure everyone out there, as you have seen at one of our three warehouses here, we do have stock available. But it does take us time to replenish the stocks, of which we are trying our best,” said Mr Seah.\nHe urged shoppers to only ""buy what you need"", saying that there\'s no need for them to ""create your own little stockpile at home"".\n""Because when you do that and everyone’s trying to get it on the same day and at the same time buying more things, you just add strain to the system.”\xa0\nMs Toh Hui Leng, FairPrice\'s chief supply chain officer said its distribution centre at 1 Joo Koon Circle can hold more than 52,000 pallets of dry goods. It is currently at about 70 per cent capacity, up from the usual 60 to 65 per cent.\xa0\nAnother dry distribution centre that FairPrice has in Joo Koon can hold about 28,000 pallets of goods. It also has a fresh distribution centre in Upper Thomson that can store up to 15,000 pallets of fresh food.\xa0\nAbout 53,000kg of rice was delivered by four 40 foot-long container trucks to the distribution centre at 1 Joo Koon Circle on Saturday, said Ms Toh.\nThis is roughly the high end of their usual daily delivery of about two to four container trucks worth of rice.\nPRICES TO BE KEPT ""AS AFFORDABLE AS WE CAN""\nDespite the higher demand for goods, Mr Seah stressed that prices will be kept “as stable and as affordable as we can”.\xa0\n“So far there has been no need for us to make any changes,” said Mr Seah, adding that suppliers have not increased their prices.\xa0\n“So far so good. We hope things don’t change. But we have had very good working relationships with all our suppliers.”\xa0\nFairPrice has imposed a S$50 limit on the amount of vegetables each shopper can buy.\nWhen asked if FairPrice would set a ceiling for the number of products per customer, Mr Seah acknowledged that there have been calls from customers to do so.\xa0\n“If we really do introduce any of this, it’s really to make sure (that customers) pace (their) buying, because there are stocks. If we do introduce limits it is not because we don’t have stocks,” he said.\xa0\n“By and large the buying has been quite calm. But at the same time, we also don’t want overbuying. So this S$50 (limit) is something that we have asked our staff to look out for and tell customers. I think with S$50 you can buy a lot of vegetables.”\nCALLS FOR CALM\nDairy Farm Group, which runs Giant and Cold Storage supermarkets in Singapore, said it will not be placing purchase limits on products.\xa0\n“Like other food retailers we have seen a spike in demand for fresh produce along with household cleaning and hygiene products,” Mr Chris\xa0Bush, CEO of Southeast Asia Food at Dairy Farm Group, said in response to queries from CNA.\xa0\n“We would like to assure our customers we are working hard to swiftly restock our stores in addition to working closely with our partners for continued supply. We ask for calm as we have a stable supply with no need to purchase in bulk.”\nPrime Supermarket said it has prepared ahead and has ""more than sufficient supplies to restock all shelves"".\xa0\nAside from rice and instant noodles, items such as bread, milk, biscuits, vegetables, eggs, fish and meat have also seen an increase in sales by 20 to 50 per cent, said a Prime Supermarket spokesperson.\xa0\n""Our staff have\xa0been monitoring and restocking every shelf\xa0since the rush buy started.\xa0Our warehouse is well-stocked (with) daily necessities items and we will monitor closely on stock level.

      The ultimate Kobe beef journey: On the road in Japan with Tokyo’s Wagyumafia
  </h1>, 'text': 'All roads lead to Rome, but all wagyu roads lead to Kobe. And if wagyu is Champagne, then Kobe is Dom Perignon, believes the Vice Governor of Hyogo Prefecture, home to the famously expensive, exclusive and sought-after Tajima wagyu beef, more commonly known as Kobe.\nAs statements of intent about arguably the world\'s finest beef go, the aforementioned couldn’t be clearer.\nWe’re in Kobe at the start of a week with Wagyumafia – the world\'s coolest Kobe purveyors loved by celebrities like David Beckham, Ed Sheeran and many more – that will reveal so much about the incredible marbled and effortlessly melting beef. Wagyumafia currently have four restaurants in Tokyo, one in Hong Kong, an imminent opening in Manila and plans for more around the world.\nFirst, a quick reminder on what makes it so special. “Wa-gyu” simply translates as Japanese cow, the most common breed of which is the Japanese Black which has three bloodlines – Tajima, Kedaka and Shimana.\nHowever, only pure Tajima, bred, raised and slaughtered in Hyogo Prefecture, can be certified as Kobe beef. Only around 4,000 cattle a year make this grade, the vast majority of which are for domestic consumption, hence the global scarcity – and correspondingly high price.\nHisato Hamada, the charismatic chef and founder of Wagyumafia, famed for his photo poses, was joined by five stellar chefs from around the world for the weeklong Kobe Beef Summit: Richie Lin from Mume in Taipei, Paul Carmichael from Momofuku Seiobo in Sydney, Jordy Navarra from Manila\'s Toyo Eatery, Richard Ekkebus from Hong Kong\'s Amber and finally Tomos Parry from Brat in London.\nIn the mountains two hours north of Kobe, we started with incredibly rare access to the 101st Kobe beef auction. Buyers and farmers crammed into a compact amphitheatre space to bid up to US$90,000 (S$122,000) for just one cow. As they did so, auctioneers in orange robes called out the prices, before farmers who hand raised the cattle then provided thank you gifts of flowers or sake to the buyers.\nThe auction and surrounding pens were spotlessly clean, without the usual farmyard smells – and also very quiet. Why? Seemingly because they\'re so relaxed and happy, leading lives where they\'re very well looked after, rarely more than 150 to 200 animals on any one farm.\nHerds are so small partly due to the lack of grazing space, meaning they invariably grow up in barns, something which helps them develop their famously marbled flesh. Kobe wagyu is up to 25 percent marbled fat, a stunning figure compared to USDA Prime which runs around 8 percent.\nAnd sorry to disappoint, but those myths about being fed beer, given massages and played classical music? All bull, as it were, at least according to one of the farmers we spoke to:\n""I have 150 cows – if I massaged them I wouldn\'t have time to do anything else!""\nAnother buyer at the auction was Wagyumafia\'s Hamada, snapping up the second most expensive cow for US$65,000. In total, he buys around 100 full-grown Kobe cattle each year for his growing restaurant empire, one we were to see in full flow.\nThe most Instagram-friendly way that Wagyumafia serve it is in their famous “sando” sandwiches, the Chateaubriand version of which can run a cool US$180. Hamada\'s trademark sando pose has also become Instagram gold in itself. A recently-opened Yakinikumafia spot lets you grill your own, while you can also #slurplikeaboss – their words – with some of the world\'s most expensive and decadent beef noodle soup.\n\n\nA post shared by HISATO HAMADA (@wagyumafia)\nThe final night of the Summit bought a very special menu of dishes crafted by the five chefs featuring Kobe. Richard Ekkebus chose the 147-day aged striploin, serving it with seaweed, kabocha and steak sauce.\xa0\nTomos Parry, famed for his grill restaurant in London\'s East End, cooked skewers over binchotan charcoal, serving them with a vibrant take on salsa verde, all while trying to catch updates from his beloved Wales during the Rugby world cup.\xa0\nThe most striking dish was the “jewel box”, an aptly-named explosion of decadence where rice provided the base for Kobe, uni, caviar, the finest tuna and much more besides.\nHamada was clearly delighted to have spent a week with his fellow chefs and could not have been prouder to see them cooking his beloved Kobe: “It\'s been my dream to showcase our beef to the world. When I started exploring this industry it was very old-fashioned – not in a bad way – but it was difficult to change things. It\'s interesting to see how we\'ve changed and evolved to now showcase this beautiful wagyu through the dishes of these five incredible chefs.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     Japan ', '     food ', '     Travel ', '     Fine dining ']}"

      10 restaurants to head to for abundant Lunar New Year family feasting
  </h1>, 'text': 'This year, the Lunar New Year comes just in time to challenge that New Year’s resolution to lose weight or eat more sensibly.\nIf you’re dining at a Chinese restaurant this month, odds are the regular menu is off limits and you’ll have to order from a special and extravagant Lunar New Year menu.\nWe did the hard work of over-indulging between the Gregorian and Chinese new years to bring you a diverse list of Lunar New Year dining options, from classic Peranakan and Teochew, to an American riff on yusheng and noodles.\n\n\nADRIFT BY DAVID MYERS\nIt may be a modern Californian restaurant, but Adrift by David Myers has gotten into the spirit of Chinese New Year with a five-course omakase dinner priced at S$198 for two.\nNaturally, the meal begins with a platter of yusheng before segueing into decadent delights like a whole grilled dover sole, abalone with pickled lemon and lardo, and a unique suckling pig with cucumber and bitter leaf bao.\nIf you’d rather graze from the a la carte menu, you can still order the yusheng platter at S$15 per person, with a minimum party of two. Available from January 24 to 27.\nCANDLENUT\nThe regular Ah-ma-kase menus (starting from S$88 per person) at this Michelin-starred Peranakan restaurant are hearty enough to rival any special Chinese New Year set menu.\nThe lunch menu alone features five main courses, a soup, three appetisers and dessert. So fans of the elegant Nonya food here need only order an additional Lo Hei Platter (S$68, feeds about four to six people) to evoke that inimitable festive feeling.\nCandlenut’s version is chock full of homely favourites like shredded iceberg lettuce, carrots, dried orange peel and ginger strips. It’s also given a Southeast Asian spin with a plum sauce dressing spiked with gula Melaka and ginger flower. The Lo Hei platter is available from January 23 until February 8 and must be ordered a day in advance.\nCHUI HUAY LIM TEOCHEW CUISINE\nTeochew classics are the order of the Lunar New Year at this dependably excellent restaurant.\nSituated within the clan building of the same name, Chui Huay Lim has a bevy of Reunion Sets starting from S$328 (available only on January 24), of which the highlights are the Teochew Prosperity yusheng and five-spice roasted suckling pig. From now until February 9 (except on January 24), Celebration Sets starting from S$248 present the likes of braised fish maw soup with conpoy and crabmeat, and baked live Boston lobsters with fermented bean and garlic.\nFAT CHAP\nThe six-course Chinese New Year menu (S$48 per person, minimum four to dine) at this casual eatery hopes to channel feel-good family vibes.\nThe crispy Taro-Taro yusheng is bright with citrus-cured salmon, while savoury snacks like hae bee hiam (spicy dried prawn floss) on sesame crackers and Bang Bang Sichuan pickled cucumbers make for fun starters.\nWarm your spirits with a double-boiled Fortune Chicken Soup before digging into a balsamic-braised pork belly and Thai-style fried golden snapper. There’s also Treasure in a Lotus Leaf, in which fragrant Hokkaido rice is cooked with XO Chinese sausage and crispy ebi (small prawns). Available from now until February 8.\nGRAND SHANGHAI \nRecently refurbished to evoke 1930s’ Shanghainese opulence, this stalwart restaurant ushers in the Year of the Rat with lavish Shanghainese specialities.\nThere are the likes of a dramatically presented crispy smoked duck infused with osmanthus tea; yusheng with Australian lobster and three-head abalone; and a six-head abalone Fortune Pot heaving with sea cucumber, prawns and pork knuckle. These come as part of festive sets that range from S$588 to S$2,888 for groups of four to 10 respectively, available from January 17 until February 9.\nKIN\nFor chef Damian D’Silva, Chinese New Year was always about spending time with his late Peranakan grandmother, watching her whip up a welcoming feast for a hungry crowd.\nHis Five Blessings menu at Kin, then, is an ode to her and his favourite dishes that graced their family’s festive table. These include a tangy garam assam snapper (S$34); hati babi bungkus (S$30), a rare delicacy comprising spiced minced pork and liver wrapped in caul fat; buah keluak babi tulang (S$46), pork ribs braised in a mildly spicy gravy with the ambrosial Indonesian black nut; and udang masak nanas (S$48), where fresh prawns are cooked in a piquant pineapple soup.\xa0 \xa0\nMADAM FAN \nA fabulous spot for indulging in a bit of Art Deco glamour, complete with chanteuse belting out vintage-style reworks of jazz, swing, pop and doo-wop hits from a dimly lit stage.\nSet menus are available for a minimum of two (S$138 per person), so you can come for a special treat with your paramour or clan and enjoy an Abundant Eight Treasures yusheng that lives up to its name with lobster, geoduck, sea urchin, abalone, scallop, salmon and ikura, all topped with gold flakes. Also part of the set are braised six-head truffle abalone, charcoal-grilled wagyu, and braised kind prawn cheese vermicelli. Available until February 8.\nMIMI AT THE RIVERHOUSE\nThis swish modern Chinese restaurant is serving three festive menus that start from S$68 per person. Each features the Prosperity Akagai Yusheng (from S$48) laden with delicious things like Akagai ark clams, deep-fried yam, pickled red ginger and crispy salmon skin tossed in a truffle and yuzu dressing.\nAmong the ambrosial selection are Mimi’s Signature Flaming chicken, which is flambeed in rose wine; braised abalone with mushrooms; and truffle fried rice with scallops.

      The kaiseki chef who uses the same spring water as Kyoto’s Imperial Palace
  </h1>, 'text': 'When he turned 36, chef Yoshiro Kiyama opened Kiyama on the first floor of a condo in the upscale residential area of Marutamachi, just a five-minute walk from Kyoto’s Imperial Palace.\nKiyama, one of Japan’s rising culinary stars, had trained for 15 years at Wakuden, a Kyoto institution known for putting out culinary talents. Ten of those years were spent as head chef.\nJust one year after its opening in 2017, Kiyama was bestowed a Michelin star, becoming Kyoto’s most talked about kaiseki restaurant by gourmands across the country.\n“This space used to be a law firm. When I first saw it, my heart told me that I needed to have my restaurant here. I felt it was fate that led me to this location,” said Kiyama on how he found the perfect premises.\nAs one enters, one instantly feels a sense of calm thanks to the restaurant’s minimalist, wood-based aesthetic, which shifts the focus to the dining experience. There is a nine-seater counter and two private rooms that resemble classic tea houses. Here, one’s mind slows to a crawl, giving one time and space to enjoy a two-hour kaiseki meal.\n\n\nLocated south of the imperial grounds’ Sakaimachi Gate, Kiyama found out that the restaurant is built above the same stream source as the water used by the Imperial Palace. To draw water for his restaurant’s use, he built a well connected to the stream that gives him exclusive access.\nKyoto’s natural groundwater, Kiyama explained, is very soft and contains lower levels of calcium and magnesium, making it ideal to cook broths and create simple yet compelling dishes. “Having soft water means you can make good kelp dashi, but bonito works well too. Dashi made from bonito flakes has much richer flavours and a deeper taste,” he said.\nA dining experience here\xa0features a degustation menu of dishes infused with different aromatic broths. The culinary journey ends with a comforting cup of matcha.\nTo invite diners to experience the entire process with him, Kiyama begins by making the broth in front of them. First, his apprentice skilfully slices hard blocks of bonito into beautifully thin flakes until they fill up a large bowl. This is a rare sight as most restaurants use ready-made bonito flakes. The flakes are then tossed into a kombu kelp stock which has been brewing for two days. When the taste is just right, Kiyama strains the mixture through a sieve and uses that as the base for the soup.\nBecause Kaiseki is often considered the most refined of Japanese cuisines, where the presentation and arrangement of each ingredient is just as important as the taste, Kiyama pays special attention to the tableware. Many of these are antiques from China’s Ming Dynasty and Japan’s Edo Period, carefully chosen to match the colour and composition of each dish.\nKiyama’s set menu changes according to what’s available in the season. This is good news for those who enjoy variety, as the courses change throughout the year. “What we care most about is that we want our guests to keep coming back. When the ingredients change, the menu changes. I use what’s best in that specific season and month, and what best fits our dashi,” he said.\nAdapted from the series Remarkable Living.

      100-year-old oven the secret to famous banana cake in JB bakery
  </h1>, 'text': ""JOHOR BAHRU: At noon every day, the scent of freshly baked confectionery wafting\xa0out from a quaint bakery\xa0fills\xa0a\xa0street in downtown Johor Bahru.\xa0\nCustomers eager to taste the first batch of banana cakes of the day have already formed a snaking queue outside the shop, indulging in the sweet, fruity aroma.\xa0\nInside Hiap Joo Bakery & Biscuit Factory, amidst what feels like organised chaos, trays upon trays of cake pans\xa0emerge from a huge hole in the wall -\xa0the bakery’s traditional wood-fired oven.\xa0\nStill warm, the cakes are sliced and packed into clamshell plastic containers.\nThese tender, speckled cakes with caramel brown crust is the reason for the line of people in front of Hiap Joo.\nAn addition to the\xa0century-old bakery in 2003, this very cake\xa0saved the business from a looming bankruptcy and\xa0made\xa0Hiap Joo famous among the sweet-toothed Malaysians and Singaporeans.\nOLD IS GOLD: HIAP JOO’S WOOD-FIRED OVEN\xa0\nMr Lim Meng Chin, the bakery’s owner, said that\xa0Hiap Joo’s success can be\xa0attributed to its oven and the shop has no intention of switching to a “more modern” appliance with temperature control dials and timers.\n“We have kept it as it is since the old days, not changed. Of course the oven makes the difference, everything we cook in it tastes better.\n“Even when we cook rice or water in the oven, the aroma is different, the taste is different,” added Mr Lim, 67.\xa0\nVisitors impressed with the rustic charm of the oven would take pictures and upload them on social media, contributing to the bakery's popularity over the last decade.\xa0\n“People are all fascinated by the oven. The bakery is quite small and compact but they will still try to take a picture of the oven and pose with it.\n“Some of the customers don’t believe that I would use such a traditional oven. I encourage them to take pictures of it,” said Mr Lim, who is also a tai chi\xa0master.\xa0\xa0\nHiap Joo, with its built-in oven, started operations in 1919. It was opened by an Englishman, who sold it to the Lim family in 1930. Mr Lim’s father was one of eight family members who owned and operated the bakery.\nHowever, during the Japanese Occupation in World War II, the family members gave up the bakery in fear of being killed, and ran to hide in the jungle.\nThe bakery and oven were left untouched until after the war when the family returned and resumed operations.\xa0\nMr Lim’s father obtained sole ownership of the bakery in\xa01960, and ran the business\xa0until his death in 2003.\n\n\nTHE BAKERY'S\xa0TURNING POINT\nFrom its founding until 2003, the bakery sold only French loaves and sandwich loaves. Its best-seller had yet to exist.\nBut after his father’s death, Mr Lim and his son, Lim\xa0Toh Shian, held a discussion on how to generate a higher profit margin for the bakery.\xa0\nIt was a watershed moment for Hiap Joo as the bakery had been on a downward spiral and was heading towards bankruptcy.\xa0\nBut Toh Shian, 40, had an idea to bake banana cakes and buns with filling such as coconut, red bean, kaya, ikan bilis, otah and potato curry.\xa0\nThe idea proved to be fruitful as Hiap Joo’s popularity rose. Scores of customers, from as far as Singapore and\xa0Kuala Lumpur, would brave long queues to buy packs of the banana\xa0cakes.\n“It was a turning point for Hiap Joo,” said Toh Shian.\xa0\n“For the first five years or so, we worked really hard — me, my father and my two uncles. We worked long hours to get the batter (for the banana cake) right. Soon, we managed to turn a huge profit.”\xa0\nDue to its popularity,\xa0they bake the banana cakes non-stop\xa0from 11am till 5pm each day.\xa0\xa0\nTo preserve the quality, Mr Lim is particular on the recipe, the ingredients and even\xa0the materials.\xa0He insists on a specific type of banana - berangan - which has a slightly dry and starchy texture.\nThe wood he uses for the oven is from a rubber or bakau tree.\xa0\nThe prices of these logs have increased over the years, but he found the right supplier from Peninsular Malaysia to ensure the Hiap Joo banana cake brand is preserved.\xa0\n“If we use a different kind of baking pan, the cake wouldn’t rise nicely. It just didn’t work,” said Mr Lim.\xa0\nAlthough he insisted on using the same oven, he has relented to Toh Shian’s request to use a modern food processor, so that the bakery can whip\xa0eggs, banana and flour in 15 minutes, instead of the manual way\xa0which could take up to an hour.\xa0\nToh Shian, who started working at Hiap Joo at 18 after he finished secondary school, explained that it is important to find the balance between coarsely and finely mashed mixture.\xa0\n“The banana needs to be slightly chunky, which gives the bread its moist, gooey texture,” said Toh Shian.\xa0\n“We want a little pulp to make the cake lighter, fluffier,” he added.\n\n\nNO PLANS TO EXPAND FOR NOW\nFollowing the bakery’s success over the last 17 years, will\xa0Hiap Joo consider to expand its business, or even open one outlet in Singapore where it has a large fan base?\xa0\n“We thought about it but that would mean moving away from our traditional baker style of operation, using a wood-fired oven for our cakes and buns,” said Toh Shian.\xa0\n“But we decided against it because we don’t want to compromise on our quality,” he added.\xa0\nMr Lim concurred, adding that an expansion could eventually hurt Hiap Joo’s brand in the long run.\xa0\n“The economy is uncertain and many bakeries in Malaysia have closed down recently,” said Mr Lim. “We don’t want to risk making our cakes taste different. Consistency is most important.”\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Malaysia ', '     Johor ', '     food ']}"

      Crickets, algae, soya discard — 3 foods of the future, made in Singapore
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Pasta, cookies and wine are comfort food to some Singaporeans. But what if the pasta and cookies are made of crickets, and the wine actually made from tofu “waste water”? Would that be hard to swallow?\nAt a time when tastes are changing, with global trends such as the rise in plant-based meat substitutes, some local food start-ups are looking to come up with breakthroughs like these.\nThey are part of a new food technology wave about to sweep against climate change and food insecurity as the world population and global food demand shoots up.\nEven plant-based meat is no better than chicken in terms of carbon footprint, producing about five times the emissions of legumes and vegetables, scientists have said.\nThe newer alternatives, including foods processed in laboratories, are on the horizon and not just a distant dream, the programme Why It Matters finds. But how receptive would people be? And taste aside, how healthy is such a diet? (Watch the episode here.)\nINSECT BITES OF A DIFFERENT SORT\nRaavee Shanker, for one, wants to change mindsets about insects as a food source. He co-founded Asia Insect Farm Solutions, which has cricket farm tie-ups across Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand, after finding that insects were better than plant-based options.\n“I can claim that (insects) are more nutrient-dense than any other plant- or animal-based product,” he said.\n“Plant-based options have to go through very extensive processing in terms of isolating the protein so that it’s high enough for us to consume and fulfil our nutritious needs.”\nCrickets are his insect of choice because they multiply quickly, are more likely to be toxin-free and are already consumed in some parts of the world.\nFarming crickets is also kinder to the environment. Their greenhouse gas emissions average 1 gramme per kilogramme of weight gain, compared with 2,850 g for cattle, 1,300 g for pigs and 300 g for chickens.\n“(Crickets) are very efficient in converting the feed they eat into body and muscle mass. For example, 2 kg of feed … contributes to 1 kg of body mass,” Raavee said, adding that water sources are not needed in their enclosures.\n“All the water they need is obtained from their feed diet. In terms of land space, about 1 square metre is able to produce about 10 kg of crickets.”\nOnce they have reached a certain size, that’s when his start-up powderises them into a flour of sorts.\n“We pack them in the freezer for them to go into a state of deep sleep, and then once they’re ready … we put them through a heating process (which) dehydrates them. At the same time, it kills any bacteria,” he explained. “We then put them through a grinding process.”\nThe result is a flour-like texture, which he said is “naturally much more nutritious” than beef, with about twice as much protein per 100g and all the essential amino acids.\n“Humans need about 20 amino acids in general. But nine of them can’t be produced naturally by our body. Crickets deliver all nine that we need,” he cited.\nThe idea is to create a versatile product that could work well with any flour-based recipe. And so that consumers do not “detect a very distinct difference in flavour”, his company had to get the cricket feed and processing right.\nStill, there may be a yuck factor in most people’s minds, he acknowledged. “So we’re going to focus on creating tasty food products that people can get on board with,” he said.\nBecause we want consumers to get a higher level of nutrition, but at the same time, enjoy the taste they’re familiar with.\nAs far as Ethan Nava is concerned, he could not tell that the cricket-based pasta and cookies he had on the show was anything unconventional.\n“Crickets aren’t so bad. If it were cockroaches, I’d feel like it may be a different story, whereas crickets are just in the grass, hopping around,” he said.\nWATCH: Your pasta will be made from crickets: Future foods (4:00)\nLIKE GRIME ON FISH TANKS\nAnother organic material that can be added to flour-based ingredients is microalgae. It is considered plant protein, and the man who created Singapore’s first microalgae food thinks that growing such an alternative protein source here is “quite logical”.\n“Because we can’t rely on imported legumes or plants,” said Ricky Lin, the founder of Life3 Biotech.\nThe government is on a “30 by 30” drive — to have 30 per cent of Singapore’s nutritional needs produced locally by 2030, up from less than 10 per cent.\nTo this end, Lin’s firm is using equipment called bioreactors to grow and harvest microalgae, single-cell organisms that live in water. The controlled conditions induce photosynthesis, prompting the cells to split and multiply.\nCompared with agricultural crops, microalgae production requires only a tenth of the space. They can grow up to 20 times faster. And a little could go a long way at the dining table.\n“If we’re able to formulate food using maybe 30 per cent of microalgae (dried into a powder) as a raw ingredient, then … about 30 g is good enough for a portion (size),” Lin reckoned.\nHe acknowledged that “the grime you see in your fish tank” comes to mind when thinking about food made from microalgae. But he added that humans have been eating algal products for a “few thousand years”.\nHe compared seaweeds, which are macroalgae, to their micro-organic cousins. “At the cellular level, (living things) are pretty much the same. We eat animals caught in the wild, for example fish. And the fish feed on this microorganism,” he said.\n“So why don’t we go directly to the food chain itself at the base level?”\nAs for the taste test, Why It Matters host Joshua Lim tried microalgal noodles, and they reminded him of noodles with soya bean paste or even green tea soba. “Very tasty noodles,” he said in between mouthfuls. “Very light.”\nTOFU TIPPLE\nSingapore’s reliance on imported food could be reduced also if food waste is turned into desirable food, considering that 640,000 tonnes were thrown away in 2018. And that is what makes the brainchild of Chua Jian Yong special.\nThe PhD student at the National University of Singapore has created an alcoholic beverage whose base ingredient comes from soya bean. It tastes somewhat like white wine but is made from a liquid whey that is otherwise discarded.\nThe production of tofu generates two by-products: Okara, the soya bean pulp; and the whey. Both are commonly thrown away by tofu manufacturers, but Chua has been taking the whey and converting it into what he calls Sachi.\n“Soy whey itself contains nutrients. So if you dispose of soy whey into the drainage without processing, it can result in water pollution in the long run,” he said.\nSo rather than spend energy and resources to process the whey, “why not convert this by-product into a consumer beverage”, he figured.\nSugar and fruit acid, which is commonly found in beverages, are added to the whey and mixed well before the fermentation process starts. They provide nutrients and an optimum condition for yeast to grow as part of the alcohol production.\nAfter fermentation, the yeast is centrifuged out, leaving behind a clear beverage. “The alcohol (content) for this drink is about 7 per cent, which is similar to moscato,” added Chua, the chief technology officer of NUS spin-off SinFooTech.\nLim enjoyed the Sachi “maybe a bit too much”, while it also fared well among the bar patrons he approached to give it a go. And it is sold in a nice-looking bottle, he noted.\nBIG MONEY\nAny novel food product to be launched in Singapore must first go through an approval process, so that should allay any consumer concern about “having Frankenstein food being fed to us”, said food scientist Christiani Jeyakumar Henry.\nBut there is still the question of the effects of the latest sustainable foods on human health in the long run. There is lack of research evidence, he pointed out — even though products like cricket flour can be tested.\nThe professor’s tests, for example, found that the flour was made of 49 per cent protein and 19 per cent fat, whereas wheat flour has about 11 per cent protein and 2 per cent fat.\nWhile the product’s nutritional content was “pretty impressive”, he pointed out that “it’s a bit of an oxymoron” to call it cricket “flour”, because “in our vocabulary, flour normally comes from a cereal”.\n“The point made was that cricket has got more protein than a beef steak, and I think that’s true,” said the director of the Clinical Nutrition Research Centre under the Agency for Science, Technology and Research.\nWhen it comes to “regular and prolonged consumption”, however, there is no “hard and fast data on … the long-term consequence”. But his prediction for the future is that these food technologies will be “unstoppable”.\n“In 20 years’ time, we’ll need to look at alternative sources of protein to match what we currently have,” he said. “(And) there’s an incredible amount of venture capital coming into food technology.”\nAgri-food start-up companies raised about US$17 billion (S$23 billion) globally in 2018, up by 43 per cent from 2017 and by up to sixfold since 2012.\n“These are exciting times, incredible times — no parallel in human history. But at the same time, we’re trying to ask the question: What are they health benefits? If they’re good, bravo!” said Henry.\n“If you’re a venture capitalist, you want — in the long term — to be a surviving capitalist. And to do that, you have to tell the consumer what’s the added value … I’m arguing that it’s nutrition that will win the day.”\nWatch this season finale of Why It Matters here.\n', 'related_topics': ['     food ', '     CNA Insider ']}"

Located in a quaint nondescript traditional house of white stone walls and grey Kawara-tiled roofing, the zen-like architecture is matched by the warm, relaxing atmosphere inside.\nAt the heart of this 16-seater eatery is owner and chef, Yukihiko Tsuchisaka, who stands behind the bar counter creating elegant tempura courses and beautifully-plated kaiseki sets. Tsuchisaka designs his menu with seasonal ingredients and decides what to serve based on what is available at the market that day.\n“Japanese cuisine has a harmonic flow and allows us to feel the seasons. I structured my menu with both – the softness of Japanese cuisine and the power of tempura,” said Tsuchisaka.\nAccording to him, the secret to perfect tempura is not just in the batter (which must be adjusted to suit different ingredients), but the temperature of the oil and timing in which the ingredients are fried.\n“If you are a tempura chef, you should be able to detect the temperature of oil when you stand in front of oil. I do not use a thermometer but I sense the temperature with my body,” he revealed.\nWhile the cooking looks simple enough, the chemical reaction taking place is actually quite complex. By frying the ingredients in a batter, the ingredients lose moisture, but this heightens the umami and fragrance. However, if cooked too long, the ingredients lose umami and the texture becomes dry.\nAchieving that fine balance of precision timing and perfect temperature to bring out the right amount of moisture, umami and fragrance is why Tsuchisaka maintains a consistent two-star rating, year on year.\n“I fry the food in front of the guests and serve it right away. When they eat, the flavour of the oil, the flavour of the ingredients and its umami will harmonise in the mouth.”\nThe other reason he prefers to cook in front of his patrons is to put on a show and give them a fully immersive dining experience.\n“I want all the guests in this restaurant to pay attention to me. The counter is like a stage. I want them to see how I cook and experience my performance,” he enthused.\nThe true essence in tempura boils down to the ingredients that Tsuchisaka uses. One of his favourite fishes to cook is pond smelt.\n“I am from Shiga prefecture and there’s a lake called Biwa. In the winter, we catch pond smelt which is a tasty fish. When I make tempura with pond smelt, it’s fried as if it is swimming in the air. I think this is very unique,” he said.\nTsuchisaka’s road to success was not without its own set of difficulties. As a teen, he worked for a fishmonger and developed a vast knowledge of seafood. During that time, he met a sushi chef who impressed him with his knife skills, and that was when Tsuchisaka heard his calling to become a chef. However, his father was worried that his son would fail and disapproved of his ambitions.\nLuckily, Tsuchisaka’s mother supported his dreams and encouraged him to enrol at Tsuji Culinary Institute in Osaka after finishing high school. “When I left home, my father told me that if you go now, do not ever come back to this house. He threw away my rice bowl, chopsticks and futon. When I look back now, I can say I did not give up and survived my training period. It was because of what he did to me. I have to admit that I really appreciate my father,” he confessed.\nTsuchisaka opened Shunsaiten Tsuchiya 12 years ago and despite its popularity, he doesn’t have plans to open another restaurant. “My principle is not to expand my business but rather, keep it compact and with good service. I want our guests to love this restaurant, and in order to do that, I want to improve my skills to better serve the guests,” he concluded.\nAdapted from the series Remarkable Living.

      This Michelin-starred Bangkok restaurant is aiming for a zero carbon footprint
  </h1>, 'text': 'Few Michelin-starred restaurants boast eco-credentials as impressive as that of Bo.lan’s. The charming 85-seater restaurant, located off the beaten track in Bangkok, serves native Thai cuisine made with wholly sustainable organic produce.\nIt was started by husband and wife team, Thailand-born Duangporn Songvisava (nicknamed Bo), and Australian-born Dylan Jones. The name Bo.lan is derived from the combined names of Bo and Dylan.\nThe couple met while they were honing their skills in the steamy kitchens of David Thompson’s erstwhile London outpost, Nahm. They married seven years later and decided to start Bo.lan and serve authentic Thai food “as it should be,” without any dumbing down of flavours to cater to Western preferences.\nTheir menu has the full force of the country’s fiery and complex flavour profiles. It has since become one of the most respected fine dining restaurants in Bangkok, and Songvisava was voted Asia’s Best Female Chef in 2013 by Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants guide.\nApart from growing their own vegetables and herbs in a keyhole garden behind the restaurant, the pair has adopted multiple green practices in their aim to achieve a nearly zero-carbon footprint.\n“We used to use bottled water like most other restaurants in Thailand, which meant that we would have this pile of plastic bottles at the back of the restaurant every night. One of the first things we did to eliminate plastic waste was to introduce a water filtration system that could process drinkable water,” shared Jones.\nThe next step was to find a way to recycle waste through composting in their garden, built with recycled glass bottles. “Our policy is no food should go into landfills. Our kitchen uses the vegetables and herbs that we grow in our garden, and at the centre of the garden itself, is the compost. So, we’re feeding the garden the whole time with our kitchen waste,” he added. To boost the pollination process, the couple even introduced native stingless bees into their garden.\nDeeply committed in seeking the best sustainable practices, the couple would travel throughout Thailand to meet artisanal food communities, farmers, fishermen, artisanal producers and craftsmen. Their fervent efforts in sourcing for sustainable, fresh and non-GMO produce has ignited a movement within the network of chef and community producers.\n“In the first year they started, Bo and Dylan went in search of local suppliers with good quality food, then they started introducing them to other restaurants and chefs. With their pioneering efforts, an entire community of chefs and local producers was formed,” explained Kay Khun, founder of Food for Change & Biothai Foundation.\nBesides advocating support for local producers, Songvisava and Jones also conduct public awareness programmes to touch on the importance of supporting local. Songvisava shared that the good quality of ingredients and diversity of food resources will disappear if nothing is done to protect them. She upholds that the food business should be sustainable, environmentally-conscious, season-centric, and hyperlocal.\nAt Bo.lan, environmental sustainability goes hand in hand with preserving Thai food heritage. For example, all their spices, such as the curry paste, are still pounded with a mortar and pestle. “We relish and champion a lot of traditional cooking methods. We think it is important to maintain tradition and pass them on to the next generation,” enthused Songvisava.\nInstead of having dishes served course-by-course in a typical Western restaurant, Songvisava feels that it is important to serve everything together as an authentic Thai dining experience should be. “This is how Thai people eat, how the royal families eat and how the peasants eat. We enjoy communal dining,” she quipped.\nA wide range of local flowers and citrus fruits is used in their menu, which is a great testament to the biodiversity of the local produce available in Thailand. “In a way, we are also trying to motivate locals to value our own history, culinary wisdom, ingredients and produce,” she attested.\nAfter seven years of being partners in life and in the kitchen, Songvisava and Jones continue to innovate.\n“Our ultimate goal is really to push our limits in terms of what we’re capable of doing. We are planning to scale down with an off-grid 10-seater restaurant on a plot of land where we would grow our own produce, generate our own electricity and recycle our own waste and water, while still working closely with local food communities. We also hope to keep things fresh by opening only four months in a year,” Jones revealed.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Restaurants ', '     Bangkok ', '     Thailand ', '     food ', '     gastronomy ']}"

      Phuket’s best eats, from tom yum talay to barbecue-glazed snapper
  </h1>, 'text': ""When French fine dining bible Michelin launched its coverage of Phuket and its neighbouring province Phang Nga in 2019, it came as little surprise to in-the-know foodies. While the so-called Pearl of the Andaman is best known for its dazzling white-sand beaches, luxury resorts and lively nightlife, it's culinary scene is up there with the best in Thailand.\nLike Penang, its equally gastronomy-fixated near neighbour just over the border in Malaysia, the island has been a melting pot of cultures for centuries. Traders from Europe, China, and the Middle East have all left their imprint, while the island’s majority Muslim population has been augmented by migrants from other parts of Thailand (mainly the country's north-east) who have brought their own food culture with them.\nThrow into the mix a lively international dining culture catering to expatriates and, of course, tourists, and you have the ingredients for a pretty tasty recipe indeed. While the island has numerous international dining highlights such as the Michelin-starred Pru at the Trisara resort, it is strongest when it comes to its unique indigenous food: A glorious mash-up that incorporates Malay, Thai and Chinese influences. Here’s a quick primer on the best places for a quality spread on the paradise island.\nBAMPOT\nThe entrance of Michelin to Phuket has no doubt sparked a rush by some restaurant proprietors and chefs to burnish their concepts and read up on multi-course tasting menus. But in some ways, the well-established Bampot is a shining example of how to do solid upscale dining in a casual and approachable way without the often-extraneous bells and whistles.\nStarted by Scottish chef Jamie Wakeford, the restaurant quickly became known as a place that combined advanced cooking skills with an overall boisterous conviviality. Wakeford has moved on to pastures new to start Olta, a critically garlanded venture in Bangkok, but his legacy is being guarded skilfully by current resident chef Freddy Warne, from England.\nThe rustic-luxe seasonal menu may feature such offerings as barbecue-glazed snapper with black quinoa and charred chili, or ribeye carpaccio with shimeji mushroom and wasabi, but comfort food like a Scotch quail egg with mustard mayo and a TFC (Thai fried cauliflower), along with the dimly lit bistro’s craft cocktail menu ensures every meal's a relaxed delight.\nfacebook.com/Bampot.co\nPAK NAM SEAFOOD\nThere's a better-than-even chance that you'll hear Pak Nam Seafood before you see it. Tucked away in an obscure area on the outskirts of Phuket Town – the island's charismatic capital – the restaurant is very much a local favourite.\nIndeed, the rambunctious chatter from the clientele is as much of a giveaway that you have arrived as the venue’s signage, which is often obscured by the trees that surround the venue. As anyone who has ever been to a Thai seafood restaurant will know, aesthetics is a much lower priority than the essentials of dishing out quality cuisine.\nAs such, the tartan-print tablecloths, plastic chairs, and sometimes inefficient service are compensated for by some of the best seafood on the island. There's nothing sophisticated about the experience here. Standard Thai beers and local spirits dominate the drinks list while portion options come in but two sizes: Large and small.\nNevertheless, there’s some serious skill at play in the kitchen. A gaeng poo (Phuket style crab curry cooked with coconut milk and chili) is revelatory, while other morsels worth savouring include squid with salted egg and a righteously fiery tom yam talay (hot, sour seafood soup).\nRatsada, Mueang Phuket District, Phuket 83000, tel: +6676 240 240\nPRU\nDutch chef Jim Ophorst brings locavore inclinations to a delicious crescendo at Pru: The only Michelin-starred restaurant on Phuket. Located at the sumptuous Trisara resort on the island’s north-western tip, the venue is the antithesis of your average hotel restaurant.\nOn the cusp of his thirties, Ophorst is hardly a seasoned veteran. Nevertheless, an extended stint alongside Asia's top-rated chef Anand Gaggan at the latter's now-defunct eponymous Bangkok restaurant has earned him some formidable stripes.\nIndeed, the questing spirit embodied in Thailand by Gaggan is present and correct at Pru where Thai ingredients are shaped into bewitching gourmet creations that draw inspiration from both east and west. The venue's name – an acronym for Plant. Raise. Understand. – provides a solid clue as to its overriding philosophy.\nIngredients are 100 per cent sourced from within Thailand, with much of the organic produce grown at Trisara's 16,000 sqm farm. There's a strong emphasis on the terroir of the Andaman Sea, which laps at the coastline a matter of yards from the restaurant, with dishes such as coral grouper and cauliflower and black crab with local coffee exemplifying Ophorst's determination to make the most out of what’s in his backyard.\nprurestaurant.com\nRAYA\nNo restaurant on Phuket pays homage to the island’s rich culinary history more than Raya. A long-standing fixture in Phuket Town, the venue is beloved of everyone from families headed by wizened old aunties and uncles to aspiring Thai influencers and A-list glitterati from around Asia.\nThe setting certainly has something to do with the restaurant’s enduring popularity. Housed in a restored 130-year Sino-Thai mansion, the rickety venue exudes ramshackle charm. Vintage Asian art livens up the walls while the antiques dotted around the place and the display cabinets filled with dusty china add to the feeling of dining in a living museum.\nThis overall feeling of heritage lovingly preserved and passed down to a younger generation is conveyed – most importantly – in the Phuket-style Thai dishes on the menu. Pretty much everything is good, but diners seeking an authentic flavour of the island should not miss stone-cold classics like moo hong (slow-braised pork belly with pepper and garlic) and gaeng poo (crab coconut curry served with rice vermicelli).\n48/1 Dibuk Rd, Tambon Talat Yai, Mueang Phuket District, Phuket 83000, tel: +66 76 218 155\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Phuket ', '     Thailand ', '     food ', '     gastronomy ', '     Travel ', '     Restaurants ']}"

      Mala madness, Insta-friendly eats: 10 Singapore food trends that shaped the 2010s
  </h1>, 'text': 'The food world is a fickle world, especially in a food-saturated island like Singapore. One minute we can’t get enough of Japanese cheese tarts and character cafes, and the next thing we know, those same super-popular establishments\xa0bade us a woeful goodbye.\xa0\nBut in the grand scheme of things, we did really well when it came to food in the 2010s. It was the decade in which game-changing industries were built and designed so that we eat better. Well, unicorn food and freaky milkshakes, notwithstanding.\nNo doubt, Instagram dominated much of the cultural world, which in the realm of food, translated to a decade of avocado toast. In many ways, the image of avocado slices artfully fanned out on a slice of rustic bread became the emblem of today’s Instagram generation of foodies, which in turn meant…\nTHE DEATH OF TRADITIONAL FOOD MEDIA\nSocial media became the platform people turned to when deciding where to eat. Why read a 500-word restaurant review in a newspaper or website when a beautiful picture could spin the proverbial thousand words on the likes of blogs and, yes, Instagram? Well, one might reason that good grammar and real knowledge about food would be a draw, but the likes don’t lie, which leads us to…\nTHE RISE OF PICTURE-PERFECT FOOD\nAs if there wasn’t enough pressure on chefs to make their food to stand out in Singapore’s saturated dining scene, it is now imperative that their food photographs well too. While this upped the ante at fine restaurants across the island, it also spawned weird and wonderful creations like unicorn bagels at the Geylang Serai Hari Raya Bazaar, acai bowls (which are really fruit smoothies in a bowl topped with fruit), and “flying noodles” suspended on a pair of levitating chopsticks. Suffice it to say, not everything tastes as good as it looks, so we say bring back the good old ugly schlop like scissors curry rice, please!\nBUT WE ATE HEALTHIER AS A RESULT\nThe upside of Insta-friendly food is the realisation that healthy food can be immensely photogenic. Exhibit A: The ubiquitous grain bowl. Gorgeous, layered and colourful, grain bowls emerged as the modern-day answer to the one-bowl lunch (sorry, mee pok tah). This coincided with the growing popularity of more conscious, healthy eating where we eschewed pork lard for grilled chicken breast and chilli-lashed noodles for trendy low-carb grains like quinoa, barley and cauliflower rice (yes, we know cauliflower is not a grain).\nWE EMBRACED PLANT-BASED MEALS \nThe healthier we ate, the more we were won over by the idea of a plant-based diet. More of us are convinced of its benefits to our health and planet. It helps that today’s vegan offerings are a far cry from the suspiciously pink slices of phoney bacon and gummy gluten char siew. Sometime during the decade, someone baked kale chips, which made the leafy green great again, while others gave us oat milk, plantain yoghurt and beets dusted in dukkah. We’ve never loved eating our veggies more.\nWE ATE IMPOSSIBLE ‘MEATS’\nPlant-based eating spawned plant-based meats like the Impossible Burger and Omnipork that taste so much like the real thing. As hard-core carnivores, we adore the idea that we can go to a burger restaurant or fancy Chinese establishment and order a hearty plant-based burger or Omnipork dumpling without missing the meat. Meatless Mondays have never been easier.\nWE DEVELOPED URBAN-FARM-TO-TABLE FOOD\nAt the start of the decade, urban farming became a buzzword thanks to intrepid folks like Edible Garden City, Comcrop and Onhand Agrarian, who began making farms out of rooftops, balconies and fish ponds across the island. In doing so, they opened the doors for Singapore’s urban farming culture, showing the country that we can grow and sustain our own food sources. Today, urban farming is an important part of our food scene, giving us affordable, excellent-quality fresh produce both at home and at restaurants, and a means to lower our carbon footprints through our food choices.\xa0\nWE NETFLIX-AND-CHILLED THANKS TO FOOD DELIVERY SERVICES\nRemember the early days of food delivery services, when there was a 50-50 chance of your order getting delivered? Thanks to the likes of Grab and Deliveroo, food delivery pioneers like Food Panda upped their game and we can now sit back and concentrate on watching Black Mirror while their trusty riders bring our favourite mala fry-up straight to our doors.\nBOY, DO WE LOVE MALA\nSeven years ago, our love for steamboat gave way to our even greater love for mala hot pot. We stand in line for hours at our favourite restaurants for no other reason than to torture our taste buds with the tongue-numbing spice and deal with our tender tummies the morning after. We love mala so much that mala xiang guo stalls began mushrooming all over Singapore, from food courts to hawker centres and in the basements of malls. Today there are mala-flavoured potato chips, chicken wings, instant noodles and even mala Spam. The salted egg yolk craze had nothing on it.\nWE PAY TO EAT AT OTHER PEOPLE’S HOMES\nIt’s not enough that we have restaurants, cafes and a hawker stalls around every street corner, now we’re paying to eat at people’s homes. The past three years have seen a rapid burgeoning of private dining venues where seasoned cooks open their homes and kitchens to strangers. The cooks – who include young professional chefs, a retired chartered accountant, a cultural medallion winner, and this food shameless food writer – serve the likes of complex Peranakan fare, old-school Cantonese favourites, and artisanal hand-crafted pizzas and pastas. Reservations are notoriously difficult to snag, with waiting lists that can stretch for up to a year. Evidently, we’re as hungry for good food as we are for novel exclusivity.\nWE’RE DRINKING MORE MOCKTAILS (WE DIDN’T SEE ONE THAT COMING)\nTime was when the only pairing you could order with your degustation meal was wine. These days, a non-alcoholic drink pairing is par for the course at most fine restaurants. And at cocktail bars, you could belly up to the mixologist and ask for a drink made with zero-proof spirits like Seedlip (botanical distillations), Whissin (alcohol-free whiskey) and Herbie Virgin (non-alcoholic gin). Teetotallers have never felt this cool – and if that’s not an achievement for the decades, we don’t know what is.\n', 'related_topics': ['     dining ', '     food ']}"

      The man helping to make Southern Thai food the nation’s hottest cuisine
  </h1>, 'text': ""He may have spent his university years in Boston and much of his working career in Bangkok, but Supaksorn “Ice” Jongsiri can’t stop talking about Southern Thailand.\nPerhaps that’s no surprise. Jongsiri, who hails from the province of Nakhon Si Thammarat, is the proprietor and creative force behind Sorn – one of the hottest tables in the Thai capital – and a trailblazer in bringing the fiery flavours of the southern kitchen to a global audience.\n“I can’t say that we are truly local because we are operating in Bangkok, which is in central Thailand,” he laughed.\n“But you won’t find us cooking pad Thai, green curry or anything like that here. All of us – from the kitchen staff to the front of house team – are from the south. We travel around the south seeking out new ingredients and producers and our food comes from the heart.”\nSince debuting in 2018, Sorn’s meteoric rise to prominence has been nothing short of a sensation.\nIt snagged a Michelin star within months of opening – becoming the first Southern Thai speciality venue in the world to gain such recognition.\nFrom the very beginning, the 20-seat venue has been fully booked (and they are fully booked until Feb 29, 2020). And inspectors from the French gourmet bible did nothing to shorten the months-long waiting list for a table by awarding the restaurant a second star at Thailand’s most recent Michelin unveiling in November 2019.\nGiven all the hype surrounding him and his baby, it would be easy for Jongsiri to adopt a frigid, detached demeanour befitting of his nickname. The chef, though, is as engaged and evangelical as ever – especially when it comes to the food of southern Thailand.\n“This village is known for its sand mole crabs,” he said, pointing excitedly at a speck on the giant map of the country's southern provinces that hangs on the wall of the downstairs reception room at Sorn.\n“We source our squid from here,” he continued, moving his finger north up the Kra Isthmus, the narrowest part of the Malay Peninsula, to another unidentified coastal settlement.\nThe map, and the obvious glee that Jongsiri derives from uncovering culinary loot from all over southern Thailand, brings to mind a swashbuckling adventurer seeking out hidden treasures.\nThe analogy is apt given the region’s strong seafaring heritage borne of its long coastlines on both the Andaman Sea and the Gulf of Thailand.\nIt also reflects a bold and often robust approach to spicing and flavouring and its centuries-old trading links with Europe, India, China, Arabia and its proximity to Malaysia – all vital factors in the slew of cultural influences that have seeped into its food.\nDespite its popularity, Southern Thai cuisine has tended to be seen as the piratical wild card in Thailand’s culinary arsenal.\nLess refined than Central Thai food, significantly spicier than the herbal inflected cuisine of the north and with a far greater diversity of foreign influences than the largely homogenous Lao/Isaan traditions of the country’s northeast, the food of the south has revelled in its status as a rowdy outlier.\nYet while there are few Thais who haven’t enjoyed pitting their taste receptor cells against a piquant gaeng som (a yellow-hued sour curry known for the ferocity of its spicing) or a pad sataw goong (stink beans stir-fried with prawns and shrimp paste), the cuisine has only recently reached the sunny uplands of widespread acclaim.\nThere are now numerous places to sample Southern Thai food in Bangkok, with upscale stalwarts including the excellent Khua Kling Pak Sod, which has numerous branches in the capital. Other standouts include Janhom, where the auntie-proprietor is known for her aggressive spicing, and Prai Raya, a long-standing fixture from Phuket which recently opened a branch in the big smoke.\nGlobal Thai restaurant operator Mango Tree, meanwhile, recently brought a group of international chefs to Southern Thailand to learn more about the cuisine in advance of rolling out a special Southern Thai menu at its 70 outlets worldwide.\nWhile the self-effacing Jongsiri would demur at taking too much credit for the popularisation of the cuisine, there is little doubt that his efforts have helped spread the word in Bangkok and to the wider world.\nBefore Sorn, he was the driving force behind Baan Ice, a homely restaurant specialising in southern dishes where his grandmother headed up the kitchen for a long stint.\nSorn – a collaboration with fellow chef Yodkwan U-pumpruk which he funded with every financial resource he had, including, he said half-jokingly, his son’s college fund – ups the game significantly while retaining a healthy reverence for bold flavours and traditional techniques.\nIndeed, there’s little sign of compromise at the restaurant. Menus change according to seasonality, while all ingredients are sourced from the south whenever possible (around 90 per cent, according to Jongsiri).\nGuests are eased into the experience courtesy of a series of dishes where modern fine-dining techniques are applied to southern ingredients.\nSample bites might include a slice of raw seven-colour lobster from Phuket topped with a dab of spicy, tangy seafood sauce; or nuggets of Satun crab coated in southern yellow curry and plastered with their creamy roe.\nWith these niceties dispensed with, Jongsiri and co get down to heftier business with a selection of family-style sharing dishes that typically includes a gaeng som made with young mangosteen, a gaeng tai pla (curry flavoured with fermented fish innards) and gaeng leung (stink beans stir-fried with squid filled with their eggs).\nIt's all punchy, powerful stuff. And it's a testament to the talent of the chefs that they have managed to make Michelin-worthy cuisine out of what might be considered by fainter hearts as aggressive ingredients. Jongsiri, for his part, is thrilled that an uncompromising approach has allowed him to come so far, so fast.\n“I didn’t think about the restaurant in a calculating way,” he said. “If I had I might have toned down the flavours and done 100-covers. “Sorn was just something I felt I had to do. The dishes are not what we think other people might like to eat. It’s what we like to eat.”\n"", 'related_topics': ['     food ', '     gastronomy ', '     Thailand ', '     Chefs ', '     Restaurants ', '     Profiles ']}"

      The low-income women who are baking in change into their lives, together
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: A fantastic smell wafts through the air the moment the door opens. Inside, four women are kneading and shaping dough with their hands. They are making pineapple tarts.\nIt is a simple scene in a humble place in Whampoa. But the lives of the women here have been far from simple.\nSingle mother Azizah Mohd Noor has four children, and the youngest is hyperactive with borderline intellectual functioning. Home is usually not a place of rest for her.\n“But here, I feel peaceful, happy with the situation,” said the 48-year-old, referring to the training space at the HDB block in Whampoa Drive. “It’s like we’re free to do what we want here.”\nIt is also where the women are like family to each other.\nEveryone calls Rusnah Sajee “Mak Rus”, not only because the 59-year-old is the oldest among them, but also because they consider her to be their substitute mother.\nWhen Yashmin Abdullah received a marriage proposal, the Filipina sought Rusnah’s advice about remarrying. “I always thank Mak Rus, who told me this man is good,” said the 45-year-old, who got married last year.\nMostly, however, the elder woman dishes out advice about baking, such as to make dough by hand instead of using an electric mixer.\n“You can feel the texture and (whether) it’s equal in every part. If you use the mixer, the strength of the mixer might be too hard on the dough, and it won’t turn out well,” she said.\nBaking is what brought them together, and has benefited them all. These women from rental neighbourhoods are able to earn money from festive bake sales and corporate social responsibility projects, as part of a programme called Bakers Beyond.\nNow in its sixth year, it is poised to reach out to more women — and perhaps provide a second home for them, just as its current bakers have done so for themselves.\nAZIZAH’S STORY\nIn Azizah’s case, it was in 2015 when she joined Bakers Beyond, after she got to know Beyond Social Services, the charity behind the initiative. “I loved to bake, but I didn’t know how,” she said. “I just baked anyhow.”\nThat soon changed as she learned new skills in the volunteer-run programme. She also found emotional respite from her domestic turmoil.\nHer divorce had drained her. And when her ex-husband remarried, he did not allow her to see her elder daughter for two years, even though they had joint custody.\n“(When) I saw other families and their children, I felt sad because I needed my daughter,” she recalled.\nNot only was she feeling down, she was in financial difficulties. Her mother had fallen sick, so she had quit her job as a food packer in a catering company to become a full-time carer.\nShe could only work part-time as a cleaner, which meant not having enough money for her children. “I couldn’t afford to take them out — to eat outside or watch movies,” she recounts.\nThat was the first thing she rectified when she began to earn money with Bakers Beyond. If there are orders for, say, 100 hampers during Chinese New Year, Hari Raya or Deepavali, she can earn around S$600 to S$700.\n“Sometimes I (take my children) to Johor Baru,” she said. “Of this money, I can (also) save some.”\nAt the same time, when she wants to get away from the messiness of home life, Bakers Beyond is her escape, where she has friends to turn to for advice and more.\nFor example, Rusnah has advised her — to good effect — to be patient with her nine-year-old with special needs.\nAnd when her mother died, the group stepped in to help “with everything”, from the preparation to the clearing up. Yashmin even cooked food to serve the mourners after the burial.\n“They said I didn’t need to come up with a single cent. I was really touched,” said a teary-eyed Azizah.\nON THE MOVE AT FIRST\nBakers Beyond has given women like her a home from home. When the programme first started, however, they did not have a place to call their own, as they had to move from kitchen to kitchen.\nWATCH: The bakery that changes lives (3:45)\nThey sometimes operated in social enterprise Samsui Kitchen and in the Agape Village, a social service hub in Toa Payoh, depending on the availability of the spaces.\nSometimes that meant baking in Samsui Kitchen from 10am to 2pm, then packing up and rushing to the Agape Village to continue baking from 3pm to 7pm.\nSometimes they also had to train in Beyond Social Services’ main office in Jalan Klinik, where the baking space was small.\nHaving to move around was something Yashmin could relate to in her life, as she was once homeless. She came here in 2008 after marrying a Singaporean. But when he started divorce proceedings in 2014, he kicked her out.\nShe took their two children with her and lived in a homeless shelter for nine months and in interim housing for another nine months.\nThere was added uncertainty because with a divorce happening, her long-term visit pass was revoked, which meant she could not get a job. And she had to go to the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority monthly to renew her visitor’s pass.\n“The feeling was very hard,” she said. “But when I saw my children at the time, I said I needed to face this problem for (them).”\nEventually, her Family Service Centre found her a rental flat and she started working part-time after getting custody of her children.\nA friend she had made at the shelter also introduced her to Beyond Social Services. Although she had “zero knowledge” of baking, she gave Bakers Beyond a try, and the programme, in turn, gave her “peace”, “laughter” and new friends.\n“(With) them, I can talk a lot, (sharing) my problems,” said the usually soft-spoken lady. “They’re very good people.”\nBAKING, SEWING AND BEYOND\nWhen it came to baking, the women taught her patiently. Her first task was simply to ensure that cookies in the oven did not burn. Today, she is a whizz at making the gingerbread man, her favourite.\nThe women learn on the job from each other, from volunteers and from facilitators brought in to teach them, say, a royal icing recipe and, in one instance, a pineapple tart recipe brought back from Hong Kong.\nThey get baking orders through Beyond Social Services, but they handle the business-related matters, for example creating a system of remuneration for the different roles the team members play.\n“They have greater ownership of the projects (than before),” said Stella Jayanthi, a team leader at Beyond Social Services.\n“Six years ago, I was doing a lot of running around, deciding, budgeting and all that. Now I’m participating only 20 per cent of the time.”\nThey also get to keep all the proceeds, but they contribute a “love offering” of about S$60 a day to the charity for using utilities and the baking space.\nThat was the amount they were charged before the Bakers Beyond training space was officially opened last month with the help of sponsors such as Mapletree Investments, Cargill TSF Asia and the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore.\nThe space used to be Beyond Social Services’ storeroom. After renovation, it now comes complete with convection ovens, electric cake mixers and other commercial equipment.\n“The women had a dream,” said T Ranganayaki, the charity’s deputy executive director. “They wanted a space of their own, where they can share their success with other women.’\nThere are now eight to 10 women in the programme, with the youngest aged 40. But she hopes the training space will be where more in the community can learn not only baking, but also skills like sewing.\n“These are the kinds of things we’re looking (to do) next year,” Jayanthi added, “(for) any woman who’s in low-income housing, who’s interested to learn skills … as long as you’re willing to travel here (and) participate in the training.”\nBusiness training is also on the cards, which is something Azizah is especially interested in, as her dream is to open her own shop.\n“Thank God many people — volunteers — have helped us and taught us in this training centre. So far, I can see that I’ll go further,” she said.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Community ', '     food ', '     CNA Insider ']}"

      Indonesia faces backlash over baby lobster export ban
  </h1>, 'text': 'JAKARTA: A proposal by Indonesia\'s new fisheries minister to remove a cap on exporting baby lobsters has come under fire, with critics saying it could deplete stocks around the archipelago and boost the fishing industry in competitor countries.\nFisheries minister Edhy Prabowo, who was appointed by President Joko Widodo in October, has said reopening exports of lobster larvae, known as seeds, would help support livelihoods.\nPrabowo argued that an existing export ban encouraged smuggling and Indonesians could sell seeds to Vietnam, where lobster farming is more developed, media reported.\nFormer fisheries minister Susi Pudjiastuti, who is popular for blowing up 556 foreign boats caught illegally fishing, implemented the ban on catching and exporting lobster smaller than 8cm in length, or 200g\xa0in weight, in 2016, to conserve the population.\nPudjiastuti defended her policy on Tuesday in messages on Twitter, including a video of herself on the beach of the lobster producing town of Trenggalek, in East Java province, talking about the importance of not overexploiting the crustacean.\n""If we don\'t care and we don\'t stop the catching of our lobster seeds, we will only enrich Vietnam and Indonesia will never see any more lobsters in our ocean,"" she said, sitting cross-legged on the beach.\nThe issue has prompted intervention by President Joko Widodo after going viral on social media with hashtags on Twitter such as #lindungilobsterkita (protect our lobsters) trending.\nWidodo said a review of the ban should not only consider the environmental aspects, but also economic ones.\n""Don\'t only say no (to exports). A balance is needed, but also, it shouldn\'t be that everything is caught all over the place for exports. That would be wrong too,"" he said.\nIndonesia is a major seafood exporter, but lobster shipments have slumped in recent years to about 1,960 tonnes from 3,330 tonnes in 2016, according to German database company Statista.\nThe Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia found that undersized lobsters continued to be sold in Indonesia despite the 2016 ban, due to poor law enforcement, and suggested in a report in August more research was needed to help grow the industry and restock the population.\nMarking another possible policy change from his predecessor, Prabowo has floated the suggestion that some seized vessels could be handed over to fishermen or authorities rather than destroyed, according to state agency Antara.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Indonesia ', '     food ']}"

      Foodies, here’s why you should add this gourmet festival to your calendar
  </h1>, 'text': ""Escape to Amazing was the\xa0carrot that Lexus dangled. This journalist quickly dismissed it as hyperbole, to be honest. After all, the word itself inspires an expectation of the phenomenal – in astonishing proportions. And is, therefore, a rather dangerous covenant to bind oneself to.\nAnd so I sat in suspended anticipation in a Lexus NX300 en route to Margaret River for the annual Western Australia Gourmet Escape, the Japanese carmaker being an official sponsor for the second consecutive year.\nThe food and wine festival, touted as one of the world’s best, is held each year in the picturesque Margaret River wine region, three hours south of Perth.\n\n\nThe charming destination has grown renowned for its undulating vineyards (217 at last count) and wineries, as well as its scenic coastal trails, ancient multi-chambered caves and world-famous surf breaks.\n“It’s a beautiful corner of the earth,” Marco Pierre White told CNA Luxury as we chatted in the Lexus hospitality tent in the Gourmet Village festival grounds sited on Leeuwin Estate.\n\n\n“It’s quite magnificent in the sense that half of it is sort of wild and the other half is manicured; it’s a visual feast to the eye, really,” the Michelin-decorated British celebrity chef continued.\nWhite was among the constellation of culinary stars including the likes of Dublin-born chef/restaurateur Colin Fassnidge (My Kitchen Rules) and Mark Best (Masterchef Australia) who came to cook, inspire and fraternise at 45 finely curated epicurean events in addition to the cooking workshops and bevy of local cellar door tastings on tap, all spread over 10 decadent days.\nAnd unlike most leading food festivals of the world that are concentrated in one location such as Taste of London in Hyde Park and The Good Food & Wine Show (Melbourne,\xa0Sydney,\xa0Perth, Brisbane), Gourmet Escape offers a smorgasbord of gastronomic indulgences speckled across the entire Margaret River region.\nThis 8th edition even extended to Swan Valley, also known for its wine-producing terroir, but much closer to the city – just half an hour outside Perth for those who may not wish to travel as far.\n“Gourmet Escape is, without question, the greatest food show on earth,” White proclaimed. “You’ve got the land, you’ve got the expanse, you’ve got the coast, you’ve got the vineyards, you’ve got the woodlands… the sheer number of options of all the events is amazing.”\nThere’s that word again: Amazing.\nOur four-day Escape to Amazing epicurean sojourn officially began, as it should, at Margaret River’s grand maiden, Vasse Felix, the very first vineyard and winery to be established in the region in 1967.\nOne standout dish at this first wine pairing dinner by Head Chef Brendan Pratt (formerly of The Fat Duck) was the Pork with Eel and Cabbage in La-Yu.\nAs our emcee who journeyed with us throughout our series of curated events Sarah Todd (former model and Masterchef contestant-turned-celebrity chef herself) explained, ‘Brave design’ was the culinary theme of the evening, inspired by one of Lexus’s key brand pillars.\nIndeed, it was brave of Pratt to proffer such a large amount of fat in a single dish but it was so beautifully rendered to perfection that not a single morsel was left on my plate.\nThe next course – Octopus, Burnt butter and Mushroom XO – came paired with one of Vasse Felix’s most notable varieties, Chardonnay.\n“Margaret River is considered one of the greatest Chardonnay-growing regions in the world today,” noted Virginia Willcock, Chief Winemaker and one of the most awarded female winemakers in Australia.\n“Our Chardonnay has power; it has intensity, it has a beautiful structure, it has a firm acid line but it also has a lovely dry structure,” she added.\nMuch like Willcock herself, the 2017 Heytesbury Chardonnay has a bold personality, as did the Blanc VIII that came before it.\nA WINE PARADISE BORDERING ON BORDEAUX\nWhile Margaret River is today famed for its Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon, it wasn’t Chardonnay vines that Vasse Felix’s Dr Thomas Cullity first planted but Cabernet Sauvignon, Shiraz, Malbec and Riesling.\nAs the pioneer who paved the way for Margaret River to achieve premium status on the world winemaking stage, Dr Cullity discovered – somewhat by trial and error – that the region’s Mediterranean climate (sans extreme summer and winter temperatures) provided ideal growing conditions comparable to that of Bordeaux in a dry vintage.\nHumidity levels also proved ideal, and the winning combination of climate, soil and viticulture practices continue to yield remarkable results to this day.\nDr Cullity’s first vintage in 1971 may have been a disaster owing to bunch-rot and native birds but today, his legacy continues on in the thriving wine region with 55 sq. km under vine that, while producing only three per cent of Australia’s total wine production, commands over 20 per cent of the Australian premium wine market.\nTAKUMI CRAFTSMANSHIP, EPICUREAN-STYLE \nWith craftsmanship sitting at the core of both culinary arts and that of a premium automobile manufacturer, another evening began with a creative showcase of various forms of artistic craft.\nBeatboxing champion Kairi and “calligrafitti” artist Mami were both flown in from Japan specially to perform for us, as well as the 60-something or so clients the brand was also hosting. Lexus, luxurious? Sure. But edgy? Hmm.\nDinner was yet another grand affair, conceived this time by celebrity chef Palisa Anderson, whose Thai-inspired menu was designed to likewise demonstrate the Takumi spirit of craftsmanship that goes into producing every Lexus vehicle.\nIn Japan, master craftsmen are known as Takumi and it takes about 60,000 hours of work or training (equivalent to about 30 working years) to achieve Takumi status.\nLittle did I know at this point, that I would share the stage with not just one but two true Takumis at the Gourmet Village the next day.\nI found myself in the Best Seats in the House showcase and who should walk onstage but the youngest and first British chef to be awarded three\xa0Michelin stars, Marco Pierre White, together with his mentor, the legendary Pierre Koffman. The likes of Gordon Ramsay and Jason Atherton apprenticed under Koffman, and their own proteges have since amassed more than 20 Michelin stars between them.\nAs White and Koffman conducted a cooking demonstration for the audience, I feasted on an exquisite cheese platter and sipped the finest Margaret River wine from a crystal glass.\nAmazing.\nThe writer's trip was made possible by Lexus.\xa0\n"", 'related_topics': ['     food ', '     gastronomy ', '     Travel ', '     Australia ', '     cars ', '     Fine dining ', '     Chefs ', '     Restaurants ']}"

      Supper Club: Janice Koh's favourite wanton mee, dim sum and sharing plates 
  </h1>, 'text': 'Before giving us the lowdown on her favourite supper spots, actress Janice Koh points out that she’s not “a supper person”.\n“All my supper places are around the theatres where I work or watch shows. And because I’m not a supper person, I always choose a place where there’s some alcohol. I always need a drink after the show,” she said with a laugh.\nJanice describes herself as a “functional eater”, someone who would go to a bak kut teh (pork bone soup) joint and eschew the bak kut teh. “I’ll order the sides like the white cabbage, peanuts and tau kee (soymilk skins) because I don’t really eat pork.”\nStill, she has some great after-hours food-and-drink tips, especially if you’re heading out with a group of wine-loving friends.\n\n\nEMPRESS\n“I like that Empress has a nice selection of fairly affordable New World wines by the glass. I also like that they have dim sum as part of their bar menu because I try to avoid supper, so small bites are great for me.\nWhat I especially love is that they have always some plant-based options like the Impossible gyoza because I don’t eat a lot of meat. They have indoor and outdoor seating by the river – it’s a nice, quiet place to chill after a show.”\n1 Empress Place, #01-03 Asian Civilisations Museum\nFEI FEI WAN TAN MEE\n“This is the only non-wine place on my list and it’s because my good friend Tan Kheng Hua lives in the area. She’s the only one I really go out to eat supper with. I’ve been eating [these noodles] since I was a child.\nI used to go with my extended family back when it was a back alley joint in Jalan Manggis. The table we ate on was literally a door, and we sat on stools. For me, it’s one of those [places to satisfy a midnight craving]. The chilli is the most important thing. It brings back memories of what I loved about eating there as a kid.”\n72 Joo Chiat Place\nGINETT\n“When I’m at the Drama Centre or Lasalle, I go to Ginett since it’s within walking distance. When it’s available, we order the metre-long board of cheese, cold cuts and pate that sometimes comes with a bottle of wine, which is great for a group or a hired cast of four. They also have a great range of bistro items like Burgundy snails and duck confit.”\nHotel G, 200 Middle Road\nTHE OYSTER BANK\n“The Oyster Bank opens fairly late compared to the other places in Funan, where [theatre company] Wild Rice is located. I come here because they have great deals like S$2 oysters with your drink or a bottle of Prosecco with a platter of oysters, which is great for sharing. I like to order the S$2 naked oysters and the amaebi karaage [deep-fried sweet shrimp], which was a recommendation from one of the staff there that I haven’t stopped ordering since. The spicy salmon tartar and truffle fries are always nice too. The people here are really friendly and they do a happy hour deal pre- or post-show.”\n#02-32 Funan, 107 North Bridge Road\nWINE CONNECTION TAPAS BAR & BISTRO\n“When I’m at Singapore Repertory Theatre or 72-13 [Theatreworks], my go-to spot is always Wine Connection because they have a Fat Bastard Pinot Noir, which is my favourite bottle. They have lots of well-priced wines and lots of easy-to-eat cheese and cold-cut platters, and pizzas for sharing. I usually come here when we are in a large group cast or when I’m watching a play with friends. If you book in advance, it’s a great place for an affordable supper with lots of friends.”\n11 Unity Street, #01-19/20 Robertson Walk\n', 'related_topics': ['     food ', '     Singapore ', '     Restaurants ']}"

      Meet the ‘Ironman’ of the culinary world making dining an oddly sensual experience
  </h1>, 'text': 'If one is ever in Lisbon on a gastronomic adventure, a visit to two Michelin-starred Belcanto is a must. Founded by one of Portugal’s most prolific chefs, Jose Avillez, the restaurant is renowned for celebrating traditional Portuguese flavours reinvented in ways that are both sophisticated yet playful.\nIn one of Avillez’s more recent creations, the Sea Bass with Avocado, he infuses Japanese influences using a flavourful dashi stock made of seaweed and katsuobushi, while the sea bass is presented with smoked avocado skin to look like fish scales.\n“We were the first country in the Western world to arrive in Japan in 1543, so one of our goals in Belcanto, is to revisit history and pay homage to this country, and make it part of our culture now,” explained Avillez.\nThe culinary maestro likens himself to a director – not a movie director, but a cuisine director – when designing the menus. “I think about the dishes and then we work together developing and serving [them]. All the menus are inspired by Portugal’s rich heritage, but we also look at the history of the ex-colonies and maritime discoveries of the past,” he revealed.\nFor Avillez, the key to a chef’s success is palate memory, because if you don’t have it, you have to start all over again. “If you need to try every ingredient that you’re going to combine in a dish, you don’t have time to create. But if you can put it together in your mind, then you can create as fast as you think,” he shared how he develops his award-winning dishes.\nIronically, Avillez didn’t map out a future in the culinary arts as a young man. “In Portugal, to become or to be a chef, it was something only for people who didn’t have an education. I started cooking when I was seven or eight years old, but I never thought at that time I’d become a cook. I wanted to be an architect, so I studied art, and then I ended up doing a degree in marketing and communications. Then, when I decided 20 years ago to become a chef, my mother thought I was completely crazy!” he laughed.\nAfter an internship with Ferran Andria’s El Bulli, Avillez went on to become the Executive Chef at Tavares, Lisbon’s most established restaurant. “I remember the first day I entered a professional kitchen; my heart started to go faster and faster. At that moment, I completely understood that I wanted to do this for the rest of my life,” he affirmed.\nIt was then, that he dreamt of creating contemporary Portuguese cuisine, and so, Belcanto was born. Within a year, Avillez’s unique menu and dining experience gave his leading restaurant its first Michelin star. Two years later, Belcanto received its second Michelin star.\nSince then, this culinary master has opened almost 20 restaurants in Portugal and abroad in less than a decade, which earned him the moniker, The Ironman of Portugal’s Food Scene.\nAdding to his gastronomic empire, Avillez recently opened Bairro do Avillez, his largest establishment to date, offering five dining concepts with a total seating capacity of 300. Located in Bairro village in Chiado, this former chapel (part of Trinidad Monastery) houses an artisan grocer, tapas tavern, Peruvian restaurant, seafood bistro, and cabaret brasserie.\nWhy cabaret gourmet, you ask? The idea was inspired by Avillez’s great-great-grandfather, who opened Lisbon’s first cabaret in 1908. “When we bought this place and built it up, I wanted to do something very different. I thought about doing this for fun like my great-great-grandfather, but also because I think food is also about entertaining,” he explained.\n“We like the way we put together the menu, the show, the music, dancing and the sexuality of everything, and how you transmit this sex appeal to food with creativity, with the balance of flavours, acidity and sweetness. It all about stimulating the senses.”\nAdapted from the series Remarkable Living.

      Bangkok’s dining scene in 2019: New entrants and shocking departures
  </h1>, 'text': ""Bangkok’s fine dining scene has come on like a gourmet-themed Shinkansen in recent times with thrilling new openings appearing with the regularity of an overdriven metronome.\nIt’s fair to say, though, that the last twelve months, the high-end restaurant sector in the Thai capital has witnessed a slight scaling of ambition.\nThings are still dynamic certainly, and there have been plenty of exciting new faces and developments for foodies to mull over.\nNevertheless, there’s been a perceptible slowing of the previously breakneck pace.\nThe city bid farewell to two of its toniest venues this year as Asia’s highest rated restaurant Gaggan and the acclaimed Bangkok outpost of L’Atelier de Joel Robuchon closed shop. Fans of Gaggan won’t have to wait too long for chef Gaggan Anand, the creative force behind the restaurant, to remerge though. His new independent venture in Sukhumvit is due to launch imminently.\nReduced tourist numbers and the wobbling Thai economy, meanwhile, have made footfall in restaurants all over the city less than predictable.\n“It’s been an unusually quiet year at the upper end of the Bangkok dining scene,” said Craig Sauers, managing editor of leading local listings guide BK Magazine.\n“Don’t get me wrong, there have been some fine openings. But when you compare it to 2018 when we saw the entrance of instant classics such as Saawaan and Sorn, this year feels like a momentum killer.”\n\n\nEven a sluggish Bangkok though is a hare compared to tortoises elsewhere. And with buzzy new openings – including a decadent spin on traditional Thai seafood and a neighbourhood gem championing the cause of “modern bistronomy” – the dining scene is as eclectic as it ever has been.\nTherefore, while you’d be forgiven for sensing a change of pace in Bangkok, you’d be hard-pressed to call 2019 a let-down.\xa0 \xa0\nAPPIA TRATTORIA\nIt wasn’t really broken, and it didn’t need much fixing. Even still, Bangkok’s premier Roman-style trattoria has emerged looking and tasting better than ever following a judicious round of tweaking: Both to the venue itself and to its menu.\nVisually, the restaurant has benefited from numerous subtle alterations to its interior. An expanded kitchen area gives new executive chef Miro Mattalia and his team more room to play with. A flight of stairs leads to an upstairs area where a wine cellar housing hundreds of biodynamic and natural wines takes pride of place alongside a private dining room. The introduction of bar seating, meanwhile, means that diners can pull up a pew and watch Mattalia and co work their magic.\nThe menu, too, has been given an upgrade. Although the food is still predominantly informed by the homey style of Rome’s great trattorias, the arrival of Mattalia – who hails from the city of Turin in the north of Italy – has changed things up.\nA cacio e pepe risotto, for instance, is a creamy, moreish take on the classic Roman pasta, but the extra al dente crunch tips a hat towards Mattalia’s roots in Piedmont. Mattalia has also applied his flair to dishes such as a raw ravioli made using Mazara prawns with stracciatella cheese, the artful presentation of which is more in line with fine dining than the hearty trattoria fare that Appia is better known for.\nWhile there’s certainly clearly evolution at work, Appia’s strength has always lain in its ability to keep things simple. That, thankfully, is still the case. The house-made pasta dishes sing with Italian authenticity. Also special, meanwhile, is the venue’s Porchetta – pork stuffed with fennel pollen, garlic, and rosemary, which is roasted behind the bar.\nMIA\nBangkok’s enduring commitment to sanuk – the Thai sense of fun – is alive and well at Mia, perhaps the most vivacious new restaurant in the city.\nThe idea that life should be as enjoyable as possible is the overriding concept at a venue that definitely aims its pitch at a monied party set.\nSignature cocktails at the downstairs bar get proceedings off to a lively start: Or a gloriously extended finale as the case may be.\nUpstairs, three separate dining rooms revel in their own individualist playful decor and theme, a design ploy that helped earn the restaurant immediate Instagram stardom upon debuting in the second half of the year.\nMia’s food philosophy applies a creative heft that belies its breezy persona. This weightiness is no surprise given the personnel. A collaboration between Julien Imbert, who honed his craft in Michelin-starred London restaurants, and Bangkok-based chef-duo Pongcharn ‘Top’ Russell and Michelle Goh, previously of the highly rated (but now closed) Freebird and Suhring, Mia draws on some serious talent.\nThese culinary chops are to the fore at hits such as hot smoked salmon with ikura salsa and Moroccan spiced lamb shoulder with caramelised yoghurt and rocket salad. Finish off with the signature tarte tatin, the classic apple tart with vanilla ice cream, which has become as big a social media hit as the restaurant’s eye-catching appearance.\nOLTA\nYou wouldn’t accuse Jamie Wakeford of taking the straightforward route to culinary kudos.\nThe Scot had stints in Azerbaijan and Shanghai before making his name in Phuket, where he masterminded Bampot Kitchen & Bar: A venue long-regarded as among the most creative culinary experiences on the paradise island.\nOther chefs may have taken that triumph and settled for an extended period in a hammock. Instead, Wakeford opted to swap the beach for the bustling neighbourhood of Suan Plu in Sathorn to set up his latest venture, Olta.\nWith its mood lighting, luxuriously upholstered banquettes and artfully tattooed bar staff, Olta has settled effortlessly into life in one of Bangkok’s more fashionable hoods. The stand-out factor in the venue’s success so far though is Wakeford’s imaginative, but almost doggedly unpretentious food.\nA straightforward guy, the chef eschews fine dining frills for the more egalitarian aim of providing great dishes at affordable prices.\nThat’s not to say that there has been any scrimping. Ingredients are sourced locally (whenever possible) from some of the best producers in Thailand. And this attention to detail also shines through in the dishes Wakeford puts out from his kitchen.\nHighlights include the chef’s take on a Scotch egg – made with pork belly, black pudding, quail egg, and house-made HP sauce – and more substantial plates such as wagyu beef cheek served with a blue cheese infused polenta mash.\nPAII\nThe House on Sathorn, the fine-dining flagship at the W Bangkok Hotel, started the year off with a shock farewell with the departure of head chef Fatih Tutak.\nThe exit of the Turkish chef, who had been pushing the venue in an increasingly whimsical direction, prompted fevered speculation as to what would come next.\nWould the venue continue to plot a radical course? Would the new venture be headed by another mercurial foreign talent? \xa0 \xa0\nThe answers to these questions when they eventually came with the arrival of Paii – an upscale take on a traditional Thai seafood restaurant – were a resounding no and no.\nOut went tasting plates that drew inspiration from globetrotting adventures and in came giant portions of crab fried rice and grilled river prawns.\nIn the kitchen, meanwhile, Tutak’s place was taken by Bangkok native Joe Weeraket, a more sedate presence than his predecessor.\nWhile the initial reaction to the change was a tad muted, Paii has so far proved itself a worthy occupant of the magnificent dining space in the beautifully restored historic colonial mansion.\nIndeed, anyone in thrall to the siren song of the sea will find plenty to love about what Weeraket is doing. It helps, of course, that he has access to the finest produce that money can buy. The chef, though, deserves credit for applying uncompromisingly punchy Thai spices and flavours to his outstanding raw materials.\nFried rice may sound prosaic, but it's a more impressive proposition when it swallows 500 grams of local mud crab. Epic, too, is charcoal-grilled giant river prawns served with a sweet-savoury choo chee curry sauce and French turbot baked with Thai herbs in a salt crust. \xa0 \xa0\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Bangkok ', '     Thailand ', '     gastronomy ', '     food ', '     Fine dining ', '     Restaurants ']}"

      The unlikely chef who'd like to thank Michael Jordan for his two Michelin stars
  </h1>, 'text': 'Henrique Sa Pessoa is Portugal’s first celebrity chef. He owns and runs the two-Michelin-starred restaurant Alma in Lisbon, hosts cooking shows and has also written several bestselling cookbooks.\nBut when Sa Pessoa was young, all he wanted to be was a professional basketball player. “I don’t have the conventional chef’s background where they used to cook with their grandmother and they used to pick fruits and vegetables out in the garden. That’s not me. I am a city boy and basketball was my life,” said the chef-owner of Alma.\n\n\nHis passion for basketball got him on an exchange programme to the United States.\n“I had a home economics class, and in one of those sessions was taught by a chef. I got so interested in cooking that I asked the lady in charge of the (exchange) programme if I could visit the (culinary) school,” he said.\n“From the moment I walked into the kitchen, I realised that it was love at first sight. I was really fascinated by the knife skills, the sauces, the soups. I realised that basketball was not going to be my future. In a way, I have to thank Michael Jordan, because without him, I wouldn’t be a chef,” he said.\nAfter attending culinary school in Pittsburgh, Sa Pessoa worked in London and Australia before returning to Portugal in 2002.\n“London gave me the basics of French cooking, but in Australia, that’s when I got introduced to fusion cuisine. You can get on the same plate Chinese, Japanese, French, Greek influences. Their roots are from everywhere,” he said.\nSa Pessoa was given the moniker The Fusion Chef, for the way he interprets and presents Portuguese cuisine with a global influence.\n“Two things that I’ve taken from the Asian way of cooking and thinking, are the simplicity – keep it simple, keep it fresh – and always focus on flavour. I was criticised by a lot of chefs, saying ‘oh, this is not Portuguese’. But I was trying to explain that the recipes are all Portuguese; the flavours are Portuguese. It’s just the technique that I am using, which is not Portuguese,” he said.\n“Sometimes, people forget that our coastline goes all the way up to Azores. It’s like an hour-and-a-half flight. We actually have one menu in particular at Alma that is called Coast to Coast. It’s an all-seafood menu so you come out of the experience thinking ‘okay, this is something I can have only in Portugal’.”\nTo continue innovating, Sa Pessoa created an atelier – a test kitchen to work on new recipes. He invited Perdo Loncher, former chef at Eleven, a Michelin-starred Lisbon restaurant to run the atelier as its head chef after meeting him at a cooking competition.\n“I like to challenge myself, and working alone is definitely a challenge. It’s an R&D kitchen, it really is. We both enjoy rediscovering our Portuguese gastronomy and ancient recipes. You need to have your own space to create, and come up with ideas without all the fuss and noise. I think it’s funny because Henrique calls this his ‘bat cave’,” said Loncher.\nAdapted from the series Remarkable Living.

      Why the Italian wine region of Barolo should be on your travel bucket list
  </h1>, 'text': 'As far as Italian wine regions go, it’s hard to beat Barolo. Crowds are thinner than in Chianti, the food better than in Friuli, the landscape lusher than in Umbria or Sicily. In the heart of Italy’s northwestern Piedmont region – a gastronomic paradise famous for its rich pastas and white truffles that are in season right now – this noble wine region encompasses the town of Barolo and 10 nearby municipalities.\n\n\nIn addition to producing the most venerated of Italian wines – the robust, age-worthy Barolo – the region is also a delight to visit, especially in autumn after a trip to the annual truffle festival in the nearby city of Alba.\nAlong winding roads that climb steep hillsides blanketed with neat rows of nebbiolo vines, there’s always an ancient castle up ahead, or a world-famous wine estate, or a storybook hamlet with swoon-worthy views. Just bring an appetite.\n\n\nFRIDAY\n4PM VIEWS AND VINO \nFor an overview of the region, begin in the village of La Morra, atop a ridge in western Barolo. Stroll through the handsome historic centre, past Baroque churches and corner wine shops, to Piazza Castello, the town’s scenic – and recently refurbished – main square.\nFrom here, the panorama spans vineyard-striped valleys, faraway villages and the distant snow-capped Alps. For an even better vantage, climb to the top of Torre Campanaria (free), an 18th-century brick bell tower beside the square that affords visitors unobstructed views across the terra-cotta rooftops and beyond.\nLater, head down the street to the Cantina Comunale di La Morra, a community wine shop representing local producers, where you’ll often stumble upon festive cultural events, from art exhibitions to all-are-welcome wine tastings with local musicians playing to Barolo-sipping crowds outside.\n6PM CHAPEL OF COLOUR\nWind down the hill from La Morra and through the rolling vineyards to the Chapel of Barolo, which is actually an art installation, also known as the Chapel of Sol LeWitt and David Tremlett, after the artists who transformed what was originally a one-room brick shelter into a work of art.\nPerched on a crest overlooking the vines, the colour-splashed structure is a popular destination among hikers, picnickers and photo-takers, thanks to its vivid facade, an off-kilter rainbow that stands in stark contrast to nature’s muted hues.\n8.30PM ORIGINAL OSTERIA\nAmid the vineyards on the edge of La Morra, Locanda Fontanazza is a superb restaurant where the innovative menus evolve with the seasons. Inside the split-level dining room – stylishly rustic with a central fireplace and large windows – a recent meal began with soft housemade focaccia and a sublime carne cruda, hand-chopped veal tartare seasoned at the table.\nGlistening ravioli del plin, a traditional meat-stuffed Piedmontese pasta, were instead filled with buttery snails and berbere spices. And for dessert, an icy scoop of gin granita topped chamomile-infused creme brulee. In good weather, ask for a table on the pergola-framed terrace outside. Dinner for two, about €70, or about S$105.\nSATURDAY\n9AM THEATRE IN BLOOM \nIn 2018, the medieval village of Monforte d’Alba earned a spot on the exclusive list of “I borghi piu belli d’Italia,” or “The most beautiful villages in Italy,” which honours small towns of exceptional beauty and cultural value.\nIt’s easy to see why in the historic centre, where steep cobblestone lanes are lined with ochre-and-peach palazzi and rosebushes bloom around every bend. Climb to the town’s apex to find Auditorium Horszowski, an open-air theatre whose grass-covered steps are flanked by a faded-pink oratory and a soaring brick bell tower dating to the 13th century.\nNamed after the Polish-American pianist who inaugurated the venue in 1986, the site is said to have perfect acoustics and hosts an annual summer jazz festival, among other musical and theatrical events.\n11.30AM TASTE THE TERROIR\nWine lovers dream of a visit to the region’s premier producers, to explore the dusty cellars of Cantina Bartolo Mascarello, perhaps, or to discuss the merits of aging in barriques (small oak barrels) during a tasting session with Elio Altare.\nWhatever your depth of knowledge, one of the warmest welcomes in the area awaits at G.D. Vajra, a family-run, biodynamic winery in the hills above Barolo town. Tours of the cantina are led by Milena, the engaging matriarch, and her amiable daughter, Francesca, who intersperse explanations of terroir and winemaking techniques with family lore.\nVisits conclude with a tasting of Vajra’s celebrated wines, from a silky nebbiolo and balanced Barbera d’Alba to an elegant single-vineyard Barolo with hints of violet. Tour and tasting, €20; reservation required.\n1PM LOCAL LUNCH\nSuffering nebbiolo fatigue? A few miles north, in the municipality of Verduno, a handful of vineyards also grow pelaverga, a rare grape variety native to the region that produces a light, easy-drinking red with hints of strawberry and spice and – if you believe the locals – aphrodisiac qualities.\nDecide for yourself over lunch at La Cantina Wine Bar, a corner cafe serving weekend lunch specials. At a table on the breezy porch, start with a glass of Fratelli Alessandria’s fruity Verduno Pelaverga, then nibble through a selection of seven local cheeses or dig into a bowl of gnocchi al Castelmagno, Piedmont’s decadent twist on mac and cheese. Lunch for two, about €30.\n4PM CASTLE CHARMS\nOn a hill about 4 miles (6.5km) east of Verduno, Castello Grinzane Cavour looks like a fairy-tale castle with its stately towers and faded red-brick facade.\nThis ancient fortification, dating to the 11th century, is today a UNESCO World Heritage Site and home of the annual World Alba White Truffle Auction, where truffle enthusiasts from around the globe gather in late autumn to bid on the season’s choicest specimens. In 2018, a tremendous tuber weighing nearly 2 pounds (0.9kg) sold for €85,000.\nHead inside to explore the Museo delle Langhe, an ethnographic museum detailing the region’s food and wine traditions (admission, €6), then wander the tranquil, well-tended grounds for sweeping views of the surrounding vineyards.\n7.30PM SERRALUNGA SUPPER\nBefore dinner, work up an appetite strolling through Serralunga d’Alba, a sleepy village where medieval streets radiate from a slender brick castle with tall watchtowers.\nFor a multi-course feast, reserve a table at Osteria Tre Case, an elegant bilevel restaurant with a series of wood-and-stone dining rooms that’s run by a young local couple. A set menu of Piedmontese specialties includes an outstanding tajarin, a thin ribbonlike pasta made, according to tradition, with 30 egg yolks and served with hearty sausage ragu (four courses, €40).\nOr for more conviviality, duck into the downstairs dining room at Vinoteca Centro Storico, a nearby wine bar, for platters of hand-sliced prosciutto and creamy burrata, a few simple pastas dusted with grated white truffles and one of the deepest wine lists in the area. Dinner for two, without wine, about €40.\nSUNDAY\n9AM TAKE A HIKE\nNever mind the hilly terrain. A network of sentieri, or hiking trails, crisscrosses the region, beckoning mountain bikers, joggers and Sunday strollers into the vineyards and surrounding nature.\nOne lovely route begins in Barolo proper and heads south out of town. Red-and-white trail markers lead to an undulating dirt path that climbs through vineyards, past the occasional goat and along a winding road to the quiet hamlet of Novello, about 2 1/2 miles away.\nSeek out the ornate neo-Gothic castle (now a hotel) at the far edge of town and admire views of the distant Alps before returning to Barolo through the vineyard-strewn hills.\n11AM MUSEUM MORNING \nBack in town, meander along Barolo’s cobblestone lanes toward the ancient castle, an ochre-hued fortification with history dating to the 10th century.\nOriginally a defensive fortress, this towering edifice later served as a country home for the wealthy Falletti family, among other things, but today houses WiMu, the Barolo Wine Museum, where interactive exhibits explore wine through scientific, cultural and historical lenses (admission, €8).\nFor more wine-adjacent history, pop inside the neighbouring Museo dei Cavatappi, a tiny museum chronicling the evolution of the corkscrew, from 18th-century, T-shaped pulls, many with curiously phallic designs, to the efficient wine key and rabbit-style tools used today (€4).\n1PM FINAL SIPS\nWhether you’re looking to buy a bottle or just want a quick sip and a snack, La Vite Turchese should be your last stop before leaving Barolo. This welcoming enoteca excels at personalised wine tastings, so ask to compare barberas from Alba and Asti.\nStaff members, as friendly as they are knowledgeable, will pinpoint vineyards on a map, chat about tasting notes and handpick accompanying snacks, such as local salami, crunchy taralli crackers and ash-covered goat cheese from the region.\nThe two-room bar doubles as a shop stocked with thousands of bottles, so those who like what they taste can also take a bottle (or case) to go.\nLODGING\nIn the centre of the town of Barolo, Casa Svizzera Agriturismo is a six-room bed-and-breakfast run by the Germano family, well-known winemakers in the area who also operate an adjacent wine shop. Some of the recently renovated rooms, including a top-floor suite, have small balconies overlooking the town square (Via Roma, 65, Barolo; casasvizzera.com; doubles from €110).\nIn the oldest part of Monforte d’Alba, Le Case della Saracca is an intriguing property with a bed-and-breakfast and a restaurant tucked within a series of medieval structures. The six guest rooms, some with fireplaces, bring modern comforts to the Middle Ages (Via Cavour, 5, Monforte d’Alba; saracca.com; from €148).\nRental homes large and small are available throughout the region. Recent offerings on HomeAway included a modern apartment in central La Morra (from €95 per night) and a two-bedroom vacation home in the hills outside Monforte d’Alba (from €133).\nIngrid K.

      How China’s love of durian is reshaping the Thai countryside
  </h1>, 'text': ""CHANTHABURI, Thailand and GUANGZHOU, China: This restaurant’s signature dish is durian chicken pot. Its bestseller is spinach with durian fried rice. And it has many more of such dishes, like durian pickled vegetable fish.\nThe founder of Qing Liu Durian Restaurant in Guangzhou, China, discovered the thorny fruit when he travelled to Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand more than a decade ago.\nChen Zhenjiang found it “really tasty”, but many of his friends “wouldn’t touch raw durians”.\n“They’d eat durian products, like durian cake, durian pastry and durian tarts. It made me think why folks who shun raw durians would eat durian products,” says the one-time chef for the Qatari royal family.\n“So I opened this restaurant to make durian products for these people to try.”\nThere is no stink, he adds, because the fragrance goes into the food. And that is how he has been converting non-durian lovers — with “a little taste of durian products first”. “Many of my customers now love durians,” he says.\nNot only his customers but China’s growing middle class has developed a taste for exotic fruits like durian. Between 2009 and 2017, the country’s fresh durian imports grew fourfold, from US$124 million (S$169 million) to US$552 million.\nLast year, the growth exploded as Chinese consumers spent US$1.1 billion, double the amount in 2017.\nThis was in no small part boosted by headlines about an Alibaba flash sale of Thai durians on its retail site, Tmall. Within the opening minute, 80,000 durians were snapped up.\nThailand is the only country allowed to export fresh whole durians directly to mainland China, thanks to a 2003 trade agreement. Of its annual output of around 600,000 tonnes, 70 per cent last year went to the Chinese market.\nWATCH: China's billion-dollar love affair with durian\xa0(3:02)\nThe trade is even triggering a real estate boom in its durian heartland, the series China’s Growing Appetite discovers. But is its domination of the Chinese market a blessing or a curse for the Southeast Asian country?\nDURIAN BONANZA\nThailand’s biggest durian-producing region is Chanthaburi, an eastern province that accounts for 1.2 per cent of the country’s land mass but nearly half of its durian output owing to its favourable soil and climate.\nAnd more Chinese middlemen — from about 100 last year to more than 500 companies this year — are coming to do business, says Chalermpol Sakkham, the mayor of Tha Chang municipality in the province.\n“They know how to export fruit to China. They’ll make everything right to meet the government standard,” he says, full of praise for the durian trade with China.\n“It makes our lives better — not only the farmers in Chanthaburi but also the farmers who plant durians all over Thailand.”\nSelling durians is so lucrative that it is prompting other farmers to jump on the bandwagon. The price of rubber has also slumped over the last few years, so rubber plantations are increasingly being replaced by durian trees.\nTake, for example, Niwat Wongchanta and Jirakul Jetjumonong. The couple cut down their rubber trees five years ago to plant more than 100 durian trees, hoping to ride the tidal wave of Chinese demand.\n“Everyone was enjoying success from planting durians. We also want to be like them. Durian is our hope,” says Jirakul.\nDurian trees take a long time to mature, however, and they will reap their first fruits only next year. Niwat thinks they could get about a million baht (S$45,000) if all their trees produce durians.\nWhile he used to worry that durian might suffer a similar fate as rubber, he now thinks the market “won’t die anytime soon”. His wife agrees: “There are many Chinese middlemen now, so we’re confident.”\nSmall farms like theirs, however, are becoming rare in Chanthaburi as mega plantations take over. Durian Land, for example, covers two square kilometres. And owner Chanogmon Viriyapanichpakdee would buy more land if it is nearby.\n“But the price now is increasing so much,” she says. Land prices are two to three times higher than six years ago, and she herself has thrice had Chinese investors offering her triple what she paid for her plantation.\n“In future I’ll get more,” she reckons.\nAround the province, there are plots of land newly cleared for durian trees and also the packing houses run by Chinese middlemen.\nThese cash-rich businessmen go to the farms, scout for the best harvests, lock them in with an advance contract, hire workers for harvest time and export the durians to China.\nFor local middlemen, the competition is more intense than ever before. “Even if you have a lot of money, it’s easier to buy gold than to buy durians,” says Viroon Oonja, who has been in the business for 20 years.\n“I still can run a business because I have a lot of friends, and I know farmers. We help each other find more durians.”\nGAME CHANGERS\nSomeone else who has been in the durian business for a long time — 25 years — is Kanjana Yaemprai, the president of Queen Frozen Fruit. And when she introduced frozen durian to China three years ago, it was a game changer.\n“We put a stick in it. So it’s easy to carry, easy to buy and easy to eat,” is how her assistant and nephew Pakpum Bhagpabhakorn describes their product that looks like ice lolly and “doesn’t smell that much”.\nWhile frozen durians are not new, the company does a faster and deeper freeze (-60°C for eight hours) to reduce the ice crystals inside the fruit and give it a creamier texture.\nThis has boosted the popularity of frozen durian and made the fruit available all year round to the Chinese. And it offers a way to export lower-grade durians.\n“We do contract farming, and we need to harvest all the fruits … in the farm,” says Pakpoom. “That’s why we built the factory … to make frozen durian.”\nLast year, the company exported 160 containers of the frozen durian to China, or 1.12 million durians. “(Chinese buyers) would just say, ‘I’ll take all of whatever you have,’” he adds.\nHe is now “a bit” worried, however, because Malaysia has been allowed to export frozen whole durians directly to mainland China from this year.\nWATCH: Malaysia can now export frozen whole durians to China (2:06)\n“Nowadays, Chinese people know only about the Mao Shan Wang (or Musang King) durian,” he says. “We export much more than Musang King (suppliers do) to China, but (consumers) don’t know about the name of the durian from Thailand.”\nThailand’s main durian export is the Monthong (Golden Pillow) variety, but branding is a “weak point”, he admits. “Maybe next year, we’ll find a partner who can (create) a stronger brand for Thai durian.”\nWith or without branding, however, the durian is now a symbol of affluence to the Chinese.\nAt the Jiangnan Fruit and Vegetable Market in Guangzhou, the price has risen from 55 yuan (S$10.70) a case to 480 yuan in the 20 years Peng Xueling has been selling durians.\n“In the past, we sold 100 to 200 cases a day; now we sell 700 to 800,” she says. “A lot of people have accepted the taste of durian.”\nIn contrast, the Thais have tightened their belts. In the decade to 2017, their durian consumption fell to 20 per cent of what it used to be as farmers diverted local supply to exports.\nAt the Iyara market on the outskirts of Bangkok — one of the country's largest fresh fruit markets — durian seller Adisak Prangthaptim remembers how it was before China’s appetite started growing.\n“The best durians cost 120 baht per kilogramme; the good-quality durians cost 60 to 80 baht,” he cites. “Now, lower-quality durians cost 200 baht; good-quality durians are exported to fetch higher prices.”\nLamenting the issue of local affordability, he adds: “More Chinese consumers eating durian benefits the farmers and the middlemen. But it’s bad for the retailer.”\nAs to whether Thai consumers are unhappy about buying durian less often, it depends on who you ask. As one of them says, “It’s okay because selling (durian) to other countries (means more) money coming in.”\nRead about how the Amazon is left counting the cost of China's hunger for food.

      His dad is Michelin starred. Chef Joe Leong is trying to step out of his shadow
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: At almost every birthday celebration and graduation ceremony of his when he was younger, Joe Leong did not get to spend it with his father.\nThat was life growing up with a father on top of his game as a well-known chef.\nThey did not even celebrate Chinese New Year as families usually do, because they were operating a Chinese restaurant and that was the busiest time of the year.\n“(My father) would bring home a dish of yusheng, run to everybody’s door (and start knocking) … ‘Wake up! Come out and eat something,’” recounts Joe.\n“All of us would (go) to the kitchen or the dining area. We’d lo hei — just a very quick supper — then go back to sleep.”\nFor dad Sam Leong, the working day was 8am to midnight. And that was his life.\n“The kitchen or home — there are no other places I go to,” says the celebrity chef, whose Forest restaurant in Resorts World Sentosa is Michelin-starred. “I can’t do much (else) because my responsibilities at work (are) too much.\n“That’s why I never wanted my children to come into the culinary (arts).”\nSo when his younger son wanted to be a chef too, he not only disagreed but also was “so angry”, Joe remembers.\nAfter nine years now working in the kitchen, however, the 26-year-old no longer has to worry about gaining his father’s approval. Instead, what he is trying to do is step out from under his father’s shadow.\nWATCH: My celebrity chef dad didn\'t want me to be a cook (4:23)\nThe programme On The Red Dot finds out what happens when a child follows in a famous parent’s footsteps. (Watch the episode here.)\nRUNS IN THE FAMILY\nBeing a chef was actually not what Joe expected when he was in school. His interests were in tennis and music. But one day, his father sat him down and talked about “shelf life”.\n“Because in music and tennis, it isn’t easy to make a name for yourself. Let’s say I make (a career) in tennis, what can I do? Tennis coach? I didn’t see myself doing that,” he says.\n“(Or) you might play music for 50 years till you die. No one would notice you at all. So he said, why don’t you try something more stable?”\nWhile his father “didn’t know why” he ended up in the same trade, it was what he was exposed to, he points out, “ever since I was born”.\n“I grew up in a family of chefs. My grandfather was a chef,” he says. “My aunty, my uncles (were) all somewhat … in the food and beverage industry.\n“My mum and my grandmother were always in the kitchen cooking. I’d usually sit inside the kitchen … waiting for food.”\nSo that was also how he grew up — watching his parents cook. And it rubbed off.\nAfter his O levels, he started out in pastries at 2am:dessertbar by Janice Wong. It was his father, having eventually accepted his choice, who guided him towards that first job in 2010.\n“I went in with zero knowledge, but I went in with connections,” he admits. “People said, ‘Oh, just because you’re Sam Leong’s son, you got into this place very easily. Oh, you rise up (through the ranks) so quickly.’”\nWhat people did not see, he says, is how he tried to live up to expectations. “(If) people worked eight hours, maybe I worked 12 hours … Definitely, it was hard because of the pressure,” he adds.\nMy social life (was) gone … My friends — almost all of them \xad— I’ve lost touch (with) already.\nBut he has not looked back. He went on to Swissotel the Stamford and Fairmont Singapore, InterContinental Singapore and the Tippling Club, specialising in pastry and dessert.\n“I do every single thing, from production to regular cakes to fine dining dessert,” he says.\n‘CAN’T ESCAPE’ HIS BACKGROUND\nWhen chef Lee Jing Peng first met Joe in 2016 at the Tippling Club, “he was very quiet and shy”. But his skill spoke for itself.\n“He really grew a lot … and he came up with all his desserts that wowed customers. He (transformed) the chocolate tart into a modern interpretation that no one expected. How could a chocolate tart be so nice?” Lee effuses.\nAfter working as a junior sous chef at Forest restaurant, Joe joined V-Zug’s V Dining restaurant in July and now manages its pastry. He is also in charge of its high tea, which includes the theme and the desserts, explains head chef Lee.\nIt is not only what he makes, but also how he works that has earned him his boss’s respect.\n“Chef Joe has a kind of charisma. When something’s very boring, he can make it very interesting. No matter how bad his day is, he still smiles,” says Lee.\n“I can’t even do that, honestly. If I get angry about some mistakes that my staff do, I’d flare (up) at them. But he doesn’t … He’d still patiently teach you to do all the things he wants you to do.”\nEven as Joe is beginning to make a name for himself, he admits he “can’t escape” his family background. “Many people (go), ‘Oh, you’re Chef Sam’s son. Oh, you must be very good,’” he cites.\nLee has seen this too. “Some guests come in and say, ‘Chef Joe Leong? Leong? Is (he) Chef Sam Leong’s son?” Then they’d (be) like, ‘Wah, I finally get to see you in real life,’” he describes.\n“He feels a little bit reluctant to answer because people tend to ask a lot of questions.”\nWherever his father goes, says Joe, people notice him. It is a reputation he has built over 30 years — one he has also been acclaimed for in past Channel 8 shows, like Star Chef and King Of The Kitchen.\nIn fact, he was still the reason his son got into V Dining.\n“Chef Joe was introduced by Chef Lee … I rejected him because I didn’t know about Chef Joe. But later on, I came to know that he’s Sam Leong’s son,” discloses Angeline Yap, V-Zug’s managing director for Singapore and Southeast Asia.\n(Sam) is a very humble guy and very down-to-earth, even (though) he’s won Michelin stars. I can see the similarities (between Joe) and his father. That’s also one of the main reasons I hired him.\n“Whenever we introduce (Joe), we’d say that he’s Sam Leong’s son because … everybody remembers (Sam),"" she adds.\nOVERCOMING ADVERSITY\nBy his own admission, Sam is “not a dessert fan”. But when he got the chance recently to visit his son at work, and make pastry together for the first time, he was “impressed” with Joe.\nThis, coming from a man who is the “boss” and “king”, so “everything he says must go”, his son says with a laugh.\n“Usually, when I ask him for advice on cooking, he’d be very strict about it. So for pastries, he has to do it my way already. So it’s something different, something good,” Joe adds.\nWhat his father discovered is that making pastry “needs a lot of patience” and is “a bit (of a) different culture”. Sam tells him: “It’s my blessing to have desserts from you.”\nSpending time with his two sons — the elder one is a teacher — is something the 53-year-old tries to do more nowadays.\nIt was three years ago, at a check-up, when he was found to have nose cancer. And the details are still fresh in Joe’s memory.\n“My mum gave us a call. My mum said, ‘Oh, your dad has cancer.’ A week later … he told us the news: Stage 4,” he recalls.\nThe diagnosis “shook the whole family”, says Sam, who quickly went for chemotherapy treatment. “This was the first time in my career that I did nothing,” he adds. Every day after treatment, (I just) came back (to) rest.”\nOnly then did he also notice the view from the balcony of his home of 18 years. “My God, I could see Chinese Garden, I could see Jurong Point — which I didn’t have time to do (before),” he recounts.\nThey thought he might be gone in a year, but he pulled through, and they “grew closer as a family”, says Joe, who is now married. “We’re still busy with our jobs, but we try to spend more time together.”\nUninterrupted sit-down dinners, for example, are not as rare as they used to be. “It (didn’t) happen more than five times,” Sam reckons.\n(When) Joe and his brother were in school, halfway through dinner, (there’d be) one phone call and … I’d need to go back (to work).\n“Cancer may have been a signal … that I should slow down a little bit to appreciate (life) more,"" he adds.\nJoe calls him a “role model” who is “very passionate” about his work, and hopes to achieve “something similar”. But mum Forest points out that her younger son “has his own talents” and a “different mindset” from his father.\n“Joe has found his own way and … we’re very proud of him,” she says. Sam agrees, adding: “I didn’t teach him what to do. I just gave Joe some (guidance).”\nIt may have been tough when younger to understand his father’s absence, but their bond is strong. “He taught us (not to) give up halfway, (to) try to focus on one thing, work hard (and) be humble,” cites Joe.\n“He gave us shelter; he gave us food; he gave us a nice life.”\nWatch the episode here.

      Award winning nasi kerabu recipe changes fortune of Kelantan family
  </h1>, 'text': 'KUALA TERENGGANU: Ms Sufazreen Nazifa Mohd Fauzi is only 23, but the business administration graduate is already the chief executive of a thriving business.\nShe heads the business arm of her family’s nasi kerabu restaurant chain in Terengganu. Fauzi Nasi Kerabu has only two outlets in Kuala Terengganu. Both have become popular among locals as go-to places to sample one of the\xa0most famous dishes on the east coast of Malaysia.\nThe restaurant was among those recognised in the Top 50 World Street Food Master Awards in 2017. The dish attracts long queues every morning at both outlets, which typically sell out by 1pm.\nNasi kerabu is an herbed rice dish easily identified by its striking blue colour, which comes from cooking the rice with flower petals of the butterfly pea. The rice is typically served with chicken, fish, pickles and salads.\nWhile it originated in Kelantan, nasi kerabu has gained popularity for its unique combination of being healthy and rich in taste. It has since spread to Terengganu, Perak and even southern Thailand.\nMs Sufazreen’s family also hails from Kelantan. Her parents and nine siblings moved south from Kelantan’s Pasir Mas district to Kuala Terengganu around 14 years ago in search of a better life.\nFROM TRUCK DRIVER TO SUCCESSFUL RESTAURANT OWNER\nIn an interview with CNA, Ms Sufazreen recounted that the restaurant had\xa0humble beginnings.\nWhen the family first moved to Terengganu, her father, Mohd Fauzi Mat Salleh, worked relentless shifts as a lorry driver, while her mother, Sumaiyah Mustapha, sold kuih (snacks) on the side.\nThe family lived in a small rental flat and struggled to make ends meet.\n“We used to live in a small house, all 12 of us. When my siblings and I went to school, we would just bring our own meals from home as we could not afford canteen food. It was really difficult,” said Ms Sufazreen.\nBut her parents soldiered on – they collected whatever little money they earned to buy a small van. They would then sell nasi kerabu from the back of their van at pasar malams. The recipe was Mdm Sumaiyah’s family recipe that had been passed down for generations.\n“Alhamdullilah, when we started selling at pasar malams, for seven nights a week, customers were happy with our food. More and more people came and (we) managed to earn some money to uplift\xa0our lives slightly,” said Ms Sufazreen.\n“We used the income from pasar malams to buy our first family home for RM 500,000 (US$120,218), open a restaurant in Kuala Terengganu, and the blessings just followed,” she added.\n“We had enough money for each of the siblings and their families to buy their own homes, and some of us got cars for ourselves. Me and some of my siblings also managed to further our education, and that was key,” added\xa0Ms Sufazreen.\xa0\nShe enjoys applying what she has learnt from university to the family business, as her parents relinquished operations last year. Mr Mohd Fauzi is 51 and Mdm Sumaiyah is 46.\n“Mak (Mom) and Ayah (dad) are getting older, so we the younger generation have to come forward. We can’t let their hard work go to waste,” Ms Sufazreen said.\nThe young entrepreneur, who only recently took the lead in running Fauzi Nasi Kerabu, is determined to maintain the quality of her family’s nasi kerabu. During the restaurant’s first decade, Mdm Sumaiyah would lead all the cooking preparation to ensure standards were not compromised.\nNow that she is retired, Ms Sufazreen has stepped up to the plate.\n“For our speciality dish, nasi kerabu, we obtain all our ingredients fresh (on) the same morning we serve our customers,” she said.\n“Our dish is also relatively healthy. There’s a lot of fibre from the vegetables we use. We use grilled chicken, beef and lamb, and don’t use any oil for our protein,” added Ms Sufazreen.\nSECRET GRAVY\nAlthough authentic nasi kerabu is typically served without gravy, the restaurant offers a red sweet-sour sauce that is poured over the rice.\nThe gravy is the restaurant’s ace in the hole in attracting local customers, as well as tourists from Kuala Lumpur, Johor and even Singapore, said Ms Sufazreen.\nA regular\xa0customer, who wanted to be known only as Ms Wan, told CNA that the sauce is the reason she comes back at least once a fortnight.\n“I’ve asked (the owners) what they use to make the gravy, but it’s a family secret. Nasi kerabu can sometimes be savoury and crunchy, and the gravy complements it perfectly,” she said.\nAnother customer, Mr Mohd Sufian Mohd Farid, said the restaurant has “perfected” the recipe.\nHowever, Fauzi Nasi Kerabu has also developed “instagrammable” drinks to go with the meal, like its Teh Peng Jebok, an iced milk tea with froth that overflows from the\xa0glass.\nMs Sufazreen acknowledged\xa0that it is important to come up with new ideas so that younger customers will keep returning. Despite that, she added that it was important for the business to maintain the tradition of one of Malaysia’s most iconic street food.\n“There are many other competitors in this region, but we have to make sure our taste stands out. The gravy and freshness of ingredients play an important role,” she said. “There can be no compromise.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     Malaysia ', '     food ']}"

      China is hungry for food. The Amazon is left counting the cost
  </h1>, 'text': ""MATO GROSSO, Brazil: It is the world’s largest rainforest, containing 10 per cent of the world’s known biodiversity. And it is paying the price for helping to feed a country 17,000 kilometres away.\nBetween 2015 and last year, 29,000 square km of Brazil’s part of the Amazon were deforested. That is 40 times the size of Singapore. Up to 80 per cent of this land clearance has been driven by cattle ranching.\nAnd the largest buyer of all that meat is China. Brazil’s beef exports to the Chinese market have more than doubled since 2015, to 722,000 tonnes last year.\nChina’s food consumption is not only growing, but also changing as the ranks of its middle class swell to nearly 30 per cent of its 1.4 billion-strong population.\n“More and more people are eating beef,” says Liu Juan, a beef wholesaler at Beijing’s Xinfadi Market, which has some 8,000 stalls. “If we’d relied only on domestic production, we wouldn’t have met the demand.”\nIndeed, Chinese beef imports have jumped by about 50 times since 2011, reaching a million tonnes last year.\nBut this newfound love of beef as well as the country’s demand for soya are making an impact on the environment and on local tribes halfway round the world, the series China’s Growing Appetite discovers.\nTo put food on China’s tables, landscapes are about to be changed.\nWORLD’S LARGEST CATTLE HERD\nChina consumes 28 per cent of the world’s meat. And it has turned to Brazil, home to the world’s largest cattle herd, to feed its appetite for beef.\nThe Brazilian state of Mato Grosso alone has about 30 million cattle, which is 10 times its human population and more than the 26 million cattle in all of Australia.\n“Brazil is the only country today that has the volume to feed China,” says cattle farm owner Arlindo Jose Vilela.\n“If we (in Brazil) have enough slaughterhouses approved (by China), we could send up to 25 per cent of the production to China.”\nLast year, Brazil shipped 1.64 million tonnes of beef, 44 per cent of which went to China. It is the highest export volume in history by a beef nation. And it is a bonanza time for the farmers.\nThe price of forequarter cuts going to China has already increased from US$4.50 (S$6.10) per kilogramme in 2017 to US$6 this year.\nVilela believes that within 10 years, however, “we’ll be dealing with volumes that are three to four times more”. He predicts: “Brazilian beef is going to be very common in China.”\nThe reason is the swathes of unexploited land north of Mato Grosso, which will allow more cattle to be raised for export.\nBut there is the rub, because Amazonian forests are being cleared for farms at a worsening rate. In the first nine months of this year, deforestation was up by 93 per cent from last year.\nProtections for the forest and indigenous lands have been loosened especially since Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro took office in January. Under his reign, deforestation is at a 10-year peak.\n“The previous governments cared about environmental regulations,” says agronomist and adjunct professor Isaias da Silva Pereira from the Agroecology Centre in the Federal Institute of Para, Campus Itaituba.\n“Nowadays with all the changes, this new government seems to be treating this as a secondary issue, especially the dismantling of the federal environmental protection agencies.”\nOne of the cattle farms with pastures converted from forested land belongs to Valmir Climaco de Aguiar, the mayor of Itaituba town in Para state. And he is proud of his expanding farm, never mind that trees were cut down.\n“We can’t produce inside the forest,” he says matter-of-factly.\nWe have more than 200 million people. We have to eat, produce, sell, export and make money.\nChina, he points out, is not going to pay him “to preserve the forest”. “When a country has high spending power and a lot of people to feed, then it’s the best country (to sell to),” he adds.\nDespite the rising prices, Brazil’s abundant land makes its beef economical to import, compared with China raising more of its own cattle.\nChina has 6 to 8 per cent of the world's grassland area, but that is being encroached on by urban expansion. And its domestic meat is already more expensive because of the land cost.\n“In other countries, the farm owners are the ones rearing cattle. They own the land. In China, the cattle-rearing businesses have to lease the land, which is an additional cost,” explains Cheng Guangyan, an authority on China’s food consumption trends.\nCattle rearing in China also involves mostly small-scale farms. “Big cattle farms need to hire workers, so there’s a labour cost,” says Cheng, a director in the Institute of Food and Nutrition Development, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs.\n“(They also) would contract with small family farms to bring up their calves. It’s cheaper that way because the cost of leasing land is high.”\nGRAIN EXPECTATIONS\nChina still has a massive livestock industry, which is why the country is buying not only Brazilian beef, but also soya beans, a vital grain in animal feed.\nTariffs on American soya beans have made Chinese buyers look elsewhere, so 75 per cent of their soya bean imports last year came from Brazil as its shipments to China jumped by almost a third.\nPretty much all of the US$5 million worth of soya beans produced yearly on the Santa Guarita farm, for example, goes to China. But it is an “expensive journey”, says second-generation farm owner Joel Strobel.\nWe’re in the middle of the continent. So the cost of exporting soya beans, for us, is high because a big part of it is road freight.\nAccording to a local soya bean lobby, transport accounts for 30 per cent of the production costs in Brazil, which is three times more than in the United States. And the logistical challenge is increasing as exports grow.\nFrom the centre of Brazil’s agribusiness, Mato Grosso, the farmers’ only route to the country’s northern port cities is the BR-163 highway cutting across the Amazon. That 1,700-km drive takes two and a half days off-season.\nCome harvest time, however, trucks can be backed up for miles. A stretch of the road is also not paved, which makes it dangerous during the rainy season and adds to the journey time.\nTo ease the bottleneck, infrastructure projects have been proposed, one of which is to build more than 40 dams to turn the Tapajos River and its tributaries in the Amazon into an industrial waterway fit for large ships.\nItaituba, with a population of about 100,000 and where highway meets river, is already seeing signs of change such as river port construction projects.\nIts strategic location in the soya bean trade between Brazil and China — and their ambitions to open up a new food frontier, with the backing of Chinese engineering — have got its mayor excited.\nAnd he is not worried about borrowing from the Chinese. “China’s going to rule the world,” Climaco declares. “If it wasn’t for China, there wouldn’t be so much production of soya beans.”\nBut the indigenous people who live in the forest are not pleased at such plans. Already, the Munduruku tribe is feeling the effects of the town’s recent transformation; for example, there is no longer enough fish to make fishing viable.\n“Our god gave us this river,” says Brasilino, a village chief. “It’s our responsibility to take care of it. But now we’re not able to do that … because they’re depleting the land and bringing more diseases through the dirty water.”\nThe type of economic development that would come with damming the river is not what he wants for his people.\n“It’s good for the government. But the salary of the working man doesn’t increase. (Even if it does,) it’s very little,” he says. “We have a healthier life. We can walk around the trees and breathe clean air.”\nHe has this to say to China: “Stop farming soya beans in the Amazon.”\nEnvironmental activist Brent Millikan makes the point that the Amazon “isn’t like any other place”.\n“Where investments are happening, it’s important for Chinese investors to understand what the local context is — environmentally (and) culturally,” says the Amazon programme director at non-governmental organisation International Rivers.\n“The big question is what sort of policies China will adopt to make sure that its investments are living up to its standards in terms of social and environmental safeguards.”\nSome dams in the Tapajos basin are already being constructed and operated, and have had a socio-environmental impact, he adds.\n“If you have a government now that’s encouraging land invasions, land violence (and) deforestation, things are going to be detrimental to Brazilians … to the Chinese (and) to the whole planet.”\nWatch this first episode of China's Growing Appetite tonight, Nov 16,\xa0at 9pm.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     environment ', '     food ', '     CNA Insider ']}"

      How chef Andre Chiang plans to make his Japan debut with a modern teahouse
  </h1>, 'text': 'It has been two years since chef Andre Chiang shocked the culinary world with news that he would be\xa0closing his eponymous two Michelin-starred restaurant in Singapore. But\xa0as surprising and even heartbreaking as it was\xa0for both his team and fans of Chiang’s uniquely\xa0progressive style of cuisine, it was a decision the\xa0revered chef and entrepreneur needed to make.\n“I’m happy right now, even happier than those days behind the kitchen of Restaurant Andre,” a noticeably relaxed Chiang told us recently. His days are now filled with purposeful travels – to learn more about the world’s diverse food culture; mentor the chefs of the Andre Chiang Global (ACG) group who work for restaurants such as Porte 12 in Paris; and run several new concepts in China including The Bridge in Chengdu and\xa0Sichuan Moon at Wynn Palace in Macau.\nEducating the next generation also features prominently on his agenda. He frequently gives lectures to inspire the younger generation and visits culinary schools such as Asia University and Fu Jen Catholic University in Taiwan to share with students “things cooking school would never teach them”.\nTo him, these things have to do with seasonality, aesthetics, colour combination, as well as branding, marketing and the economics of running a restaurant. “If you want to showcase your style in your own restaurant, these are essential, but schools never teach you about it,” Chiang added.\n\n\nCOMBINING FRENCH DESSERTS WITH TAIWANESE TEA\nOne of the latest stops in his hectic schedule is Kyoto, for a pop-up event at Kaikado cafe to promote his new project in Taipei – a cafe that combines French dessert tradition with Taiwanese tea culture. “One Tree Hill is our ninth baby,” he said, referring to the latest concept under ACG that opened in October last year.\nServing us his favourite Macanese egg tarts that he had hand-carried, Chiang shared how he was only going to be in Kyoto for 22 hours for the pop-up, before heading to Tokyo to cook at a four-hands event with his friend, Lionel Beccat, executive chef of two Michelin-starred French restaurant, Esquisse. “Then I go to Kanazawa for 17 hours for my new B&B project,” he added.\nTHE ALLURE OF JAPAN\nWe recall what Chiang said on the last day of operations for Restaurant Andre about his future plans “to work for Asia”, noting that he was highly inspired to introduce Asian food culture and techniques, along with the region’s growing pool of talented chefs, to the rest of the world. We had also asked then if he was thinking about doing something in Japan, to which he simply replied, “I haven’t planned it yet”. Well, it seems that the time has finally come.\nGranted, while Japan’s economy is still struggling in some areas, it appears the timing could not be better. Chiang is confident that if the “political condition remains stable, F&B will naturally work better”.\n“The Japanese have more international experience and they are coming back home, but they’re not staying in big cities like Tokyo,” he explained, adding that it was this trend that drew him even closer to Japan. Previously, it was the country’s craftsmen that kept Chiang inspired to invest in a business in the country. The two-day One Tree Hill pop-up, for example, was held at Kaikado cafe, which is owned and run by a sixth-generation tea caddy maker, Takahiro Yagi, who is a good friend of Chiang’s.\nThe two share a mutual love for the artisanal. In fact, 45-year-old Yagi’s warm demeanour is also affirmation of his iron will to keep the tradition of tea caddy-making alive for the next generation. “My father told me not to succeed the business, because it is a declining industry,” he shared. “But I [believe] there is potential in the international market.”\nSeven years ago, Yagi and like-minded inheritors in the country’s varied craft industry banded together to form the group called Go On, which travels the world to showcase traditional Japanese crafts and heritage. In Kyoto, Kaikado is the place for these craftsmen to mingle and showcase their wares laced with history.\n\n\nKANAZAWA: WHERE FOOD AND CRAFT OVERLAP\nThis is the first time Chiang has done a pop-up of One Tree Hill, and he is already thinking of opening a branch in Tokyo. But his official first project will be in Kanazawa, located\xa0two hours by train from Kyoto. Kanazawa also embraces the beauty of craftsmanship and tradition and is home to a lot of young talent.\n“I\xa0love\xa0Kanazawa. I would like to live there,” Chiang declared, having bought a machiya (a traditional Japanese shophouse) for his personal use. “The place has\xa0everything – culture, history, crafts and quality ingredients, especially seafood.”\nHe co-owns, with a group of Taiwanese artists, another six machiyas in Ishibiki, near the Kenrokuen Garden, with the aim of converting each of them into a boutique bed-and-breakfast.\n“In the past, food and craft never [really] overlapped, and other restaurants were considered competitors. Now,\xa0people connected with the same philosophy could work together and share the customers. If I have 100\xa0followers, and the other [business]\xa0has 100\xa0followers,\xa0we can reach 200 followers. It needs to be the same group\xa0of people with\xa0the same priority and preference. If it works, we can offer a full experience,” Chiang shared.\nHe added that while more people these days travel for food, his aim is to offer a curated experience that would incorporate a chance to discover the city and its culture. He hopes to complete this project by mid-2020.\n', 'related_topics': ['     food ', '     gastronomy ', '     Restaurants ', '     Travel ', '     Japan ']}"

      Wholemeal or multigrain? The truth about ‘healthier’ breads
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The market share of wholemeal bread has increased from 28 per cent to 39 per cent in the past five years, new statistics from the Health Promotion Board (HPB) show.\nIncreased wholegrain intake has been associated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, including stroke.\nOne bread lover who has made that switch is Jaclyn Kee. The higher fibre content in the wholemeal and multigrain varieties also usually keeps her children from snacking.\n“In terms of weight control, I think it’s pretty good,” she says. “Also, I read somewhere that it helps boost their concentration, so I encourage them to eat it for breakfast or in between meals.”\nEven at the National Day Rally in 2017, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong disclosed that he watches his diet by, for example, choosing wholemeal instead of white bread.\nAre wholemeal and multigrain breads really so healthy, or is that marketing hype? The truth may be surprising, as the programme Talking Point finds out. (Watch the episode here.)\nSIMILAR TO INSTANT NOODLES\nWhether it is wholemeal, multigrain or regular white, mass-produced bread is defined as ultra-processed food — and belongs in the same category as sausages and instant noodles.\n“They’ve got a lot more additives and emulsifiers, or different kinds of stabilisers, to extend the shelf life of the bread,” explains Khoo Teck Puat Hospital senior principal dietician Gladys Wong.\nThe term “ultra-processed food” refers to foods that have gone through substantial industrial processing and typically contain high amounts of sugar, salt and saturated fat, for example.\nSome of these additional ingredients help to make the bread texture “a bit softer”, says Wong. They are also used to enhance flavour, especially in white bread.\nThese kinds of food additives are usually denoted by E numbers. For example, E100 to E199 mean food colouring, E200 to E299 are preservatives, E300 to E399 are antioxidants, and E400 to 499 are thickeners, emulsifiers and stabilisers.\nUltra-processed foods would be things like chocolate as well as some fruit juices and breakfast cereals, cites Wong. “Anything that can last very long … probably has got a lot more additives.”\nSome mass-produced wholemeal and multigrain breads may also not be baked with 100 per cent wholemeal flour.\nFor example, at BreadTalk, the wholemeal and multigrain recipes may contain only 30 per cent wholemeal flour, says chef Lim Meng Poh, a senior trainer at the bakery. White flour is needed “to improve the final product — the texture”.\n“It looks nicer,” he says. “(With) 100 per cent wholemeal flour, the final product would come out a little bit hard, dry and the shelf life would be shorter.”\nWhite flour has little nutrients and a high glycaemic index, which means a higher risk of diabetes. So how healthy is wholemeal bread if there is white flour in it?\nAs long as wholemeal flour is on the ingredient list, says HPB nutritionist Melissa Koh, “it’s still better than 100 per cent white flour”.\nWhat consumers can do is look out for the Healthy Choice Symbol on the packaging, she advises. Bread with that logo contains at least 25 per cent more wholegrains, which have nutrients that are good for the body.\nStudies show that eating more wholegrains … protects us from developing chronic diseases in the long term.\nThere are multigrain breads, however, that are made of 100 per cent white flour, “with just some multigrain blends on top”, she warns.\n“The ingredients are usually listed in order of the quantity used. So if you’re looking for a solid wholemeal bread, wholemeal as an ingredient should be listed as one of the first few.""\nHEALTHIER OPTIONS\nOn the other hand, artisan breads present a healthier alternative, but cost more. So are they worth the price?\nMaster baker Nick Chua from Nick Vina Artisan Bakery is one who offers heathier choices such as sprouted wheat, rye, cornmeal and spelt bread. These use different types of flour and are not mixed with white flour.\n“For these kinds of bread, the different types of flour bring … different textures and flavours to the breads,” he says.\nThe sprouted wheat bread, for example, contains wheat germ (part of the kernel), bran and a high level of fibre, while rye bread contains four times the fibre of white bread and 20 per cent fewer calories.\nAs for spelt flour — a wholegrain relative of wheat flour — it has around 20 per cent more protein than traditional wheat flours and is a good source of vitamin B2.\n“We ferment (the yeasts) for more than 24 hours to let the wheat flavour slowly come out,” says Chua, who stresses that no emulsifiers are added to improve the texture, flavour, colour or shelf life.\nThese artisanal breads are priced at upwards of S$6 — about two to three times the price of a mass-produced wholemeal loaf in the supermarket.\n“At first, they were very difficult to sell,” admits Chua. “(Locals) tend to eat the soft breads. So when we started, we needed to educate customers on how to eat them.”\nFor the true weight-watchers, there are also keto buns, which do not use sugar and are gluten-free, as there is no wheat either. They are also low in carbohydrates because they are made with almond flour.\nAt the bakery Seriously Keto, each bun has “only three grammes of carbs”, says its founder Janti Joso Brasali — in comparison with 15g in a slice of white bread.\nEach bun has 8g more fat compared with a slice of white bread, but she adds that these are good, monounsaturated fats with omega-3 fatty acids.\n“It could be higher in fat because of the almond flour. Also, we use eggs … and the psyllium husk (a soluble fibre),” explains the 54-year-old, who adopted a ketogenic diet two years ago and started her bakery here this year.\nSuch wholefoods do not come cheap: Two buns cost almost S$9.\n“So not all breads are created equal. Newer varieties often come with a heftier price tag,” notes Talking Point host Steven Chia.\nAs to make whether they are necessarily healthier, he concludes that “looking at the labels on that loaf of bread” would help make for informed decisions.\nWatch this episode here.

Since then, the Da Paolo brand has become a household name in Singapore, with seven Da Paolo Gastronomia outlets across the island, a Pizza Bar, Bistro Bar, and the Da Paolo HQ along Club Street.\nJust last month, the company debuted its largest and most ambitious endeavour yet: Da Paolo Dempsey Restaurant & Bar. Spread over 5,000 sq. ft., the restaurant and retail emporium wasn’t planned as a commemoration of the company’s 30th anniversary, but as Da Paolo’s CEO Guillaume Pichoir puts it: “The stars really aligned.”\n\n\nIT WASN’T REALLY A PLAN\nPaolo and Judie retired nine years ago, leaving the company in the hands of their son Andrea, now Group Executive Chef; daughter Francesca, who heads Product Management and Marketing, and her husband Guillaume, CEO. In that time, the trio have really gotten to know one another as co-workers and built a firm framework for the business upon which it can grow.\nStructure, said Guillaume, was the first order of the day when he took over as CEO in 2010. “(The business) was like any organically grown family business – not a lot of delegation, some micromanagement, and not a big emphasis on structure and building a team.”\nSimilarly, Francesca and Andrea joining the family business happened as organically as the business’s growth. “I don’t think my parents thought we would join the company,” said Francesca, 36. “I was studying biomedical science in Melbourne and hoping to go into post-grad medicine. My parents knew that. Then just before my exams, my mum asked if I was going to come back (to Singapore) or stay in Melbourne. And I said, ‘I think I want to come back and work for you.’ She said, ‘It’s either you stay or you’re coming back to work for us. There’s no ‘I think’ or ‘I try’.”\nShe laughed at the memory. “I wasn’t ready for my exams and I knew I wasn’t going to do well. So I said, ‘ok, I’m coming back’.”\n\n\nA post shared by Da Paolo Group (@dapaolosg)\nCooking wasn’t Andrea’s ambition either. “I gave it a shot because it was a free ticket to Italy,” the 32-year-old said with wry candour. “Dad told me that he would send me to Italy after NS (national service) to go to an international culinary school for a year, and that they spoke English there. All that was true, except that they didn’t speak English.”\nThe language barrier made adjusting to his fatherland difficult, but it was the challenge itself that kept Andrea going. “I love challenges. This was a Michelin-star kind of school and it’s not like you go in there and learn to fry eggs. I remember on the first day, everyone introduced themselves and talked about all the starred restaurants they had worked at. I could only say that I had just come from NS. So I had to prove to them that I could be as good as them at the end of it all.”\n\n\nA post shared by Da Paolo Group (@dapaolosg)\n\n\nFAMILIAL FAMILIARITY\nAs Da Paolo’s executive chef, Andrea oversees operations of the central and restaurant kitchens. He develops the company’s menus alongside Francesca, who refines their product list by listening to customers and observing what sells and doesn’t. With previous management experience in an MNC, Guillaume sets the direction for the company and its concepts.\n“We work well as a team,” affirmed Francesca. “We know each other well and respect each other’s expertise. We know that we can’t do the other person’s job better. I think the key thing is that everyone has a role to play and we respect that.”\nWhile the business now enjoys a corporate structure, it is still the familial ties that bind. “There’s no game like in a corporate environment where people have different agendas,” said Guillaume, 45. “We’re all in it together. There’s an alignment of targets and goals.”\n“The best thing is knowing that they’re always there,” added Andrea. “It doesn’t matter if you’ve taken a day off or gone on vacation. The family’s always there. That’s the nice thing.”\n“Of course, the worst thing is that you never switch off,” Guillaume said, grinning. ”Especially for Francesca and me. We go home, we’re in bed and we’re talking about work. It’s hard to separate.”\n“It doesn’t matter if you’ve taken a day off or gone on vacation. The family’s always there. That’s the nice thing.” – Andrea Scarpa\n\n\nIT’S COME TO THIS\nIn the last nine years, the trio has been busy refining Da Paolo’s concepts, renovating some of their outlets and opening new ones. The new flagship in Dempsey represents the culmination of everything they’ve learnt so far, all housed under one stylish roof.\nOccupying the sprawling space vacated by gourmet grocer Culina (which moved to another location in Dempsey), Da Paolo Dempsey Restaurant & Bar exudes breezy Southern Italian charm with its white-washed walls, an upside-down olive tree hanging from the ceiling, and faux lemon grove accents that bestow a verdant, sunny vibe. A row of glossy counters displays a mind-boggling selection of excellent Italian gelato (the pistachio gelato is insanely good), unique Italian cheeses, fresh pastas, pastries, breads, cured meats, and sourdough-based Neapolitan pizzas made in a wood-fired oven.\xa0 \xa0\nA terrazzo-topped bar anchors the space, serving a delicious range of Italian bitters and vermouth-based cocktails that lubricate appetites for the fresh pasta dishes and other modern Italian eats on the menu. Naturally, a few Da Paolo classics like Paolo’s spicy lobster tagliolini and mushroom truffle risotto are on it too.\n“As a company, we’d always wanted to have something in Dempsey. (The enclave) has such a unique environment – it’s very green and you have these old buildings with lots of space and volume,” said Guillaume. “The stars really aligned in terms of timing – where we were in our expertise and the location being available. We’ve been refining our concepts over the years and now we’ve brought them all together in a cocktail of experiences in one location.”\n“The worst thing is that you never switch off. Especially for Francesca and me. We go home, we’re in bed and we’re talking about work. It’s hard to separate.” – Guillaume Pichoir\n\n\nENJOYING THEIR LEGACY\nWith the attention that a new flagship of this scale demands, Paolo and Judie can be spotted in the premises often, keeping an eye on Francesca’s and Guillaume’s young sons Malo, 7, and Arno, 5; greeting familiar customers and introducing them to the new space. “We’re just here to help out because this is a much bigger concept and I have experience with all the sections,” said Paolo.\n“This restaurant is something we are really proud of – of what my children and son-in-law have created,” Judie added. “It hasn’t been easy, but they have grown from strength to strength, and learned from their mistakes and experiences. (Paolo and I) are just so grateful.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     food ', '     Restaurants ', '     Singapore ', '     Family ', '     Profiles ', '     Chefs ']}"

      NUS study finds pig DNA in cuttlefish and prawn balls sold in Singapore
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The genetic material of pigs was found in one brand of cuttlefish and prawn balls sold in Singapore, research\xa0from the National University of Singapore has\xa0found.\nIn a study published on Thursday (Oct 31), the researchers from NUS\' Department of Biological Sciences reported that pig DNA was detected in samples from a seafood brand, which was not named by them.\nWhile they initially suspected lab\xa0contamination,\xa0the ""same seafood brand repeatedly yielded pig DNA in five samples which were bought at different times and places"", the study said.\nThis could be the ""most serious case of mislabelling"" for a multi-religious society like Singapore among the instances they found from the testing of\xa0105 samples of fresh and frozen seafood from six\xa0supermarkets and two\xa0seafood restaurants in Singapore.\n""Fortunately, the samples were not labelled as halal or kosher, but such cases do highlight the need for regular testing of heavily processed, multi-species seafood samples,"" researchers said.\nThey also found that\xa0all samples of processed seafood labelled as containing crustaceans -\xa0that is crab, prawn and/or\xa0lobster -\xa0yielded only fish DNA.\xa0In contrast, cuttlefish balls tested were indeed made of cuttlefish.\n“We were unable to find any crustacean DNA in all eight samples. Fish DNA was abundant and we suspect that overall, many of these products do not include any or have only minuscule amounts of crustacean tissues.""\nOther examples of mislabelling highlighted include substituting\xa0arrowtooth flounder for\xa0halibut, chum salmon for wild-caught Atlantic\xa0salmon and one sample of capelin roe being sold as prawn roe.\n""Such fraud is particularly common for fillets and heavily processed seafood products because they are not readily identifiable by eye,"" said researchers.\n""CREATIVE LABELLING""\nHowever, the researchers added that the level of clear-cut mislabelling in Singapore is not high in comparison with other countries in region.\nStudies from Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam had found levels of mislabelling to be at around 60 per cent.\nThe main problem in Singapore is ""creative labelling""\xa0especially for heavily processed products, they argued.\nThis is probably due to the lack of clear regulations in the Sale of Food Act.\xa0The law states that labels need to provide a name or description which is “sufficient to indicate the true nature of the food”.\nFish is defined as any aquatic organism commonly consumed by humans, which excludes mammals but includes crustaceans and molluscs.\n""This state of affairs is no longer in line with the expectations of today’s consumers who expect labels to be precise,"" the researchers said.\nThey suggested a\xa0regulatory update may be needed, benchmarked against rules set by the European Union (EU).\nThe EU mandates that both the commercial and scientific name of the product should be listed on its label.

      Meat-lovers guide: Where to indulge in the best dry-aged beef in Singapore
  </h1>, 'text': ""There are scarce instances where age and dehydration improve flesh. In fact, we can think of only one: Dry-aging. Of beef, that is. The process of leaving hunks of beef out to dry in a temperature- and humidity-controlled room is as time-honoured as pickling and canning. It was how beef was prepared before modern food hygiene rules and business interests gave rise to wet-ageing, where beef is vacuum-sealed in a bag and left to mature before sale.\nAll fresh beef is aged for a least a few days to allow its enzymes to break down the muscle tissue, resulting in improved texture and flavour. Wet-aged beef ages faster, which means meat gets to the market quicker. It also retains more water weight – and heavier meat equals bigger profits.\nDry-aging is a costlier endeavour. It produces a lesser yield compared to wet-aging as the moisture loss results in shrinkage as the beef ages. By the time the meat is fully dry-aged, up to 60 percent of it is lost.\nDry-aging is essentially controlled decomposition, said executive director of Huber’s Butchery Andre Huber. “Before a cut of dry-aged beef can be used for cooking, the rotten crust that forms around the surface of the meat must be carved out,” he explained – which further lessens the yield.\n\n\nA post shared by Huber's Butchery (@hubersbutchery)\n\n\nA MATTER OF CHEMISTRY\nPeek into a dry-aging cabinet and you’ll see much of the meat covered in a creamy, yellowish mould. While that doesn’t make for an alluring image, the aroma in these facilities is surprisingly appealing, like a subtle mix of cheese, sage, earth and blood. All this is proof that some delicious chemistry is at play.\nLike curing pork for ham, dry-aging beef is as simple as letting the meat hang out to dry and allowing time and microbes to work their magic. Over time, the meat’s enzymes work themselves free, breaking proteins down into amino acids, which in turn deepens the flavour of the meat.\nAs inherent carbohydrates slowly turn into sugars, they weaken the connective tissue around the protein strands so that the meat becomes more tender and sweet. Meanwhile, as the water inside the meat works its way out, the meat begins to shrink and its flavours begin to concentrate.\nWhile most restaurants and butchers say that they dry-age their beef for between 30 and 45 days, there really isn’t a precise formula. It all depends on the type and size of the meat, and the flavour you want to achieve. Fattier beef, for example, can require a longer aging before the effects are noticeable.\nAt Huber’s Butchery’s factory in Pandan Loop, dry-aging is done in a slow, controlled process. “We take about 60 days to age what others would usually do in 28 days because we think (the slower process) is safer and yields beef with better flavour and texture,” said Huber. The company has a customised dry-aging programme that allows customers to order various cuts of meat, including a whole prime rib that typically weighs between seven and 12kg, and dictate how long they would like it to be dry-aged for.\n“Most importantly, you have to start with a good quality product,” said Huber. “You need meat that has a higher fat content in terms of marbling so that it will keep sufficiently moist even after the dry-aging process.”\nNaturally, the longer the beef is dry-aged, the more intense and pronounced its flavours. Ask most chefs and they will tell you that dry-aged beef tastes nuttier, “musky”, “like mushrooms”, or “like blue cheese”. Most restaurants say they sell beef that is aged up to 45 days because any longer and the flavour becomes too pungent for diners to appreciate.\n“We take about 60 days to age what others would usually do in 28 days because we think (the slower process) is safer and yields beef with better flavour and texture.” – Andre Huber\n\n\nWHO’S GOT THE BEEF?\nThose yet to experience the joys of a fine dry-aged steak should hotfoot it to The Black Swan where chef Alysia Chan serves a Vintage Beef Porterhouse MBS 3+ (S$152 for 800g). Made from 60-month-old breeding cattle that are turned out to pasture for retirement, the beef is dry-aged for 30 days to enrich its intrinsically deep flavours before it is deftly grilled and served with the options of nduja butter, chimichurri, lobster bearnaise (our recommendation), green peppercorn or truffle butter sauces.\nOpus Bar & Grill at Hilton Singapore has its own Himalayan salt-lined aging cabinet, which offers the added benefit of reducing humidity, deterring bacterial growth and infusing the meat with a whisper of salt. The restaurant serves a 14-to-36-day dry-aged Australian Rangers Valley Angus OP ribeye for S$110.\nSkirt at W Hotel introduced the first salt-lined dry-aging cabinet in Singapore when it opened in 2012. It serves an 800g dry-aged Aberdeen Angus T-bone steak for S$120 and a 1.2kg dry aged Red Poll cote de beouf for S$228, with bone marrow and watercress.\nAt the Singapore outpost of New York’s Wolfgang Steakhouse, sub-primal cuts of USDA Black Angus beef are dry-aged for 28 days before an in-house butcher carves the meat to size for cooking. These are grilled to order at a searing 870ºC, giving them a beautifully blistered crust that gives way to succulent, deeply flavoured meat within.\nAustralian Black Angus beef fills the dry-aging fridge at Ginett Restaurant & Wine Bar where executive chef Sylvain Royer ages the meat for between four to six weeks before grilling them over a charcoal oven. Ginett’s dry-aged specials start from S$46 for a 250g Australian Black Angus MB3+ striploin.\nSince its inception 11 years ago, Bedrock Bar & Grill has been serving excellent dry-aged cuts like the USDA Prime ribeye (S$108 for 300 grams) and Irish grass-fed ribeye (S$98 for 300g). The latter has a particularly earthy flavour not only from the dry-aging but as a result of the cattle’s grass feed.\nFinally, at Culina, diners can buy dry-aged Margaret River Angus Bone-in Beef Striploin and Black Onyx Angus Beef OP Ribs MBS3+ to cook at home exactly the way they like it. Alternatively, the bistro chefs will happily cook it for you for a S$15 to S$25 service fee and serve it a selection of sauces including bearnaise, Bordelaise, pepper, horseradish cream or chimichurri.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     food ', '     gastronomy ', '     Singapore ', '     Fine dining ', '     Restaurants ']}"

      Extreme eating in Jakarta: Kambing soup with brains, eyes and ears finds new fans in the age of social media
  </h1>, 'text': 'JAKARTA: As soon as a group of customers walked in, Mr Boy Alfian, 55, swiftly lifted a\xa0piece of red cloth covering two large metal bowls\xa0at his open-air stall in South Jakarta.\nInside one bowl were small cuts of pre-cooked goat meat, tripe and liver, popular among the majority of the customers. \xa0\nBut those who are more adventurous and intrepid,\xa0as well as regulars who have developed the taste, make a beeline for the second bowl. It contained parts of the animal that many might find off-putting, such as goat eyes, ears, brains and\xa0sometimes, the coveted goat testicles.\nThis\xa0stall\xa0is known for serving an authentic Jakartan dish called\xa0“sop kaki kambing”.\nWhile the name is translated as goat\xa0leg soup, the countless street-side vendors, shops and restaurants selling the dish across the Indonesian capital offer all parts of the animal.\nMr Alfian explained that the name of the dish is derived from stewing the goat\xa0legs (hoof and all) as the soup stock.\n“The legs are the most active part of a goat. That’s why the legs pack a lot of flavours,” he told CNA. \xa0\nThe legs are braised for three to five hours in a pot filled with water and coconut milk, or full cream milk in some restaurants.\nOnce the legs are fully cooked, herbs and spices like lemongrass, ginger, turmeric and galangal are added into the soup.\xa0The result is a rich and creamy broth, accented by the tangy flavour of freshly sliced tomato.\nThose who prefer an extra creamy soup can add clarified butter to their taste. Some prefer to stir the butter into the broth, while most simply let the butter melt by the warmth of the soup.\nMr Alfian said Mr Irwan, the stall’s owner, insists\xa0on only using goats\xa0below nine months old.\n“Older goats would have tougher meat and the flavour is too gamey and strong for many people.\n“The younger goats are also healthier. But of course, the younger the goats, the more expensive their meat gets,” Mr Alfian explained.\nAnd this is the secret of Sop Kaki Kambing Irwan, which has thrived in the busy Melawai area of South Jakarta since it first opened in 1969.\nFifty years later, the humble food stall has amassed a steady stream of regulars, including ministers and celebrities. They mostly come after dark, slurping the creamy, comforting soup in the chilly night.\xa0\n\n\nAPPRECIATION FOR ANIMAL ORGANS \nThe culture of eating animal organs dates\xa0back to the Dutch colonial era, when Indonesia was known as the Dutch East Indies and Jakarta was called Batavia.\nBack then, the natives could only afford to eat what their masters would not.\nAnd today, animal\xa0organs continue to appeal to local foodies. \xa0\n“I’ve had customers ordering a bowl of nothing but eyes,” Mr Alfian shared.\xa0“People,\xa0young and old, appreciate the taste of the organs and some become fast fans. You can find liver or brain in some other dishes in Indonesia, but never eye or ear.” \xa0 \xa0\xa0\nMr Alfian professed that younger goat’s organs taste better. “Older organs taste bitterer. They can be a lot tougher too.”\nThe eyeball, after hours of stewing, has lost its baleful stare. It is\xa0protected by an outer shell, but inside, the gelatinous, almost fat-like substance has a melt-in-the-mouth consistency.\nThe goat’s outer ear is tough and chewy, while the ear canal soft and squishy.\nAs for the brain, its mushy and spongy texture is reminiscent of a runny pudding. It is bitter and pungent, an acquired taste indeed.\n\n\nDuring CNA’s visit, the goat’s testicles, which are colloquially called the “torpedo” in Indonesia, were not available at Sop Kaki Kambing Irwan.\n“We struggle to find a male goat. Goat breeders wouldn’t typically slay a male goat as young as we would have liked, preferring to let it mature to impregnate the does,” he said.\nAnother sop kaki kambing stall at the edge of the parking lot of an East Jakarta traditional market shed light on why it is not\xa0selling goat testicles,\xa0once believed to be an aphrodisiac.\n“People are becoming more educated now. They stopped believing that the torpedo is good for their sex life,” the vendor, Mr Bona Darius told CNA inside his canvas tent stall.\n“At least here in\xa0my shop, people simply don’t look for torpedoes any more. Less and less vendors are selling torpedoes,” he added.\nAn air-conditioned restaurant in South Jakarta, which is part of a growing sop kaki kambing food chain, also did not have goat testicles in their menu.\n“Torpedoes are becoming rarer and rarer these days. So are people who come and look for them,” said the restaurant’s cook, Mr Elvian Nur Rahman.\nKAMBING SOUP GAINING POPULARITY \nThe plethora of Indonesian and international food bloggers and vloggers challenging each other to savour the goat\xa0organs has only increased the popularity of the soup.\nThis has piqued the interests of many and\xa0secured the dish’s spot on the culinary map of Indonesia.\nA foodie duo\xa0who chronicled their gastronomic adventures on Instagram account Eatandcouple, gave the soup a try in June.\xa0Their video has been viewed more than 140,000 times.\n“I’ll have one mixed bowl. Make sure it has all the head organs,” the man, known as Mr Oliver,\xa0told a sop kaki kambing seller.\n“They put an eye in there. Wow, that’s quite extreme.”\nThere are also people who would only try the organs once, just so to earn bragging rights for having tasted the unusual food.\n“I had the eye once out of curiosity, but the idea of putting an animal’s organ into my mouth scares me,” said Ms Lestari Suwondo at Sop Kaki Kambing Irwan over a bowl of goat meat and trotters.\n“The taste (of the eye) is quite okay as long you don’t think too much about what you are actually eating,” she added.\nAnd then of course there are those who would prefer to stick to the ordinary choices. Mr Bondan Pratama, for one, said he would never try the organs.\n“No thanks. Not even if you pay me to,” he said, shaking his head, as he devoured his bowl of goat\xa0meat and tripe.\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     Indonesia ', '     Jakarta ', '     food ']}"

      The fight to save Bangkok’s affordable and iconic street food
  </h1>, 'text': 'BANGKOK: Shortly after the Thai military staged a coup in 2014, it made an announcement that would forever change the face of Bangkok and one of its icons - street food.\xa0\nVendors on the city’s sidewalks were told they had to move away or relocate to temporarily designated zones. The ban was part of the government’s wider effort to return order to the capital city, known for its affordable and tasty street food like Phad Thai noodles, papaya salad, and mango with sticky rice.\xa0\nSince the military took power, the rule has been gradually implemented across Bangkok, including Sukhumvit 55 Road.\xa0\nCommonly known as Thonglor, the 2.4km road runs through one of Bangkok’s most expensive neighbourhoods. It boasts a mix of eating options, including fine-dining restaurants, fancy bars and cafes. Previously, a variety of street food stalls was also part of the mix, where passers-by could grab plastic chairs and enjoy decent meals at affordable prices.\xa0\nNot anymore.\n“My staff started complaining about having nothing to eat in 2017,” said\xa0Chris Foo, 38, who owns a business in the area.\n“They said the food they usually ate had been kicked out of the streets. So my team brainstormed and we thought opening a restaurant where they can eat at cost would be a great option,” he said.\nHalf British, half Chinese, Foo has spent the past 36 years in Bangkok. He loves street food as much as any Thai and grew to know many small vendors on the street, where his company has operated for 12 years.\xa0\nAfter discussing it with his staff, Foo decided to open a small noodle shop near his office so some 100 employees of his could eat at cost and everybody else could eat at affordable prices. But shortly before the opening, he had an unexpected visitor who made a surprise offer -\xa0 a land-owner who lives just across the street from his firm.\nNearly two years later, a modern-looking building rose next to an old bridge by a black canal on the less developed end of Thonglor. It is called Saphan 55 - or Bridge 55 in English. For local residents, the venue is a new landmark that looks like a cool warehouse from the outside and an old Thai wooden house from within.\xa0\nFor Foo, it is a street food shelter where good local dishes are available at affordable prices and small vendors are welcome.\xa0\nThe venue\xa0had a soft launch about a month ago but it has already welcomed many customers, particularly at lunchtime. Here, a bowl of noodles costs US$1.50, bottled water is US$0.20 and a cup of coffee starts from USS$1. The same items are normally double the price in ordinary restaurants nearby.\n“Downstairs is pretty much a street food shelter - a charity. Upstairs is a Thai restaurant called Baan Saphan, which sells 150-180 Baht (US$5-6) dishes. The reason why we have the upstairs is because upstairs supports downstairs,” he said.\nFor now, sellers in the shelter are not paying rent. Each month, they only have to pay the power and water bills. In the future, however, Foo plans to charge them a small fee for rent.\xa0\n“We want to give them a chance to build up because they don’t have savings. We also have to make it sustainable,” he told CNA. His team is in the process of bringing back street food vendors to Thonglor. Only this time, they can operate legally and comfortably at a well-equipped site specifically designed for them.\n“I’m quite familiar with everybody down here. They had already left the street and I’m bringing some of them back,” Foo\xa0said. In front of him, people get on and off boat taxis and buses. A few metres away, office workers and sellers do their grocery shopping at an evening fresh market.\xa0\n""This side of Thonglor is dead. There’s nothing down here. So for the fresh market and everyone around here, this is only going to bring more for them. It’s going to benefit everyone’s livelihoods. People will be able to find things to eat at affordable prices."" he added.\nBANGKOK WITHOUT STREET FOOD\nBy the end of this year, most of Bangkok’s roads and pavements will be free from street food. The space will be returned to pedestrians and motorists as the Thai government tries to restore hygiene and order to the city’s streets and walkways.\xa0\nSo far, the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration has cleared 508 areas in the capital from street vendors. It plans to do the same to the remaining 175 locations in the next few months.\xa0\nWhile the efforts to manage Bangkok’s streets are welcomed by many residents, the ban on street vendors has badly affected others. A number of small sellers were forced to stop their businesses altogether because they had nowhere to continue.\nOne of them is Lakkana Inket, 61. She sold soy milk in Bangkok for 21 years. The small business had made it easier for a single mother like her to pay a mortgage and her two children’s student loans. Every day, the widow would set up her stall at 5am on the pavement of Taweewattana district and be gone by 9.30am.\xa0\nIn 2015, the district began clearing its roads and pavements from street vendors. Like other food sellers in the area, Lakkana was told to leave.\n“They want to make us extinct. They’ve never provided us with any alternative location or assistance. They have no mercy,” she said.\nThe authorities see us as social garbage.\nAccording to the Network of Thai Street Vendors for Sustainable Development, the ban on street sellers has affected some 200,000 operators across the city and hurt the local economy. Its president Raywat Chobtham told CNA that tens of thousands of low-income earners who rely on the businesses will not be able to survive because there are not enough state-owned sites to accommodate them in expensive commercial districts.\n“There are so many street vendors. They don’t have much income and live hand to mouth. We can’t force the private sector to charge a low rental fee either, while the government’s locations aren’t good because they’re far away,” he said.\n“For customers like office workers, for instance, you have to be there. If you move, customers have to travel to you and they may not get to work in time. Sellers are willing to move as long as they can continue the business and have customers.”\xa0\nRenting a little spot in central Bangkok now costs about 500 Baht (US$16) per day, according to Raywat, while the average daily earnings for street vendors are less than 1,000 Baht (US$33). Besides the rental fee, they also have to pay for transport, food, their children’s tuition fee and products they want to sell.\nFor Raywat, the only solution is for everyone to compromise. He believes the government should provide commercially strategic locations for street vendors to continue their businesses.\n“You can’t just chase them away to somewhere they can’t sell. If the pavement is 3m wide, for instance, vendors should be allowed to occupy 1m and leave the rest for pedestrians. But if it’s narrow, then don’t allow them to obstruct the traffic,” he said.\n“The government has to manage it in a way that allows sellers to continue their job. We need to keep fighting.”\nOn Sep 11, Jirawat Pangma from the City Hall’s Law Enforcement Department said authorities are in the process of closing down the remaining 175 locations in Bangkok currently occupied by street vendors. However, City Hall will relocate some affected sellers to markets nearby and carry out the plan gradually to minimise the impact on vendors and the public.\nFor now, Foo’s privately-run hawker centre is providing rare security for those with few other options.\n“Many customers come here for lunch. It’s comfortable and clean and this street is full of pedestrians. Although we sell food at 45-50 Baht (US$1.50-1.70), we always use fresh ingredients. Without street food, this is another option for people around here,” said one of the food sellers at Saphan 55, Monthira Takam.\xa0\nAnd for customers, cheap street food is back on the lunch menu.\n“The price isn’t so expensive here,” said office worker Athiwat Thanapongworapa. “Street food is good and iconic but it should be organised and properly designated.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     Bangkok ', '     Thailand ', '     food ']}"

      Bangkok’s best street food: From oyster omelettes to crispy pork noodles
  </h1>, 'text': ""Bangkok’s reputation as one of the world’s most incredible culinary destinations is largely founded on its options for hawker food.\nStreet chefs produce a fantastic array of Thai food classics, whipping up everything from Chinese-inspired stir-fries to spicy salads, pungent curries and grilled meats.\nAt popular stalls, the chatter of excitable conversation is only occasionally drowned out by the sound of loud, satisfied slurps.\nIt’s little wonder, then, that the Thai capital is often cited as the planet’s street food Mecca. Therefore, investigating the cornucopia of fantastic banquets to be sampled curb-side is an integral part of the Bangkok dining experience.\nSome visitors are squeamish about the hygiene standards at these venues. They needn’t be. Any hawker stall worth its nam pla prik (fish sauce infused with blindingly hot bird’s eye chilis) will have freshly cooked food.\nLook out for long lines of local diners and you’ll know that you are onto a good thing.\n\n\nPAD THAI SALADAENG\nSPECIALITY DISH: PAD THAI (STIR-FRIED RICE NOODLES)\nWhen it comes to pad thai, there are few better options than this underrated gem – often overshadowed by the more famous Thip Samai in the old city.\nFrom her makeshift kitchen in the front yard of an old Thai villa, Pranee Thanee doles out giant portions of the stir-fried rice noodle dish, which typically includes eggs, tofu, dried shrimp, tamarind along with a slew of other components.\nDespite its status as one of Thailand’s signature street food classics, pad thai can be a tricky thing to get right. Even aficionados would agree that many vendors in Bangkok either overdo the sugar or scrimp on ingredients.\nThankfully there are no such issues here. Pranee is especially proud of her homemade tamarind sauce, which she concocts at the weekend (the stall is open Monday to Friday) by simmering tamarind, sugar and salt for hours.\nFor THB50 (S$2.25), you’ll be presented with a plate of beautifully silken sauce-coated noodles brimming with goodies. Especially abundant is a pad thai goong (pad thai with shrimp), which is packed with plump, juicy crustaceans.\n47 Sala Daeng Soi 2 (behind Silom Complex), Bangkok. Open daily from 7am to 2.30pm\n\n\nSOM TAM JAY SO\nSPECIALITY DISH: SOM TAM (SPICY PAPAYA SALAD)\nWhile Jay Fai’s runaway success has made her the doyen of Bangkok’s street food cooks, she isn’t the only goggle-wearing matriarch cooking up a storm on the sois.\nAt Som Tam Jay So, the presiding chef, easily identified by her distinctive eyewear, pounds out the makings of som tam (spicy papaya salad), one of Thailand's most loved dishes.\nWith her goggles protecting her from the potent splashback, she hammers together the essential components of the dish: Shredded fruit, garlic, fish sauce and lots and lots of chilli.\nWhile the array of different som tam versions are all essential – try the som tam sua (papaya salad with thin rice noodles and crab) – there are plenty of other highlights. A gargantuan barbecue produces beautifully smoky chicken wings. Other classics from northeast Thailand such as fluffy fried catfish and kaw moo yang (grilled pork neck) are also present and correct.\nSoi Phiphat 2, Silom, Bangkok\xa0\n\n\nNAY MONG\nSPECIALITY DISH: HOY THOD (OYSTER OMELETTE)\nThere are countless contenders for the crown of Thailand’s favourite comfort food. Some opt for kao ka moo (stewed pork leg on rice), others err towards the warming qualities of a bowl of jok (Thai-style rice congee).\nAnother dish that rarely fails to hit the spot is hoy thod (oyster omelette), a gooey, decadent thing of beautiful simplicity that is as addictive as it is unhealthy.\nOf all the vendors specialising in the dish, few are better known than Nay Mong. One of the most renowned stalls in the city's Chinatown – no mean feat considering the competition in the area – Khun Mong has been serving up his greasy treats for over 30 years.\nUnsurprisingly, given all that experience, his team have got the dish down to a fine art. Grab a pew on the street, choose your style of omelette – awlua (crispy) or awsuan (gooey) – and take your pick between the plump, juicy oysters or mussels (or have both) then ascend towards street food heaven.\n39 Thanon\xa0Phlap Phla Chai, Bombrab Sathupai, Bangkok\nMAE VAREE\nSPECIALITY DISH: MANGO STICKY RICE\nChange is inevitable in a city as dynamic and fast-moving as Bangkok. And such is the case with Mae Varee, which has undergone something of an upgrade in recent times.\nAlthough it is still one of the city’s go-to venues for mango sticky rice (take-away only), the fruit is no longer presented in haphazard piles stacked in front of a beat-up old store.\nInstead, customers pick their juicy, sweet poison from photogenic, bright wooden baskets and pay at the counter inside the newly-refurbished shop.\nIt’s a little less characterful for sure, but thankfully there’s been no tinkering with a dessert recipe that has had crowds flocking here for the last 35-years.\nGood mango sticky rice is all about the ingredients and the ones utilised by owner Varee Jennsuwan are exemplary. Nam Dok Mai or golden mangoes are paired with rice from the northern province of Chiang Mai and a salty-sweet cream topping made with coconuts from Surat Thani in the south. It’s a combination that unites the disparate parts of the nation in deliciousness.\n1 Soi Thong Lo, Sukhumvit 55, Bangkok\xa0\n\n\nGUAY JUB MR JOE\nSPECIALITY DISH: GUAY JUB (ROLLED RICE NOODLES WITH CRISPY PORK)\nGastronomic pilgrims come from all over Bangkok to worship at Mr Joe. It’s not the guay jub that they are here for though, although there’s no doubting the beautifully-balanced, peppery qualities of the broth.\nNo, the star attraction at this little venue tucked away in the depths of Sathorn is its moo krob (crispy pork). The version here features crisp skin surrounding rich layers of soft pork.\nPar for the course for any good vendor you might think? But the golden crown on top of every slice of salty, yielding pork belly is so deliciously crunchy that it’s almost miraculous. Indeed, it’s not uncommon to see even the supplest of customers give in to their primal urges and make repeat orders.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Bangkok ', '     Thailand ', '     Travel ', '     food ', '     gastronomy ']}"

      How a ‘worm’ might affect prices of cereal, toothpaste and chicken rice
  </h1>, 'text': ""NAKHON RATCHASIMA, Thailand: It is an insect species almost no one in Singapore has heard of, and it grows to no longer than two inches.\nBut the fall armyworm is one hungry caterpillar that has devastated cornfields across Asia in a short time, threatening an agricultural disaster.\nCorn is found in many things, including animal feed. So a corn shortage could mean higher prices of cereal, toothpaste, chicken and more.\nIn Thailand, the fall armyworm was first reported last year. And it has since spread to at least 50 of the 77 provinces — nearly two-thirds of the country.\n“This pest isn’t native to Asia. So when it arrived in Asia, the farmers were caught unaware. They didn’t know what to do. So there was panic,” said Corteva Agriscience zonal biology leader (Asia-Pacific) Pampapathy Gurulingappa.\n“The pest is so damaging it can eat all stages of the corn.”\nTo combat this armyworm, his company has deployed hundreds of agricultural experts across Asia, which is responsible for almost a third of the world’s corn supply.\nThe programme For Food’s Sake! finds out whether there is any way to stop this pest from causing more damage. (Watch the episode here.)\nSTRONG FLYERS, HUGE APPETITES\nThis crop devourer is the larvae of the fall armyworm moth. And in three years, it has devoured as much as US$3 billion (S$4.09 billion) worth of crops in Africa.\nIt got its name because it invades croplands en masse, like an army. And it is moving fast.\nWithin a year of being spotted in India — in July last year — this armyworm native to the Americas has spread to Sri Lanka, China and many parts of Southeast Asia, such as Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand.\nThe adult moths are strong flyers, generally covering more than 400 kilometres in one crop season. “They can fly about 100 km in a single night assisted by winds,” said Dr Gurulingappa. “That’s why they’re able to spread very fast.”\nThese pests also seem to thrive and reproduce faster in tropical regions, with the high humidity and temperatures. “The adults can lay, on average, around 1,600 eggs,” he added.\n“In each of the egg masses, sometimes there’ll be 100 to 200 eggs. So you can imagine how fast the fall armyworm can spread.”\nSince it was discovered in Thailand, the country’s leading maize research institute — Kasetsart University’s National Corn and Sorghum Research Centre — has been studying the fall armyworm.\nOne of the entomologists, Ms Sangkhae Nawanich, said not only can the armyworm cause damage at every stage of the corn, but it also can eat more than 80 varieties of crops, including rice, cabbage and fruits.\nIn the province of Nakhon Ratchasima, farmer Daeng Phumkokrak grumbled that for the first time in his 40 years of farming, his 40-day-old corn crop may not survive until harvest. Typically, his yield is around 15,000 kilogrammes of corn.\n“(The armyworm) eats the crop from the top to the stem,” he said. “It affects about 90 per cent of the crops.”\nOne corn farmer said he has come across other pests before but never so many that can cause such damage. Another farmer added: “I’ve already used insecticide on some crops, but it isn’t working. I’ve no idea what to do.”\nCOSTLY IMPLICATIONS\nAs many of the countries in the region are affected, “that’s immediately causing a supply disruption in corn, so that might increase the price”, pointed out Singapore Management University assistant professor of finance Aurobindo Ghosh.\nAnd with corn being an important source of poultry feed, a dish like chicken rice may end up more expensive as the cost of chicken production goes up in future.\nThere might be “some substitutes” for corn, but perhaps at a higher cost, said Dr Ghosh. “So the best defence here is to try and prevent the pests from proliferating any more.”\nTo this end, Corteva Agriscience is teaching farmers how to manage the pest, although “it’s very difficult”, admitted Dr Gurulingappa, because the armyworm burrows deep inside the whorls of leaves and feeds from there.\nBut there can be more effective control if insecticide is applied the right way to reach the pest, he said.\nAs a potential solution, the company has also tested seed treatments to protect corn in its early stages, while other experts recommend introducing the armyworm’s natural enemies, such as ants, fungi or even a strain of virus.\nFor now, because the United States is the world’s top corn producer and exporter — with some soya bean farmers also switching to corn following Chinese tariffs on US soya beans — global supply remains unaffected.\nBut for how long? As Dr Gurulingappa warned, “The fall armyworm is here to stay (in Asia) and cause significant damage.”\nWatch this episode of For Food's Sake! here.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     consumer ', '     food ', '     CNA Insider ']}"

      What's making pork more expensive? There's a fatty belly factor
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: Sio bak (roast pork belly) is one of the fattiest cuts of meat — seemingly decadent but hardly unwanted. And demand for it has indirectly driven up pork prices, in Singapore and worldwide.\n“The demand has increased, pork belly prices have increased, and what happens is that you can’t just keep selling pork belly — you have to basically sell all the cuts in the carcass,” said Huber’s Butchery executive director Andre Huber.\n“Naturally, that cut has to increase (in price) to control the demand because there’s only a limited supply.”\nJust last year, pork fat was reported as one of the world’s top 10 most nutritious foods, as ranked by scientists.\n“The Europeans, the Americans … are also now starting to consume a lot (of pork belly),” added Huber, whose butcher shop is the largest in Singapore, supplying meat to almost 1,000 restaurants and hotels.\n“So if demand from the world is increasing for this particular cut, then yes, I see the price (of pork belly) really starting to go up more and more.”\nIn Singapore, the average retail prices of chilled pork have increased steadily over the past decade: By 11 per cent for lean pork, 15 per cent for pork ribs and more than 20 per cent for pork belly.\nThe programme For Food’s Sake! examines the factors, which include consumer preferences. (Watch this episode here.)\n‘EVERYTHING ADDS UP’\nPork is Singapore’s second favourite meat after chicken; more than 126,000 tonnes of pork were imported last year.\nThe bulk of the fresh chilled pork comes from Indonesia, Australia and East Malaysia, while the frozen pork and other pork products are from countries such as Brazil, the Netherlands, Spain and the United States.\nWATCH: Where Singapore's pork comes from (Dur 3:11)\n“Over the last 10 years, (feed prices) have increased by 40, 50 per cent. Bad weather or drought would affect prices badly, which is happening all the time,” said the veterinarian by training.\nTransportation costs, which make up around 10 per cent of each pig’s selling price, have also gone up.\n“Oil prices, in the last few years, haven’t been very good,” cited Ng, who rears around 65,000 pigs on his farm. “If you look at building a ship … the prices (of iron ore and other metals) have also increased.\nEverything adds up, so we have no choice — everything has to go (up).\nAt importer OJJ Foods, which is responsible for almost a third of the chilled pork entering Singapore, the cost of labour — a big component of its overheads — has also inched up over the years.\nThe company processes and distributes both chilled and frozen pork, supplying the meat to major supermarkets here. Automation helps, but there is “not a lot of buffer”.\n“We can’t say, ‘Just increase prices.’ But … if the raw material prices were to increase significantly —10, 15 per cent — we have to pass on (the increase) to the customer,” said OJJ Foods managing director Ting Puong Huat.\nIS MORE FOR LESS POSSIBLE?\nSupermarkets typically sell frozen pork belly now for about S$10 per kilogramme and chilled pork belly for S$14.50/kg.\nAlthough chilled pork costs close to 50 per cent more, most of the consumers this programme interviewed choose to pay more for it because they believe it has better taste and texture compared with frozen pork.\nBut is that true? To find out, programme host Ming Tan roasted a fresh piece of pork belly and a frozen piece, and asked people whether they could discern a difference in flavour and texture.\nSome of them could not, while others even preferred the frozen pork.\nProfessor William Chen, the director of Nanyang Technological University’s Food Science and Technology Programme, was also able to do a test using a texture analyser, which can be done for any food product.\nHe tested two samples of roast, one made from fresh chilled pork and the other, frozen pork. The analysis showed that the frozen pork was tenderer.\nIn addition, the scientist said nutrition is preserved better with the fast freezing of the pork, whereas fresh pork is more susceptible to bacteria contamination when put in storage and transported.\n“When we immediately freeze (pork), all the nutrient value would be preserved. So it’s safer in a sense, and it’s cheaper than fresh pork,” he said.\nAnd that goes for pork belly too.\nWatch this episode of For Food's Sake! here.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     consumer ', '     food ', '     CNA Insider ']}"

      Foodie alert: Fancy dining in a few Michelin-starred restaurants at one go? 
  </h1>, 'text': 'My hands were trembling as I pinched the folds of the raviolis I had earlier stuffed with lobster and ginger.\xa0 You would be too, if your teacher was Erlantz Gorostiza, head chef of two Michelin-starred M.B. restaurant at The Ritz-Carlton, Abama in Spain. And if you were told – quite seriously – that the pasta was going onto a paying guest’s plate that night.\nWhen Gorostiza suddenly asked if I wanted to try making ravioli after our interview, I didn’t have to think twice. Good thing it was way before that night’s dinner service. At the snail’s pace I was going, nobody would have gotten their carb fix.\nGorostiza was in Kyoto last month to do a four-hands dinner with Katsuhito Inoue, Executive Italian Chef of The Ritz-Carlton, Kyoto’s La Locanda.\xa0 It was the second stop of The Ritz-Carlton Stellar Dining Series, which began at The Ritz-Carlton, Tokyo earlier in the month and will end in Guangzhou this Sunday (Oct 13). This is the series’ second year, after last year’s inaugural launch that traversed Singapore, Osaka, Hong Kong and Beijing.\n""The Stellar Dining Series is a good opportunity for sommeliers, mixologists and restaurant chefs to travel across continents to share their expertise,” Ranim Ben Romdhane, Marriott International’s Senior\xa0Director of Restaurants & Bar, Asia Pacific, told CNA Luxury.\n“Guests get to discover the food and beverage menus at the different properties in one place and the team can share their passion with a wider audience.”\n\n\nON THE GOURMET TRAIL\nThe cities were chosen based on the presence of a Michelin Guide as well as their reputation as gourmet destinations. “For example, Guangzhou is known as the food capital of China, and the original birthplace of Cantonese cuisine. So we thought it\'d be very meaningful to bring it to Guangzhou this year,"" Romdhane shared.\nBesides gourmet meals and eat-your-heart-out afternoon teas, there are also activities such as pastry and cocktail master classes. Marriott Bonvoy members could also bid for exclusive experiences ranging from dine-and-stay packages to a guided fish market visit and a sushi-and-sake lunch.\nAmong the guests who came for the series was 31-year-old Davies Zheng from Shanghai, an Ambassador Elite and Lifetime Gold Marriott Bonvoy member who has stayed in a whopping 49 Ritz-Carlton hotels. After attending last year’s series, he was back for this year’s Kyoto and Guangzhou events.\nHe said, “The Dining Series allows me to try the cooking of different chefs all in one place. Some Michelin-starred restaurants are also hard to book and fly to, so it’s a good opportunity to try them all here.” And with activities such as daily complimentary cycling tours and exclusive visits to the Myokaku-ji Temple in Kyoto, Zheng found plenty to do besides eating.\nDespite Gorostiza and Inoue’s vastly different cultural backgrounds, the deep respect between both was evident in the eight-course, four-hands meal, which alternated between dishes from Inoue and Gorostiza with a thoughtful balance of robust Basque flavours and fine Japanese techniques, all underscored by ingredients freshly bought from local markets that morning.\nThere were signatures such as Gorostiza’s Truffle Gelatin & Foie Gras Cream Sweet & Salty – moreish layers of foie gras cream and truffle gelatin topped with diced mango and quince – and modern twists like Inoue’s Caprese, a creamy dollop of tomato, basil and mozzarella on a spoon that was so well blended yet so distinct in the individual ingredient flavours.\nThe wines traipsed across countries such as Georgia, Japan, Germany and France, and were all perfect foils to their respective dishes. Under-the-radar gems included a biodynamic, vegan 2015 Querciabella Batar from Italy, that had an intense minerality with stone fruit notes that went beautifully with the Kinki Acqua Pazza, a Hokkaido snapper in a broth of reduced fish stock with parsley oil.\n\n\nMENUS FULL OF SURPRISES\nSpeaking to CNA Luxury, Gorostiza and Inoue shared that they had discussed what each wanted to bring to the table before deciding on a final menu that would “make sense to the guest with a lot of surprises”.\nGorostiza added: “It’s not just putting out one plate from each chef. They have to flow. I’ve a lot of respect for Japanese produce and the chefs. I learn a lot from their kitchen techniques and their way of life. They put their heart into the ingredients.”\nInoue himself was impressed that Gorostiza brought hardly any pre-prepared ingredients. Instead, almost everything was freshly prepared on-site. “He’s so energetic in the kitchen. I learn a lot from him.”\nThe second night’s Autumnal Tempura Dinner at the hotel’s one-Michelin starred Mizuki Tempura was a revelation of how refined tempura can be. Head chef Kenji Fujimoto, who has been helming the restaurant since the hotel’s opening in 2014, presented 14 dishes ranging from gingko nuts (I never knew this simple nut could be such a satisfying nibble in this form) and a crunchy Kurama prawn to melt-in-the mouth Kobe and Kyoto Hirai beef.\nThe dishes were paired with four Perrier-Jouet champagnes, including the limited-edition Belle Epoque Edition Autumn 2005 that was radiant in blush pink and delightful in its crisp and aromatic citrus bouquet. Already culinary zeniths in themselves, the meals ended on even higher notes with elegant Pierre Herme Paris pastries made by the brand’s appointed on-site patissier at The Ritz-Carlton, Kyoto, Regis Demanet.\nIn my six-person masterclass with head mixologists Oscar Mena and Yosuke Asano from The Ritz-Carlton, Hong Kong and Kyoto respectively, I met shy locals aspiring to be bartenders and a Malaysian and a Taiwanese living there who were cocktail fans.\nMena and Asano each demonstrated three cocktails inspired by the theme of the dining series – think Celestial Object, a tipple of Armagnac, umeshu plum liquor and olive brine; and a Stardust Sour with sherry, St-Germaine, Skinos and black pepper – before we were given a chance to mix one of our choice.\nA career at the bar is obviously not for me; I nearly sprayed the other participants with my Milky Meteor cocktail of Japanese whisky, Fernet Branca liquor, almond milk and pandan and coconut syrup when my shaker came apart. “That’s what the apron is for,” Mena chuckled as he wiped the spillage off the table.\nMeals and cocktails with top-notch – and charming – chefs and bartenders aside, the Ritz-Carlton Dining Series is also about experiencing the brand’s impeccable hospitality, from their cosy modern rooms with traditional elements and original art pieces right down to the under-rated breakfasts at Mizuki (Japanese) and La Locanda (international).\nTop tip: Don’t leave without trying the French toast at La Locanda. It’s as life-changing as the impromptu ravioli-making session, which a million loyalty points can’t buy.\n', 'related_topics': ['     food ', '     Restaurants ', '     Tokyo ', '     Kyoto ', '     Japan ', '     Fine dining ']}"

      Thailand moves closer to ban on toxic farm chemicals as concerns about food safety and human health grow
  </h1>, 'text': 'NONG BUA LAMPHU, Thailand: A toxic mist had descended as Somkid Sukchai walked through rows of sugarcane crops close to his home. A white dew dripped off the leaves of weeds growing along the way. It was a poisonous route.\nThe 70-year-old from Nong Bua Lamphu in northeast Thailand had been asked by his daughters to throw rice seeds in their field. To reach it, he had to pass through the property of his neighbour, who had just sprayed a powerful herbicide.\xa0\nSomkid had a small, fresh cut on his leg. As he washed in the river after finishing his work, he started to feel pain. It would be the start of a frightening health scare.\n“I was shivering from high fever. I was so cold that even with two or three blankets covering me, I still felt cold,” he said. “After that, the leg kept swelling and swelling. On the day I went to see a doctor, I vomited blood. A lot of blood.”\nSomkid had a severe infection - called necrotising fasciitis, which is more commonly known as a flesh-eating disease. It was suspected to be linked to exposure to paraquat, a toxic agricultural herbicide, commonly used by farmers across the country. Doctors had to fight to save his leg.\nFor years, activists, academics and even politicians have been trying to have the use of farming chemicals like paraquat restricted or banned in Thailand. Paraquat has been banned in 53 different countries around the world,\xa0including China from 2020 and Southeast Asian nations such as Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam.\xa0\nWhile other neighbouring nations have taken measures against it, Thailand has until now remained steadfast in allowing it.\xa0\nBut on Monday (Oct 7), representatives of four different sectors - the government, importers, farmers and consumers, as well as Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Cooperatives Mananya Thaiset - voted unanimously to ban paraquat, as well as other potentially dangerous farming chemicals glyphosate and chlorpyrifos.\nThis vote result is now expected to be submitted to the decision making body, the National Hazardous Substances Committee. If it is approved at this stage, the three substances could have their manufacture, importation, export, and sale prohibited in Thailand from Dec\xa01. The result will also be submitted to Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha, who had ordered the establishment of the four-sector working group.\nThe importation of paraquat has exploded over the past decade. Thai farmers have become increasingly reliant on what is a relatively cheap and effective weed killing product with the amount being imported into the country peaking dramatically in 2017 at just over 44 tonnes, nearly triple the amount 10 years before.\xa0\nWith the increased use of farming chemicals, health issues\xa0have followed. According to the National Health Security Office, farm chemicals have resulted in at least 1,715 deaths over the past three years, 600 of which were directly attributed to insecticides, pesticides, fungicides and herbicides. In addition, about\xa05,000 people required hospital treatment.\nToday, Somkid’s leg remains wrapped in a thick bandage, which covers a dark, wet wound. He is off his crutches but still struggles to walk freely. He also is far from the only victim in this small community.\nBeyond his wound, there are greater fears about the effects on long term human health and environmental contamination in areas like Nong Bua Lamphu. The science has plenty of skeptics, however, and is fiercely contested.\xa0\n‘NOBODY WANTS TO DIE’\nParaquat, which is manufactured by a number of companies,\xa0has been used since the 1950s to control weeds. It kills them on contact and is designed to break down immediately in soil. Its use in Thailand grew as farmers shifted from annual rice crop harvesting to year-round cultivation. The strain on fields meant more diseases and pests that required chemical\xa0solutions.\xa0\nIn Thailand now, growers of corn, maize, sugarcane, rubber and cassava rely most heavily on herbicides to aid their farming. Spraying paraquat on weeds saves significant time and toil compared with physically removing them.\nIn highland areas, where ploughing with machinery can be very difficult and exacerbate field erosion, the benefits are most pronounced. But as a result, researchers\xa0say\xa0that chemicals have been sweeping into water sources and flowing downstream where the effects are felt.\xa0\xa0\nRecent studies in northern provinces including Nong Bua Lamphu portray a concerning picture for food, water and human health.\xa0\nDr Puangrat Kajitvichyanukul, a professor of chemical engineering at Naresuan University, has done extensive research on the accumulation of chemicals in the environment. In Nong Bua Lamphu province in 2018, the paraquat concentration in reservoirs and other water supplies was found to be “extremely dangerous”. Tap water in 25 different communities was found to be contaminated by paraquat.\n“We found huge concentrations in the river almost everywhere in Nong Bua Lamphu. That has contaminated the land and also the vegetables,” she said.\xa0\n“We found high concentrations of paraquat in fish as well. We said, we can’t let it be like that without doing anything. If the people have contact with the water, they get a burning on the skin.”\xa0\nThe cases of necrotising fasciitis in the same Thai provinces in which paraquat was found in high concentrations soared in 2018, according to the study. For the researchers, the evidence suggested a causal connection and it was enough to concern locals.\n“They know that the illness does exist and that’s very close to their life. Nobody wants to die. And they are afraid,” Dr Puangrat said.\nElsewhere in the world, studies have linked paraquat to Parkinson\'s disease, an impact\xa0on women’s reproductive health and toxicity to vital organs.\xa0\nBut Syngenta, a Swiss company which uses paraquat as the active ingredient in its Gramoxone herbicide,\xa0stands by the safety of the product, telling CNA “that paraquat is safe in normal occupational use according to label instructions”.\n“The current studies that we have reviewed have not presented any new or conclusive evidence of these claims of (an) impact to health,” said Thanus Aphinives, the general manager of Syngenta Thailand.\xa0\nHe disputes the findings of Dr Puangrat and others that paraquat can be absorbed into the environment. Thai Pesticide Alert Network, for example, published findings in 2016 after conducting voluntary blood tests on more than 600 visitors to a food fair, showing 61.6 per cent had a risky level of farm chemical contamination.\n“When paraquat residues come into contact with soil, it becomes biologically inert and as a result it cannot be taken up by plant roots or other organisms,” Aphinives said. “Paraquat cannot be released from the soil or re-activated by the application of water or other agrochemicals.\xa0\n“The decision to stop the use of paraquat in some countries is disappointing as these decisions do not fully take into account the importance of the product to local agriculture and the potential cost this could add to farmers. There is no viable alternative to paraquat,” he said.\xa0\nSyngenta has been involved in the training of farmers around Thailand in the proper usage of paraquat. In April, the Thai government announced it was aiming to produce 2,200 experts on farming chemicals to go out and train 1.5 million farmers. Using products like paraquat incorrectly or against label instructions is a huge issue, Dr Puangrat admits.\nThey overdose and overuse the paraquat. Whatever it says on the label of the pesticide, they’re over that by eight times. That’s why it is a serious problem.\nBut others say the very nature of paraquat means it is unsafe, regardless of what precautions are taken. “Paraquat has too severe toxicity to safely use. It destroys without choosing,” said Witoon Liamchamroon, the director of BioThai, a think-tank pushing for sustainable agriculture and food security.\n“Therefore ‘safe use’ is just an excuse to keep selling this substance.”\nThe Thai government has so far not accepted the results of the various research into paraquat as conclusive and has been reluctant to issue any ban without a guaranteed chemical replacement for farmers to use.\nAs recently as February, paraquat’s use was approved by the Hazardous Substance Committee - a group of members from state agencies, academia and the private sector - for a further two years.\nBut that decision did not dampen critics’ hopes of an imminent ban and before developments this week, many were more optimistic than ever that one would be enacted within months.\n‘SHOULD WE BAN VEHICLES?’\nThe weight of public opinion, and of informed decision makers, seems to be shifting away from the continued use of agricultural chemicals.\nGroups have protested in big numbers in years gone by, but certain Thai government departments have stood in the way of reform on paraquat, glyphosate and chlorpyrifos.\nNow, leading politicians, including Deputy Prime Minister \u200eAnutin Charnvirakul, have become champions for a pursuit of a ban on paraquat. His Bhumjaithai party, an influential bloc in Thailand’s recently formed government, has campaigned hard on the issue.\nA ban also has crucial support within the Department of Agriculture, with\xa0Deputy Minister Mananya Thaiset\xa0committed to order a ban on the three chemicals by the end of this year.\n""I can\'t wait until all of them are banned. The only thing on my mind is how to make it stop right now. I don\'t believe in the current measures already in place. If the regulations really worked, people wouldn\'t be falling ill as a result of exposure to these toxic chemicals,” she told the Bangkok Post.\nIn addition, the Ministry of Education has pledged to ban paraquat in all 47 agricultural and fishery colleges under the ministry’s supervision, while the import limits of the chemicals has also been slashed by 50 per cent this year, seen as a beginning of a phasing out of their availability and use.\nParaquat\xa0still has its supporters though, like Professor Rungsit Suwanmankha, an outspoken expert on herbicides and herbicide toxicology. “Do you remember how many people died from road accidents during the Songkran festival and New Year? More than 40 or 50 persons per day. Should we ban vehicles?” he said.\nStill, some\xa0within affected communities are taking their own pre-emptive actions to curb the possible impact\xa0of chemicals on their lives.\nA SILENT INVADER\nKudpheung subdistrict in Nong Bua Lamphu has grown weary of the use of some substances. The community has now effectively banned the use of toxic chemicals within its boundaries - unless special permission and notice is given - and it locally enforces penalties on those who flaunt the rules.\nThe subdistrict head Thongla Sritahong says some people still use chemicals secretly, hiring outsiders to do the work. He says most locals do not dare do the spraying themselves.\n“The villagers have started to understand the consequences,” he said. “If a nationwide ban is possible, I would agree with it because villagers would be safe. If the issue is not resolved now in the future the younger generations will face difficulties. Food will become scarce and it will be risky to go into the water.”\nDr Puangrat describes paraquat as an “end of pipe” issue and describes a ban as a simple, but necessary band aid solution. She has been an advocate of solutions to the issue like the widespread promotion of organic farming practices and financial incentives that encourage farmers to go chemical free.\n“To solve this problem, it doesn’t end by banning paraquat. The government has to go to the root of the cause and then they can solve the real problem,” she said.\xa0\nBioThai’s Witoon believes solutions like using small farming equipment, planting ground cover plants and growing mixed crops instead of monocultures are potential fast solutions to help farmers do away with chemicals.\xa0\nOne village in Kudpheung has begun a chemical-free pilot program, with its pioneer Wichit Sangthong enthusiastically creating his own organic forms of weed killer by experimenting with different ingredients.\nIn his sugarcane field, Wichit demonstrates the effectiveness of his latest concoctions using banana tree, sour mango and rice whisky.\n“It’s safe to use. There’s no impact to the community,” he said. “I will make people in this village stop using this herbicide.”\nAdditional reporting by Ryn Jirenuwat\n', 'related_topics': ['     Thailand ', '     agriculture ', '     food ']}"

      India banned onion exports. Now Asia has eye-watering prices.
  </h1>, 'text': 'MUMBAI/DHAKA: From Kathmandu to Colombo, it\'s a kitchen nightmare: Onion prices have gone crazy.\nThat\'s because India, the world\'s biggest seller of the Asian diet staple, has banned exports after extended monsoon downpours delayed harvests and supplies shrivelled. And dedicated buyers across the region, like Nepalese housewife Seema Pokharel, are flummoxed.\n""This is a terrible increase,"" said Pokharel, out shopping for vegetables in Kathmandu. ""Onion prices have more than doubled in the last month alone.""\nWhether it\'s Pakistani chicken curry, Bangladeshi biryani or Indian sambar, Asian consumers have developed a serious dependence on Indian onion supplies for go-to dishes. Shorter shipment times than from rival exporters like China or Egypt play a crucial role in preserving the taste of the perishable commodity.\nBut last Sunday New Delhi banned all exports from India after local prices jumped to 4,500 rupees (US$63.30) per 100kg, their highest in nearly six years, due to the delay in summer-sown crop arrivals triggered by longer, heavier rains than usual.\nSince the ban, countries such as Bangladesh have turned to the likes of Myanmar, Egypt, Turkey and China to increase supplies in a bid bring prices down, government officials and traders said.\nBut the hefty volumes lost will be hard to replace.\nIndia exported 2.2 million tonnes of fresh onions in the 2018/19 fiscal year ended Mar\xa031, according to data from India\'s Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority. That\'s more than half of all imports by Asian countries, traders estimate.\n""TAKING ADVANTAGE""\nRising prices of alternative supplies will add to the headache for importers trying to get the vegetable from elsewhere, said Mohammad Idris, a trader based in Dhaka. In the Bangladesh capital, consumers are now being asked to pay 120 taka (US$1.42) per kilogramme for their prized onions - twice the price a fortnight ago and the highest since December, 2013.\n""Prices are going up elsewhere in Asia and Europe,"" said Idris. ""Other exporting countries are taking advantage of the Indian ban"" to raise their asking price.\nIn response to the crisis, the government of Bangladesh has initiated sales of subsidised onions through the state-run Trading Corporation of Bangladesh (TCB).\n""We are looking for all possible options to import onions. Our target is to import in the shortest possible time,"" said TCB spokesman Humayun Kabir.\nBut the shipments from elsewhere - Iran and Turkey are also potential suppliers - that authorities in countries across the region are investigating will all take time.\n""It takes one month when it comes from Egypt and about 25 days from China, while it takes only a few days from India,"" said Dhaka trader Idris.\nThe need for alternative imports is so severe, though, that countries like Sri Lanka have already placed orders with Egypt and China, said G Rajendran, president of the Essential Food Commodities, Importers and Traders Association.\nOnion prices in Sri Lanka have risen by 50 per cent\xa0in a week, to 280-300 Sri Lankan rupees (US$1.7) per kilogramme.\xa0\n""DOUBLE THE PRICE""\nFor other countries, there may be little option but to sit tight and hope for the best.\nMalaysia, the second-biggest buyer of Indian onions, expects the ban to be temporary and sees no reason to panic, said Sim Tze Tzin, deputy minister of agriculture.\nBut even India has been importing onions from Egypt in an effort to calm prices. And there won\'t be any meaningful drop in prices before summer-sown crops start to hit the market, said Ajit Shah, president of the Mumbai-based Onion Exporters\' Association.\nThat\'s not expected until mid-November, meaning the export ban isn\'t going away in the near term.\n""India could resume exports once prices drop, but it will take time,"" said Shah. ""Until India resumes exports, supplies will remain limited in Asia.""\nFor now, consumers like Kathmandu shopper Pokharel are having to change habits across Asia.\n""I went to buy 5kg\xa0of onions for our five-member family but ended up buying only 3kg\xa0due to higher prices,"" said Afroza Mimi, a Dhaka housewife on a shopping expedition the day after India imposed the export ban.\n""They (traders) are selling old stock nearly at double the price.

      'Once they are gone, it will really be a pity': Orchard Rd ice-cream carts could end with their owners
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Attending to his customers, Mr Chieng Puay Chui and his ice-cream cart have been a familiar sight along Orchard Road for about three decades.\nThe 71-year-old, more commonly known as Uncle Chieng to his customers, has been an ice-cream street hawker since 1965. About 30 years ago, he decided to start selling ice-cream along Orchard Road outside the old Tangs building, and moved to his current spot in front of Ngee Ann City when it opened 26 years ago.\xa0\nBut his ice-cream cart and six others along the stretch of shopping street could become a memory when their licence holders pass on.\nStreet hawkers like Mr Chieng hold licences that are personal to the holder and non-transferable, said the Singapore Food Agency (SFA).\nThey cannot transfer their licence to family members or friends who might want to take over.\xa0\n“It’ll be a pity if there are no more ice-cream uncles, especially because this is Singapore’s traditional ice-cream,” said Mr Chieng in Mandarin. “I don’t know if anything will be done to make sure Orchard Road will still have ice-cream uncles in the future.”\nMr Chieng is among 13 street hawkers allowed to sell ice-cream on any ""public land”, according to SFA, with seven choosing to operate along\xa0Orchard Road.\nTourists from Indonesia, China, Thailand and the Philippines have heard of his ice-cream cart, and many of them visit Orchard Road to meet him, he told CNA.\nMr Chieng is the only one there\xa0who\xa0sells scooped ice-cream, with the different flavours mixed together.\xa0\nAs shown by the numerous photos displayed at his stall, many celebrities in the region also come to try Mr Chieng’s ice-cream. Most recently, former Thailand prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra visited the stall on Sep 9.\nHis son, Mr Alvin Chieng, often helps out at the stall when he can. The younger Mr Chieng even helped his father set up a Facebook page about two years ago, to reach a younger audience on social media.\xa0\n“He’s getting old and he can’t sell ice-cream on his own anymore. This traditional scooped ice-cream is a Singaporean speciality, and many tourists come to Orchard Road to eat it. It’ll be sad if it’s gone,” said the 39-year-old.\nIn a written reply to a parliamentary question\xa0in 2016, Minister for the Environment and Water Resources Masagos Zulkifli said that street hawkers were licensed in 1994, in a one-time exercise to control their numbers, and “no more licences were issued after that"".\xa0\n“The intention was to phase out these street hawkers through natural attrition and allow such trades to move into proper premises,” he added.\xa0\nMr Masagos explained that the street hawking scheme was reopened in the early 2000s to temporarily help those who are needy and less employable tide over their financial difficulties.\nSFA did not respond to further queries about the number of street hawker applications to sell ice-cream on Orchard Road it has received, how many were approved and whether there are plans to ensure that ice-cream street hawkers will continue to operate in the area.\xa0\nAll the ice-cream street hawkers on Orchard Road hold an islandwide licence, which allows them to sell ice-cream and canned beverages in public areas in Singapore.\xa0\nMr Chieng explained that newer street hawkers hold a licence that only allows them to operate within the town council where they live, which is why there are so few ice-cream street hawkers on Orchard Road.\xa0\nSFA said there are about 200 street hawkers who have chosen to sell ice-cream.\n\n“IT IS WHAT IT IS”\nNot all ice-cream street hawkers are sad to see their trade go. Mr Tan Ah Hock, who has been selling ice-cream since 1967, said: “I’m quite tired, but I still have to continue to work even if I’m tired,” adding that he plans to retire in two to three years.\xa0\n“About 75 per cent of my customers are tourists,” he said.\xa0\nWhen asked about the trade dying out, the 75-year-old said in Mandarin: “I’m not very sad. It is what it is.”\nAbout 20 years ago, there were more than 30 ice-cream hawkers along Orchard Road, with many of them gathering where Ion\xa0Orchard now stands, recalled Mr Tan, whose stall is located outside Wisma Atria.\xa0\nMr Chan Yong Leng, who started selling ice-cream along Orchard Road in the 2000s, thinks his trade will disappear in a few years. “Technology is taking over and there are nice ice-cream shops in the air-conditioned malls too,” he added.\xa0\n“There were so many stalls back then and the competition was very strong. Now there are seven, and that’s enough for the whole road.” The 74-year-old added that he plans to sell ice-cream in Orchard Road until he can no longer work.\xa0\nAll seven ice-cream hawkers know each other, and have their designated spot along Orchard Road, said Mr Chan.\xa0\n“We won’t go to someone else’s spot to sell ice-cream. In the past, people would fight over that,” he added.\xa0\nTourists and locals CNA spoke to said they would miss the ice-cream street hawkers.\xa0\nMs Grace Yohanna, a tourist from Indonesia who was visiting Singapore with her husband for the second time, told CNA that Singapore’s ice-cream street hawkers along Orchard Road are a must-see for most Indonesian tourists visiting Singapore.\xa0\n“It would be strange to not see people holding this traditional ice-cream while walking down Orchard Road,” said the 34-year-old.\xa0\nMr Mixie Ky, 26, thinks more should be done to help improve the livelihood of the ice-cream street hawkers.\xa0\n“They are quite old, maybe more can be done to use technology to upgrade the stalls or enhance the facilities available,” he said.\xa0\nThe tourist from the Philippines who is visiting Singapore with friends for the first time said the ice-cream street hawkers “give character” to Orchard Road.\n“I didn’t know that there are so few left here. It’s like Singapore’s special product, so it’s quite sad,” he added.\xa0\nFor many Singaporeans, the ice-cream street hawkers were a common sight growing up. Mr Lucas Lin, 29, remembers buying ice-cream from street hawkers in his HDB estate, as well as at Orchard Road.\nNoting that the ice-cream street hawkers are also part of Singapore’s hawker culture, he said: “Once they are gone, it will really be a pity. I think we will lose an important part of our traditional heritage. It’s just like seeing hawker centres replaced by food courts.\n“I’m not saying that someone must definitely take over the ice-cream uncles, but if we can still retain this tradition, that would be good. It’s unique to Singapore, just like our hawkers.”\xa0\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     food ', '     Orchard Road ']}"

      As beansprout prices shoot up in Singapore, will they go missing from our favourite dishes?
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Be it laksa, mee soto, popiah or prawn mee, they all share a common ingredient we don’t often think about until it’s missing - the humble towgay or beansprout.\nFew people realise that in Singapore, about\xa040,000kg of beansprouts are consumed daily;\xa0that’s well over 14,000 tonnes a year.\nBut in recent years, the price\xa0of beansprouts has spiked dramatically;\xa0beansprouts at wet markets these days cost at least S$1.50 per kg as compared to about S$0.90 per kg about four years ago.\nThat works out to about a 70 per cent increase, way more than inflation over those years.\n“In the past ten years, costs have increased,” explained Thomas Tan, owner of Chiam Joo Seng Towgay in Lim Chu Kang, one of the biggest suppliers of this crop.\xa0\n“This is a very labour-intensive industry, the foreign workers’ levy has increased a lot more, diesel prices have increased by double, and bean prices increased by double too.”\nBut as the programme For Food’s Sake! discovers, is it really production costs that have gone up, driving the price of beansprouts or is the price spike due to a demand and supply issue?\nSUPERMARKET TOWGAY DOUBLE THE PRICE\nBeansprouts are probably one of the cheapest vegetables out there and for cooking at home, most people usually don’t need more than a handful.\nThis perhaps explains why most people have not\xa0noticed a sharp spike in beansprout prices in the last couple of years.\xa0\nBut the price hike has not\xa0escaped the notice of vegetable sellers who deal with beansprouts in bulk.\nAround 70 per cent of the beansprouts we eat is grown right here in Singapore.\nTan grew up in a beansprout farming family - his father and uncle were one of the earliest beansprout farmers in Singapore.\nHe said that most farmers in Singapore get their mung beans from Myanmar, and in 2015 there was a spike in the price of mung beans due to a bad harvest in India, which resulted in the latter buying more beans from Myanmar.\n“The price went up as much as four times,” said\xa0Tan.\xa0\n“At that point I stopped selling to the wet market and I understand that the rest of the farmers (in Singapore) stopped absorbing the cost and increased the wet market price.”\nThe price hike in mung beans resulted in a price increase for beansprouts, an increase which was passed to consumers.\nIn wet markets, beansprouts which used to cost S$0.90 per kg a few years ago now costs S$1.50 per kg.\nBut the same product in supermarkets has gone up even more -\xa0beansprouts which used to cost S$1 per kg now costs S$3.50 per kg on average.\nThat makes supermarket sprouts at least twice as expensive compared to wet market ones.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\nSo, what makes beansprouts in supermarkets so much more expensive than their wet market counterparts?\nTan said he stopped selling to wet markets because of the low prices, and he now supplies mainly to supermarkets and restaurants.\nA decade ago, beansprouts would be de-husked at the farms the day before and then displayed loose in supermarkets, like they are at wet markets.\nBut at supermarkets, customers have unrestrained access to the sprouts, and all that manhandling meant unsold sprouts had to be tossed at the end of the day.\nTan saw a market opportunity and offered supermarkets pre-packaged beansprouts with cold chain management, a system of storing and transporting perishable products such as vegetables at recommended temperatures from the point of harvest to the final consumer.\nWhat’s more, Tan also offered to deliver the beansprouts throughout the day, not just in the morning.\nHow this produce is delivered to supermarkets had a huge bearing on its price.\nFor Tan, the additional S$1 million investment for cold chain management such as packing machines, cold trucks and other equipment meant he had to raise the price of beansprouts to about S$2.20 per kg.\n“We were the first ones to sell in the supermarkets the pre-packed form, to maintain the freshness (of the beansprouts). Over a period of time, customers got more used to it now,"" said Tan, admitting that they were the ones who single-handedly raised the prices of beansprouts in supermarkets.\nSince Tan started supplying pre-packed beansprouts to supermarkets, other companies have followed suit.\nAnd they all follow Singapore Food Agency’s recommendations for cold chain management where vegetables are kept between 2°C to 6°C from farm to retail outlets, to bring about fresher and higher quality vegetables.\nPREMIUM BEANSPROUTS\nAside from freshness and convenience, there is another factor that is pushing up the average price of supermarket sprouts, the emergence of premium beansprouts.\nThe most expensive are the silver sprouts, which have been plucked on both ends, at an eye-watering price of $1.25/145g or S$8.60 per kg.\nThat is almost six times more than the wet market variety.\nPlucking beansprouts is tedious but with pre-plucked and prepacked silver sprouts, all that is done for the consumers. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\n“Silver sprouts are very popular. For every three regular packet of beansprouts, I sell one packet of silver sprouts,” said Tan.\xa0\n“But the problem is getting enough supply. Producing silver sprouts cannot be mechanised. Plucking sprouts is still a very labour intensive product.”\nHe shared that how he used to hire 40 women residing in two HDB blocks of flats to pluck the beansprouts during the 2008 global financial crisis but after that period, “no one in Singapore wanted to do it at that pay anymore”.\nThese days, he imports his silver sprouts from Malaysia.\nAngie Ng, owner of Mr Tauge, one of the main Malaysian suppliers of silver sprouts to Singapore, said that even they have trouble hiring full-time help to pluck the beansprouts.\nShe said that eventually they will not\xa0be able to find people willing to pluck beansprouts for a living, and silver sprouts could soon be a thing of the past.\xa0\n“We have tried hiring, but the results weren’t good,” she said. “You have to spend seven to eight hours here, a lot of people aren’t willing,” she said.\nWatch the episode here.\n', 'related_topics': ['     food ']}"

      Going back to the classics at Bangkok’s old-school restaurants
  </h1>, 'text': ""For those seeking out a heady hit of authentic Bangkok food culture, it pays to go back to the classics: The long-established restaurants where appearances and customer service play second fiddle to flavour and cooking experience.\nIntrinsically linked to the city’s street food heritage, many of the city’s oldest restaurants were established by upwardly mobile vendors whose success allowed them the financial wherewithal to set up in more permanent premises.\n\n\nSuch security also allowed some of them to expand their repertoire. Michelin-star winner Jay Fai (whom you might recognise from Netflix’s Street Food), for instance, started out cooking only chicken noodles before graduating onto complex, fiery soups like tom yum, fluffy crab omelettes, and stir-fried treats.\nOther traditional restaurants, meanwhile, have tome-like menus listing everything from curries to seafood specialities.\nDiverse they may be, and aesthetically appealing they usually are not, but the best of these old-school venues are uniform in their commitment to culinary excellence.\n\n\nJAY FAI\nIn her trademark set of heat-resistant goggles, essential protection from the searing inferno of ingredients she oversees, Jay Fai cuts a distinctive figure: A street-food superhero, if you like.\nA kitchen dynamo whose energy belies her septuagenarian status, the proprietor/chef at one of Bangkok’s most renowned shophouse restaurants – the eponymous Jay Fai – has become one of the city’s most recognisable food personalities.\nAnd her fame has only been enhanced by her recognition by the Michelin guide judges, who awarded her with a star in the French foodie bible’s inaugural Thailand edition in 2018.\nIndeed, waits of up to three hours for a table are not uncommon these days for walk-up customers. We advise sending an email to jayfaibangkok [at] gmail.com well in advance.\nHer lofty reputation is founded on the alchemy she produces from her scalding wok, with stir-fries such as pad kee mao (drunkard’s noodles) and other dishes like fluffy khai jiew poo (crab omelette) and a complex tom yam gung (hot and sour shrimp soup) more than justifying the steep prices.\n327 Maha Chai Rd, Khwaeng Samran Rat, Khet Phra Nakhon\nMETHAVALAI SORNDAENG\nWith an army of stiff waiters kitted out with white jackets and dated floral decor, this stalwart doesn’t even try to square with perceived ideas of hipness.\nFor the wealthy grandpas and their big-haired wives that flock here to dine off crisp-white linen while being serenaded by a live band, it’s as cool as it needs to be.\nAnd if you are not bowled over by the soothing tones of the resident band’s vocalist, there’s a good chance that you will be by the food.\nA tome-like menu offering hundreds of dishes is tricky to negotiate. Unlike other places where variety is often a substitute for quality, this place has had over 60-experience of perfecting the dishes in its repertoire.\nAll-time favourites include krathong thong (crispy golden pastry cups filled with spicy minced pork and sweet corn) and khao tang na tang (rice crackers with minced prawn and pork dip.)\nfacebook.com/methavalaisorndaeng\nSANGUAN SRI\nIn a city where style often takes precedence over substance, it can be refreshing to note how little mind is taken to appearances in some of Bangkok’s older restaurants.\nFor example, Saunguan Sri – a huge favourite with the lunch crowd from the offices that line leafy Witthayu Road – is housed inside a squat concrete building that looks like a nuclear bunker. Its interior, meanwhile, could double up as an army mess hall or a school canteen.\nIt’s a striking contrast to neighbours and near-neighbours that include Central Embassy, one of the city’s most luxurious malls, and tony condominiums, embassies and office buildings.\nFood is always a great leveller in Thailand and fragrant curries such as the gaeng kia wan nuea (beef green curry) are a testament to the enduring popularity of the venue. Arrive before midday to be sure of a seat.\n59/1 Witthayu Rd\nNearest BTS station: Phloen Chit\nSOEI\nAlthough his everyman appearance makes him easy to overlook, Soei – the owner/chef at another of Bangkok’s self-named restaurants – is no shrinking violet in the kitchen.\nUnlike many other chefs at the traditional Thai restaurants in Bangkok, Soei did not graduate from the street. Instead, the sports-mad chef honed his culinary skills by cooking for his rugby teammates following matches.\nHis airy venue in the Ari neighbourhood of Bangkok is packed with families and friends of the chef, who wash down his potent dishes with lashings of whisky and soda.\nThailand's reputation for having some of the spiciest food on the planet is sometimes overplayed, but this is one venue where having an iron-clad palate is a definite advantage.\nWhile undoubtedly fiery, the cuisine served here is among the most inventive and skilfully presented traditional Thai food in Bangkok.\nBig hitters here include the shu shee plaoo tod (fried mackerel in fresh coconut curry) and gung chae nam pla (shrimp in fish sauce). Another dish to try is kaem pla too tud (Indian mackerel cheeks), which are deep-fried to a satisfying crisp and served with garlic and salt.\n“I like to have fun when I’m cooking,” said Soei. “And I like my customers to enjoy themselves and my food.”\nPhibun Watthana 6 Alley, Khwaeng Samsen Nai, Khet Phaya Thai\nNearest BTS station: Ari\nYONG LEE\nThis shophouse restaurant just off bustling Sukhumvit Road has been around for decades and nobody could argue that it’s not showing its age.\nWeather-beaten picture menus display an array of wonderfully archaic Thai fusion dishes such as beef tongue stew and deep-fried slabs of fish coated in a thick garlicky syrup.\nThe shabby decor inside the restaurant majors in contrasting shades of deep brown, while the packed tables of elderly Thai-Chinese customers seem to highlight its anachronistic appeal.\nIn an area where trendy new dining spots appear with the regularity of a ticking metronome, Yong Lee may seem like an anomaly. For those who prize Bangkok’s long-standing culinary mores, however, the presence of such venues is a source of comfort.\n“Restaurants like this serve food that is a far cry from the corporate one-size-fits-all Thai food that you get at some of the chains and tourist-friendly restaurants in Bangkok,” said blogger and author Chawadee Nualkhair.\nOther culinary trips down memory lane here include yieldingly soft tongue and Anglicised chicken curry that could well have been pinched directly from the pages of a 1950s UK cookery book.\n213 ปาก ซอย ร่วมใจ Khlong Toei Nuea, Watthana\nNearest BTS station: Asok\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Bangkok ', '     Thailand ', '     food ', '     Restaurants ', '     Chefs ']}"

  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Firms in the service industry will get a leg up to further drive transformation and become manpower-lean with the new\xa0Service Industry Transformation Programme (SITP) launched on Wednesday (Sep 11) by Manpower Minister Josephine Teo.\xa0\nCo-developed by the Singapore Productivity Centre and Workforce Singapore, the programme will equip firms with tools to develop their service delivery model, as well as job redesign techniques needed to catalyse and start their business transformation.\nThis programme is part of the Lean Enterprise Development Scheme (LEDS), which helps enterprises adopt manpower-lean initiatives and drive business growth.\nIn her speech, Mrs Teo highlighted how some firms have already embarked on efforts to facilitate lean processes. She noted the usefulness of such a move amid the uncertainties that surround today\'s economy, including possible labour constraints.\xa0\n“Some people are naturally a little bit worried\xa0and they may even ask:\xa0‘Why are we spending time thinking about transformation and jobs of the future, shouldn’t we instead be thinking about survival, and jobs of the present, not jobs of the future?’”\n“We have to do both,” she said alluding to how Singapore is fundamentally labour-constrained.\n“On the Government\'s part, please be assured that we will continue to support businesses in your transformation journeys. We are in this together,” said Mrs Teo.\nThe SITP will cover two tracks in helping firms optimise their deployment of the\xa0current workforce, and improve job quality to attract and retain more talents.\nThe four-month programme comprises a two-day workshop\xa0and nearly seven days of on-site training, plus individual company project guidance.\nCompanies embarking on transformation projects under the SITP will also receive funding support of up to 90 per cent.\nSix firms have signed up since the programme was piloted in August, said Mrs Teo.\nOne of them is vegetarian food joint Greendot, which was established in 2011. It now has more than 10 outlets across Singapore.\xa0\nAs the industry does not typically appeal to the younger generation, Greendot has hired more than 100 elderly workers.

      How chefs Andre Chiang and Jimmy Lim are modernising heritage foods
  </h1>, 'text': 'After shutting his\xa0eponymous restaurant in Singapore\xa0last February and returning to his birthplace in Taiwan,\xa0feted chef Andre Chiang\xa0has been busy nurturing young talents and building new concepts across Asia. His latest, Sichuan Moon, which opened at the Wynn Palace Macau in March, aims to put Sichuan cuisine on the global map.\n\n\nIngeniously reinterpreted for today, the menu spotlights the complexity of the cuisine via a provocative menu of elevated dishes. It’s headed by former Restaurant Andre chef Zor Tan, who achieved much success at both Raw in Taipei and Restaurant Andre.\xa0\nThe aim of reimagining traditional cuisine for a new generation of diners is easy enough to understand and appreciate, but the task is anything but easy. The dishes need to be creative without being gimmicky. One of the biggest challenges, shared Chiang, lies in the fact that everyone thinks they know Sichuan cuisine. ""So, whatever you do, the flavours have to make sense.""\nAlso based in Taiwan, Singapore’s Jimmy Lim of JL Studio – this year’s recipient of the prestigious Miele One To Watch Award at\xa0Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants – is finding huge success in championing his take on\xa0modern Singaporean cuisine, but using ingredients sourced from surrounding farms in the Taichung area. It’s a cuisine, he explained, that is inspired by flavours of his childhood, one that reflects his upbringing and cultural influences.\xa0\n“My aim is to create dishes that are modern and more elegant adaptations (of familiar dishes and flavours) but still very Singaporean,” Lim said. “Every dish has a different inspiration, a unique perspective.”\nSICHUAN MOON’S HOT AND SOUR SOUP\n“It’s new but we still keep its authentic taste. The flavours have to make sense – that’s the biggest challenge. I wanted every (mouthful to offer something interesting), some bite and pops of flavours, which is why we’ve incorporated ingredients like the balsamic vinegar pearls and (drops of) spring onion oil. And it’s more pepper hot than chilli hot. We don’t only use white pepper but also the green ones, with a lemony taste – we wrap them and infuse them into the soup for a lighter, brighter and cleaner taste.”\xa0– Andre Chiang\nSichuan Moon, Wynn Palace, Avenida Da Nave Desportiva, Cotai, Macau \n\n\nJL STUDIO’S SHROOM KUT TEH\n“I’m always trying to find a way to balance (Singapore’s) unique flavours in my dishes.

      Nasi kandar shop in Penang draws crowd with century-old recipes
  </h1>, 'text': ""GEORGE TOWN, Penang: Queueing for up to an hour under the hot sun is\xa0no issue for\xa0customers of\xa0the famous Hameediyah nasi kandar restaurant in downtown Penang.\xa0\nDuring most days, the line\xa0spills out of the premises and into the busy street, a sign of the restaurant's\xa0popularity.\xa0\n\nOptions are aplenty, with\xa0fried seafood, cabbage with masala spices, ladies’ fingers and more.\xa0\nThe workers operate\xa0with\xa0efficiency, piling the customers' picks on either white rice or yellow briyani.\xa0\nAnd then comes\xa0the best part - ladles of piping hot gravy are\xa0poured on the rice, covering almost the entire\xa0plate.\nThe curries – choices of chicken, mutton, fish head and prawn – fill the air with a mouthwatering spicy aroma.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\nMr Muhd Lufti Hamzah, a Penang resident\xa0who frequents the restaurant, said he is addicted\xa0to Hameediyah’s curry.\n“The curry is really the best in Penang, and when I taste it, the flavours just meld perfectly. I will queue for this,” he added.\nFor more than a century since the establishment opened in 1907, the concoction\xa0of chilli powder, cinnamon, cardamom, cloves and a dozen other Indian spices in the curry stew has drawn a steady stream of customers.\nToday, Hameediyah continues to command a loyal following among the locals in Penang, as well as foreign visitors wishing to sample one of the state’s most famous dishes.\nWith its long history of serving the popular fare, it is likely the oldest nasi kandar restaurant in Malaysia.\n\n\nTHROUGH BRITISH COLONIAL PERIOD, JAPANESE OCCUPATION\nAhamed Seeni Pakir,\xa0the sixth-generation owner of\xa0the establishment, has his great-great-great-grandfather to thank for the successful business he now runs.\xa0\nHe shared stories of how the late Mohamed Thamby Rawther began selling nasi kandar during the British colonial period.\nA spice trader from India, Mr Mohamed Thamby\xa0rented a shophouse at Campbell Street to sell\xa0rice with curry to show his customers how to use the spices in their cooking.\nHe and other Indian traders would balance a pole, or ‘kandar’ in Malay, across their shoulders, with two baskets on both ends carrying pots of rice, curry, vegetable and meat. This method of carrying food gave nasi kandar its name.\nMr Ahamed said\xa0the nasi kandar sellers\xa0would sell the dishes at the trading docks at nearby Penang Jetty, calling out to attract customers.\n“The area in front of Mr Mohamed Thamby's shophouse had an angsana tree and open field. He would walk from the tree to the jetty, yelling ‘Nasi kandar!’ The locals loved it,” he said.\nBusiness continued through the Japanese Occupation during World War II, Mr Ahamed said.\n“The Japanese soldiers stationed in Penang were very fond of curry, and my parents told me they would come to Lebuh Campbell to eat nasi kandar as well. It was universally popular,” he said.\nAfter the war, the British granted a permit for Hameediyah to operate as a restaurant, and that was when business started to flourish, he said.\xa0\n“During those days, our customers didn’t have much of a choice.\n“We would scoop rice, curry, a vegetable dish - which was usually ladies’ fingers - and an egg for all customers. It came as a set. But they still loved it, I can still remember the queues during the Merdeka days,” he added.\n\n\nMr Ahamed said he sympathised\xa0with customers who have to wait at least 30 minutes to an hour to order their food.\n“They don’t mind queueing for a long time, provided they get to eat,” he said.\n“They come with family and friends on celebratory occasions or just for a hearty meal. It’s an ideal place for a family feast,” added the 65-year-old.\nIn addition to this Campbell Street restaurant,\xa0Hameediyah has three other outlets – one in Penang and two near Malaysia’s capital\xa0Kuala Lumpur.\nGENERATIONS-OLD FORMULA\nWhat is the secret to Hameediyah’s continued success?\nIt makes its own curry and masala spices\xa0using fresh spices and ghee imported from India, Mr Ahamed revealed.\n“We don’t buy commercial spice mix. We don’t use MSG or other processed spices to achieve a certain taste. We stick to the age old method based on a formula that has been passed down for generations,” he said.\nThe spices are used for the restaurant’s signature dishes - beef rendang, chicken kapitan, chicken curry and briyani rice - and the cooks treat each pot of curry with great care. \xa0\n“When making the curry, we sample it more than 20 times before we declare the taste is right,” he said.\n\n\nWhile it has an array of established dishes that is popular among customers, Mr Ahamed is aware that the outlet needs to offer new options to attract repeat customers, especially with the intense competition among nasi kandar outlets in Penang.\n“We have exotic choices, like geese, rabbit or ostrich curry for those who want to try, but it’s not for everyone,” he said.\nThe outlet at Campbell Street also has a station dedicated to making murtabak, a thick meat pancake savoured with curry dishes, and a traditional stove for baking naan.\nA French visitor, who wanted to be known only as Amelie, told CNA that she visited the restaurant every day during her two-week stay in Penang.\n“The curry is something out of this world,” said the 29-year-old. “Since I don’t usually eat rice, I have murtabak and naan to go with the different gravies.\n“I’ll fly back to Penang again just for this.”\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Malaysia ', '     food ']}"

      Food of the future? Five-star edible insects served up as Thailand gets creative with bug business
  </h1>, 'text': 'BANGKOK: The tasting menu at Chef Surasit Buttama’s restaurant at first glance contains many of the culinary elements you would expect at a fine dining establishment: scallops with Jerusalem artichokes, ravioli with turmeric saffron sauce and grilled seabass with blackened corn salsa.\nBut intertwined and infused into each of the dishes, there is something unusual. Silkworms, wingless long horned grasshoppers and bamboo caterpillars are unabashedly showcased as integral parts of each plate.\nThe dishes are creatively composed and executed with precision. Still, seeing a giant water beetle with wings outstretched perched on pasta - as elegant as that might sound - is a challenge for the uninitiated diner.\nChef Gong, as he is known, is not just dabbling with insects. They are his entire premise, a deep dive into an alternative protein that he believes will shake the restaurant industry in Thailand and beyond in the coming years.\xa0\n“In our restaurant, we strive to bring insects to be made into food for people to feel, eat and taste, and to make them open their minds in order to prepare themselves for the near future.”\nAll of the insects used in the restaurant are sourced from organic operations, mostly in northern and eastern Thailand. It is an important guiding philosophy - produce that is sustainably farmed or foraged and which supports local producers.\nBeing conscientious of the origin of food and its impact on the planet has been a leading trend in global food in recent years. Yet despite their obvious health benefits - notably very high protein levels that exceed typical red meat - and a far softer footprint on the environment to farm, insects are still a culinary oddity.\nBut Chef Gong is sure they will be the next big thing. Aside from the fun he derives from experimenting and creating, driving his concept is a desire to tackle looming food supply issues.\xa0\n“We see that in the future, the population will increase and there won’t be enough protein sources for the increased population. “We will use more water, more electricity, and more manpower. So, we looked for alternative sources of protein. We then found insects,” he said.\n""If we wanted to have cow farming, we would need to cut down trees or buy bigger land and build a factory. But for insect farming, we need less space, we use less water and we need less feed. This will help a lot if we start to wake up.”\nEven in Thailand where insect consumption is part of the culture of many communities, Chef Gong\xa0knows that convincing people to betray their instincts and stick a fork into a bug on their plate is not an easy task.\xa0\nStill, in the two years Insects in the Backyard has been open, he\xa0has been encouraged by the response and increasing patronage, including from many international tourists, particularly from Singapore.\n“For people who have never tried insects before, when we serve the dishes and say, ‘enjoy your dinner’, some of them would say ‘oh my god!’ Some of them scream or say they have goosebumps. But once they try the dishes, they would say they are delicious,” Surasit said.\nOne of the restaurant\'s customers on the day of CNA’s visit, Pakwan Chinpattanawanich, was eating alone and admitted\xa0her friends did not\xa0join her on this visit. “If you know how to eat then you eat them. But if you don’t then you don’t dare to try!” she said.\xa0\n“I love eating insects but I don’t normally get to eat various kinds. It’s so diverse. I think they are delicious.”\nThailand has become the world’s leader in this industry, and Chef Gong is far from alone in seizing the initiative to promote this kind of eating on a broader scale.\xa0\nTOM YUM BUGS\nIn Suan Pheung, Ratchaburi province - about 170 kilometres west of Bangkok - crickets are growing. Not in fields or forests but on carefully stacked trays inside dark, purpose-made buildings.\xa0\nThese incubators are climate controlled and sterile. Hiding inside,\xa0the ingredients in a new phase of Thailand’s edible insect industry are multiplying. This is a farm but not how one might traditionally imagine it.\nInsects have long been grown for eating in Thailand, but it was only in the late 1990s that the technology to breed and farm crickets was introduced to Thai farmers after new research done at Khon Kaen University.\nWithin 15 years, there were approximately 20,000 farms operating across the country, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), which in 2013 recognised Thailand as “one of the few countries in the world to have developed a viable and thriving insect farming sector”.\nMarket conditions were challenging and researchers noted a lack of support for producers. Most of the insects would be sold directly to market vendors or small restaurants.\xa0\nFor the urban consumer, there was little evidence of the industry’s existence. And Thatnat Chanthatham saw an opportunity.\nThatnat is the president of Smile Bull Marketing and producer of crispy baked insect brand, Hiso - a mischievous play on a commonly used Thai slang expression for “high society”. The idea is to elevate the notion of eating insects beyond traditional markets and into contemporary, marketable products that can be sold across the world.\n“In Thailand, we have street foods and we consume insects from food carts. Our idea was to make street food more hygienic and safe, and make an alternative and give more choices. This was how we started,” he said.\n“But then we were thinking about if it was necessary that the insects have the same taste as those being sold in wheel carts. Could they have other tastes? Could they have a BBQ, cheesy, nori seaweed or, Thais’ favourite, tom yum taste?\n“We wanted to be the ones who use innovation and process insects into various forms, making them more accessible.”\nOnce they reach a suitable size and maturity at around 50 days, the crickets being farmed in Suan Pheung will be collected, asphyxiated, frozen, cleaned and sorted. They are eventually flavoured and placed into snack sized packaging, which looks similar to potato chips or nori seaweed sheets.\nHiso snacks can be purchased in some convenience stores\xa0as well as major supermarket chains in Thailand. It is available overseas in Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam and Thatnat says talks have begun for the snacks to be exported to Singapore, Malaysia and Japan.\nIn a further overseas market push, Thatnat’s group also produces cricket powder, which is touted as a health protein supplement and targeted at customers in Europe and the United States. This is insect eating 4.0 for Thailand which is taking the product beyond the “ugly” physical appearance of insects, which many people struggle with, Thatnat said.\xa0\nBusiness is steady but\xa0not exploding, he admitted. The company processes about two tonnes of insects per month but domestic sales have not been growing. It is raw evidence of the hurdle to reach the mainstream.\n“It is very difficult even for Thailand where people already consume insects. It is very hard to do marketing and send messages out that the insects people consume aren’t just snacks but they have benefits,” he said.\n“We make ads and send information out a lot that insects have high protein and how good they are and how consuming them can help reduce global warming. But for Asia and for Thais, they aren’t interested in this.”\nThe United Nations is a leading voice in promoting such enterprises in the face of concerns about global food sustainability and rising hunger. Some of the considerations for such advice include insect farming\xa0being 12 times more efficient than cattle when it comes to converting feed to meat, and four times more efficient than pigs. The output of greenhouse gases in their production is a fraction of large scale operations for other proteins. Animal welfare, water use and the risk of spreadable infections are other factors, although FAO says more research is still needed to settle the science.\n""Integrating insects into the diet may assist to address nutrition issues and food insecurity in the region,"" said Katinka de Balogh, Senior Animal Health and Production Officer with FAO in Bangkok.\n""Nevertheless, further improvement in farmer knowledge, practices and attitude in using insects as part of their diets and in livestock production is needed.\nOver time, like Chef Gong, Thatnat is confident his business will be on the right side of the trend. “In the next 10 years, I believe that insect consumption will be more accepted and become normal. When it becomes normal, there will be more sources and farms. I believe that our company won’t be the only one doing this,” he said.\n“Our world has been badly abused by people and our destruction of environments. But insect farming is farming that cares about the environment. Consuming insects will help farmers, help the world and help prolong the life of the planet.”\nAdditional reporting by Ryn Jirenuwat.\n', 'related_topics': ['     agriculture ', '     United Nations ', '     Thailand ', '     food ', '     health ']}"

      Beef noodle soup that's been simmering for 40 years delivers a taste of old Thailand
  </h1>, 'text': ""BANGKOK: A giant pot is brimming with beef – a melt-in-your-mouth selection of cuts that have been stewed for more than 8 hours, with fresh coriander roots and a bag of secret ingredients.\xa0\nThe smell is sweet and rich. Star anise. Cinnamon. Black peppercorns. Garlic. Nearly ten kinds of aromatic Chinese herbs and spices soaked in the dark soup that has been simmering here for\xa0more than 40 years.\xa0\nIt is probably the oldest beef soup in the Thai capital Bangkok, with the\xa0Wattana Panich restaurant\xa0serving countless bowls\xa0for three generations. Despite new eateries cropping up on every side, the business has managed to maintain its spot in the city’s competitive food scene with a long history of dedication, consistency and precision.\xa0\n“We keep tasting. There is no recipe,” said Chinese-Thai owner Nattapong Kaweenuntawong.\nThe 40-year-old works every day, filling bowl after bowl with his family’s legacy – different cuts of beef cooked to perfect tenderness, noodles, garlic oil and the rich, dark soup topped with fresh Chinese celery.\xa0\nEach bowl is an execution of the art of cooking that has taken Nattapong decades to master. He began tasting his family’s soup since a young age and under the expert guidance of his father, learnt how to maintain its perfection.\xa0\n“My father would season the soup and let me taste it. At the beginning, I didn’t really get it but once I started doing it every day, I began to notice when the taste changed. My father would tell me what was lacking,” he said.\n“When we add the stock, the taste changes. The amount of stock we add is also different each time. So, we have to keep tasting and we’ll find out what is missing. Then, we season the soup to taste.”\nCustomers beat Bangkok’s notorious traffic to this old-school shophouse to savour the taste of decades-old culinary heritage, which was first created by Nattapong’s grandfather when he set up a small food stall near the Chao Phraya River nearly 60 years ago.\xa0\xa0\nThe stall was then moved to another location before transforming into a two-storey establishment in Ekamai, central Bangkok, where the soup has been simmering since before Nattapong was born.\xa0\nFor four decades, staff have been using the previous day's soup as the base for the following day's offering.\n“Our soup is collected every day. Each night, when the soup has reduced, we would keep it in a pot and simmer it. We keep it as the stock and use it the following day. We’ve been doing this since we opened the restaurant, which was more than 40 years ago,” he said, adding the current location was like a forest back then.\nThe soup is made from beef bones and meat stewed for hours each day to extract the sweetness. Nattapong said huge chunks of beef are boiled for four hours until they are tender, then cut into bite-sized pieces and stewed for four more hours in the stock before serving.\nAs the soup continues to age, the restaurant’s fame continues to grow. Besides its loyal Thai customers, the business also attracts foreign visitors from around the world.\n“We found out from YouTube about this place, and also some of the online food bloggers that reviewed it. So, we decided to come down to try because I think this broth has been brewing for many, many years. And it’s such a huge pot of goodness. The broth is really, really awesome and the beef is really, really tender,” said Sebastian Lee from Singapore.\n“I had the first sip of the soup and it was very rich with all the things that have been stewed for so long,” he added.\nAccording to Nattapong, most foreign customers are from China, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore and Korea. But in recent years, he has begun to notice more clients from the United States and Europe.\n“Maybe 10-20 years ago, when western tourists came to look at our menu, we knew they’d just walk away. This wasn’t the kind of food they’d want to try,” he said. “But that has changed.”\xa0\nFor him, however, one thing has never changed. His family’s beef soup.\n“Like I said, we keep tasting it. So, the flavour is the same.”\n"", 'related_topics': ['     restaurant ', '     Thailand ', '     food ', '     Bangkok ']}"

      Can we eat meat and still tame global warming?
  </h1>, 'text': 'PARIS:\xa0Not everyone needs to become a vegetarian, much less vegan, to keep the planet from overheating, but it would surely make things easier if they did.\nThat\'s the ambiguous and - for many on either side of this meaty issue -\xa0unsatisfying conclusion of the most comprehensive report ever compiled on the link between climate change and how we feed ourselves, released Thursday (Aug 8) by the United Nations.\nThe core findings are crystal clear: Climate change is threatening the world\'s food supply, even as the way we produce food fuels global warming.\nRising temperatures in tropical zones are starting to shrink yields, displace staple crops, and sap essential nutrients from food plants.\nAt the same time, the global food system - from farm to food court - accounts for at least a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions.\nWith two billion more mouths to feed by mid-century, it cannot simply be scaled up without pushing Earth\'s thermometer deep into the red zone, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) ""special report"".\nMore than a quarter of today\'s food-related emissions come from cattle and sheep.\n""Today\'s IPCC report identifies the enormous impact that our dietary choices have on the environment,"" commented Alan Dangour, a nutrition and global health expert at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.\n""It is clear that reducing the demand for meat in diets is an important approach to lowering the environmental impact of the food system.""\nDOUBLE CLIMATE THREAT\xa0\nThe livestock industry is a double climate threat: It replaces CO2-absorbing forests -\xa0notably in sub-tropical Brazil -\xa0with land for grazing and soy crops for cattle feed. The animals also belch huge amounts of methane, a potent greenhouse gas.\nOn average, beef requires 20 times more land and emits 20 times more greenhouse gases per unit of edible protein than basic plant proteins, notes the World Resources Institute, a Washington-based policy think tank.\nFor all these reasons, the IPCC concludes, gravitating towards ""balanced diets, featuring plant-based foods"" would hugely help the climate change cause.\nThis may sound like a ringing endorsement of vegetarianism, but it doesn\'t necessarily mean the world must, or should, eschew meat altogether, the IPCC said.\nBesides ""coarse grains, legumes, fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds"", that ""balanced diet"" also includes ""animal-sourced food produced in resilient, sustainable and low-greenhouse gas emission systems"", the report concluded.\nThere are likely several reasons the 100-plus authors stopped short of calling for a ban on carbon-intensive red meat.\nTo begin with, calling for anything is not part of their brief.\n""The IPCC does not recommend people\'s diets,"" co-chair Jim Skea, a professor at Imperial College London\'s Centre for Environmental Policy, tweeted in reaction to misleading media stories.\n\'REFERENCE DIET\'\n""What we\'ve pointed out on the basis of scientific evidence is that there are certain diets that have a lower carbon footprint.""\nObservers privy to the week-long meeting, which vets the report summary line-by-line, also note that some scientific findings align better than others with the interests of beef-producing nations.\nIPCC reports are based entirely on published, peer-reviewed research, and this one included thousands of data points.\nBut the final step in a years-long process is approval by diplomats who tussle over how key passages are formulated, including what gets left in or out.\nAnother compelling reason not to espouse a purely plant-based diet is that billions of poor people around the world depend on fish, and to a lesser extent meat, for protein and nutrients that may not be readily available elsewhere.\n""More than 800 million people have insufficient food,"" noted Harvard University\'s Walter Willett, co-commissioner of a landmark study earlier this year in The Lancet proposing a ""reference diet"" for optimal health that is long on veggies, legumes and nuts, and short on meat, dairy and sugar.\nThat diet, The Lancet study found, could feed a world of 10 billion people in 2050 - but only barely.\n""We are suggesting a more balanced diet that has roughly 100g\xa0per person per week of red meat -\xa0a single serving once a week rather than every day,"" co-author Johan Rockstrom, former director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Change Impacts, told AFP.\nMeat consumption has levelled off in rich nations, where fast food chains - including Burger King, McDonald\'s, and this week Subway -\xa0are rushing to offer faux meat alternatives.\nBut globally, consumption of all four major meats - beef, pork, chicken and lamb - are projected to rise slightly over the next five year, according to industry analysts.\n', 'related_topics': ['     climate change ', '     food ']}"

Indeed, at the revamped Culina at COMO Dempsey, it’s not unusual for foodies to run into some familiar faces while they trawl the sleek aisles.\nChefs like Malcolm Lee of neighbouring restaurant Candlenut and Jason Tan from Cornerhouse at the Botanic Gardens (just down the road) have been known to cruise the shelves for easy eats like cold cuts and cheeses when they’re not working.\n“At Candlenut, we use Westholme wagyu in dishes like beef rendang, curries, satays and stir-fries,” said Lee. “But (on my personal trips) to the store, I buy things like wines, cheeses, sausages, fresh herbs and vegetables.”\n\n\nDirector of Food, Beverage and Culinary Operations at the Four Seasons Hotel Singapore, Giovanni Speciale, also heads to the gourmet emporium for ingredients to cook Sunday dinner for his family. “I love the Poussin chicken, which I serve with ratte potatoes and frisee lettuce. I’m always excited to cook with such great produce.”\nWhile private dining chef Lee Yum Hwa is renowned for his rustic, made-from-scratch pastas that would rival an Italian nonna’s, he is not above buying from the impressive range of dried pastas at Culina. But one of his main reasons for shopping there is the speciality range of beef.\nAnd it’s not just the food that draws these cuisiniers. Chef-owner of Firebake – Woodfired Bakehouse & Restaurant, Konstantino Blokbergen comes for the selection of Alain Milliat juices. “Especially the chardonnay and pear nectar flavours. You can really taste the quality and freshness, and the flavour of the fruits. We bring home different flavours each time and introduce them to our friends. We also love serving them with sparkling water for an extra refreshing treat,” he enthused.\nChef Jason Tan’s purchase list for his restaurant may include premium goodies like black truffles from Manjimup in Western Australia and Kaviari caviar, but his personal shopping cart is usually filled with the likes of cold cuts and bubbly.\n“When I have barbecues and house parties to go to, I sometimes pick up a few bottles of champagne for the occasion – Taittinger, in particular, as it goes well with almost any food,” he said. “Also, cold cuts like lardo and 5J Iberico ham are easy options that I really like as they go well with salads and taste great on their own.”\nWhile lazy or, ahem, busy gourmets could put together a sumptuous soiree with the likes of tinned Ortiz tuna and anchovies (another chef favourite), smoked fish and fresh oysters, Tan makes a case for serving up an exquisite dish that requires little more than some top-notch ingredients and steady assembly. This is his recipe for a Wagyu Tartare with Kristal Caviar, with an ingredient list entirely available at Culina. We’ll be right here waiting for our invitation.\nWagyu Tartare with Kristal Caviar\nServes 10\n500g Westholme striploin (marble score 6 to 7)\n200g banana shallots, finely chopped\n1 tsp fleur de sel, or to taste\n50g Alain Milliat tomato ketchup\n50g Dijon mustard\n50g olive oil\n5g sesame oil\n50g chives, finely chopped\n50g Italian parsley, finely chopped\n2 tsp light soy sauce, plus more to taste\n½ tsp ground black pepper, plus more to taste\n100g Kaviari Kristal caviar\n', 'related_topics': ['     Singapore ', '     Chefs ', '     Restaurants ', '     food ', '     Community ']}"

      Chicken rice for the soul: The volunteers giving nursing home seniors a rare chance to eat out
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: It is the weekend.\nAnd while others might be\xa0content enjoying their off-days\xa0in the comfort of air-conditioned shopping centres,\xa0Mdm Tan Lian Hua is having the time of her life\xa0on a sweltering Saturday afternoon at a hawker centre.\nThe 76-year-old\'s memory is foggy - she can\'t always remember the names of people, places and dates.\nBut\xa0when she sees the plate on the table before her, her eyes light up in recognition.\xa0\nIt\'s chicken rice - her favourite.\nA resident of Thong Teck Home for Senior Citizens, Mdm Tan is unable to leave the home on her own to enjoy her favourite meals.\nBut with the help of a group of volunteers from the Jiak Simi (hokkien for \'What are we eating?\') project, she\xa0can.\nFounded by\xa0volunteer Owen Tan in 2016, Jiak Simi\xa0aims to bring seniors to food places which they would otherwise not be able to visit on their own.\n""I started as a food technologist so I worked to develop food for older adults with swallowing difficulties,"" 29-year-old Mr Tan\xa0told CNA. ""So when I was doing this, I thought: For those uncles and aunties who still can eat, why don’t they have the right to choose the food they want? So I decided - why don\'t\xa0I form a small group with my friends and we can bring a small group of aunties and uncles to go hawker centres to eat?""\nThe ability to choose one\'s food is a basic right,\xa0suggested Mr Tan, and he wanted to return that back to the seniors.\n""Being able to choose what you eat is\xa0a right, but in a nursing home ...\xa0you lose the dignity to choose the food that you like,"" he explained.\xa0\xa0""If one day I told\xa0you that you can no longer choose the food that you like, how would you feel?""\nA member of Youth Corps Singapore, Mr Tan had already been volunteering at the\xa0home prior to the setting up of the project.\n""Normally we would go there to\xa0organize Christmas parties, Chinese New Year parties or birthday parties,"" he recalled.\xa0""I had already developed a strong relationship with the home ... So I thought why don’t I open this idea to them - and they were quite open to it.""\nAs part of Youth Corps Leaders Programme, Mr Tan was\xa0given S$2,000 under the Pay It Forward award to kickstart the project.\xa0\xa0He recruited others through the Youth Corp portal, as well as neighbours, polytechnic friends, university friends and working colleagues.\nToday, the group has\xa0over 50 volunteers, with\xa0outings\xa0held once every two months.\nThe group is now self-sustaining. They make use of their own money to charter buses to bring the seniors on outings, and pay for the lunches of the accompanying caregivers.\n""Youth Corps has featured us before so some of the public have gotten\xa0to know us and are aware of us, they don\'t mind contributing money for\xa0the buses,"" said Mr Tan. \xa0""For the food, we encourage the volunteers themselves to treat the residents.\n""Normally the caregivers eat in the home, so if we want them to go out with the volunteers and us, we have to pay for their lunch. They skip their lunch in the home to join us, so its\xa0good for us to ask them to eat lunch together, but we\'ll pay for them.\n""The most important thing is that the home is very supportive – this home is currently providing one caregiver to one resident (on outings) hence if we don’t really get the numbers from the volunteer side, we still can go ahead. Sometimes if the volunteers are busy, if we get eight to 10, we will still proceed.""\nFrom Maxwell Hawker Centre to Jewel Changi Airport,\xa0\xa0Chinatown Complex Food Centre to Changi Village Hawker Centre, the seniors have seen their share - and eaten\xa0their share.\n""We should thank them very much for this,"" said 92-year-old Lee Kim Cheng, who estimates that he has been on three different outings. ""They are so young and doing volunteer work, we should appreciate them because not all young people would volunteer to do this.\n""We are at the home all the time and when there’s somebody to bring you to a new place, you should be thankful.""\nMr Tan is also keen to point out that\xa0the seemingly small action of paying for these seniors\' meals goes a long way.\n""A plate of chicken rice that costs three\xa0dollars can bring so many smiles to the aunties and\xa0uncles,"" he explained. ""Some might say that the people we bring out are\xa0only a few but ... you don’t have to help many people.\xa0\n""If you can help one, then help one. If you can help a few, just help a few.""\n“As we celebrate Youth Corps Singapore’s fifth anniversary this year, I am heartened to see youths like Owen continue to give back to society and engage with the senior citizens,"" chairman for Youth Corps Singapore\'s\xa0advisory committee\xa0Amrin Amin told CNA.\n""Through my interactions with Owen, you can see his passion for volunteerism shining through. We need more youths like him to reach out to the rest of Singapore to make volunteerism a way of life.""\nAnd with meals at the home being vegetarian only, there is\xa0added reason for the seniors\'\xa0cheer when they get to go on outings.\n""I like eating meat, but they don’t serve meat,"" said Mdm Tan with a laugh.\xa0""Any kind of meat will do. Today’s the first day I\'ve\xa0eaten meat this year.\n""I liked everything about today\'s outing\xa0but if I had to choose something I liked the best, it would be the chicken rice. Our stroll to the beach is not going to make me full you know?""\nBut it is not just all about the food - the company of the volunteers remains something the seniors hold very dear.\n""Every time I see them walk through the door, I know it’s a chance to go out. With them here, I’m happy,"" added Mdm Tan.\xa0\n""They have good hearts. When I come back and go back to my room, I will feel\xa0a bit sad and wonder: \'When will be the next time we go out again?\'""\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     food ']}"

      Japanese with a tropical touch: The nikkei food scene in Sao Paulo, Brazil
  </h1>, 'text': 'It is not yet dawn and Ken Mizumoto is inspecting large pieces of fresh tuna and boxes of langoustines. In the manner of sushi chefs, he is obsessive about freshness. This is not Tokyo’s legendary fish market but its counterpart in the gritty downtown area of Sao Paulo, Brazil, a country that has close historical ties to Japan.\n“We do our best to keep the quality as good and the tradition as alive as possible,” said Mizumoto, 39, a second-generation Brazilian Japanese who owns ShinZushi, one of the city’s best sushi restaurants. Brazil’s bars and restaurants association says Sao Paulo has 900 Japanese restaurants, producing more than 500,000 sushi meals a day.\xa0\nBrazil is home to an estimated 1.9 million\xa0nikkei, descendants of Japanese immigrants, giving Brazil the largest population of Japanese origin outside Japan. Most came during the first half of last century. Of the destinations Japanese migrants went to, says Lidia Reiko of Brazil’s museum of Japanese immigration, Brazil “is the one where tradition was better kept”.\nIn ShinZushi, chefs are only allowed to prepare sushi after five years of training. It is a world where the everyday rules and rhythms of Brazil do not apply. People speak softly, Japanese is the lingua franca, precision is paramount.\n“The authenticity of the restaurant is not just food, it is also the way you greet and serve people,” said Mizumoto. “You cannot eat sushi properly if we play samba in the background.”\nIn silence, he and a staff member undergoing instruction from him slice a 15kg imported bluefin tuna. In 2000, Mizumoto moved to Tokyo to learn the art of sushi. After 11 years, his master told him: “You are ready, you can go back to Brazil.”\n\n\nHe took charge of his late father’s restaurant, run by a cousin at the time, who, he was shocked to find, was serving US-style sushi. The menu included things like “salmon stuffed with cream cheese”, he recalled, in tones a Mexican gourmet might use to describe Tex-Mex food: “Unbelievable”.\nTradition is also a theme at Telma Shiraishi’s Aizome restaurant, in an old Japanese-style wooden house in an upscale area of Sao Paulo. To make Japanese cuisine outside of Japan, she says, you need its principles “clear in your mind”. This year, she became the first Brazilian woman to be appointed Japanese Cuisine\xa0Goodwill Ambassador by the Japanese government.\n“Some people say the Japanese spoken here in Brazil is more traditional than that spoken back in Japan and that can also go for the food,” said Yasushi Noguchi, Japan’s consul general to Sao Paulo. But he adds chefs are not averse to mixing Brazilian cuisine in with it.\nIn Sao Paulo’s main Japanese quarter of Liberdade, in\xa0the centre of the city, Wagner Yoshihiro Higuchi pours beers and sakes alike in his izakaya, or pub, Kintaro. A wrestler, he inherited his father’s passion for sumo and his mother’s taste for Japanese pickles,\xa0oden hotpot and breaded pork\xa0tonkatsu.\n“My father liked drinking after wrestling and my mother cooked very well – handy when you own an izakaya,” he said.\xa0\nHiguchi and his brother took over Kintaro a few years ago. Their mother still runs the kitchen. At the back of the bar, downing Kirin beers, a Brazilian-Japanese couple discuss plans to migrate to Tokyo to “escape” Brazil’s economic slowdown and the government of President Jair Bolsonaro. Nearby, two women speaking Japanese munch a portion of\xa0nasu dengaku, miso-glazed eggplant.\xa0\n“We serve things that are very Japanese,” said Higuchi, such as kinpira gobo, or braised burdock root and carrot. He also offers dishes from the “colony” – as the times when the Japanese first settled in Brazil are known – such as marinated sardines. “One way or the other, we try to maintain the tradition,” he added. “Japanese is what we are, but with a tropical touch.”\nBy Andres Schipani © 2019 The Financial Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     Brazil ', '     Japan ', '     Tokyo ', '     food ', '     Fine dining ', '     Restaurants ']}"

      From Chickenjoy to dim sum and now coffee: Jollibee's scrumptious quest for world domination
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: In 1975, a young man named Tony Tan Caktiong opened an ice-cream shop in Manila.\xa0\nThree years later, the Tan Caktiong family\xa0picked\xa0up on a bigger local appetite for hot meals and sandwiches, and Jollibee - a small restaurant\xa0chain serving a Filipino take on fast food\xa0- was born.\nBy early 2019, Jollibee was selling its hot-favourite Chickenjoy and Jolly Spaghetti special\xa0in more than 1,000 restaurants in the Philippines\xa0- beating out Burger King and McDonald\'s in both popularity and market share.\xa0\nBut like its addictive fried chicken bucket, it was just not enough.\xa0\nJollibee Foods, whose founder and chairman is now a billionaire several times over, is on a mission to conquer the world. And with a ballpark of 4,000 stores under 14\xa0brands in 20 countries, it is well on its way.\xa0\nHere is\xa0a timeline of Jollibee\'s rapid (and lip-smacking) climb towards realising its vision of becoming one of the top five restaurant\xa0companies in the world.\xa0\nROAD TO CHINA\nIn January 2016, following a spate of more low-profile acquisitions, Jollibee Foods entered a joint venture to be the exclusive operator of Dunkin\' Donuts in China, reportedly with plans to launch 1,400 stores in the world\'s second-largest economy over 20 years.\xa0\nDIM SUM DEAL\n2018 marked\xa0a major boost in Jollibee\'s international profile, starting with its S$45 million investment in a fund set to become the master franchise holder of Michelin-starred dim sum chain Tim Ho Wan.\nThis means Jollibee now has a substantial stake in the running of all the Tim Ho Wan joints in the region, except in Hong Kong where the restaurant popular for its barbecue pork buns was founded in 2009.\xa0\nSMASHING THE BURGER MARKET\nIn December 2018, Jollibee became the owner of classic American burger brand Smashburger, which has more than 300 outlets across the US, UK and Canada, plus a handful in Saudi Arabia.\xa0\nThe move put the Filipino company in a solid position to compete with big names like Five Guys and Shake Shack in the ""better burger"" segment.\xa0\nGOING MEXICAN\nThat same month, Jollibee put on its sombrero in a bid to challenge the world\'s top fast food operators, investing US$12.4 million (S$16.9 million) for a nearly 50 per cent stake in Tortas Fronterra.\xa0\nThe US Mexican food brand serves pork, beef and chicken sandwiches with sides of guacamole and salsa.\xa0\nJAVA JUMP\nEven with its worldwide, cross-flavour expansion, Jollibee\'s biggest business has always been its namesake Philippine-born brand - but that is set to change with the company\'s US$350 million purchase of US-based specialty coffee and tea chain Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf.\xa0\nIn the\xa0Philippine Stock Exchange filing, Tan Caktiong described the acquisition as Jollibee\'s ""largest and most multinational so far with business presence in 27 countries"" - giving the Jollibee vision a massive caffeine boost.\n', 'related_topics': ['     dining ', '     food ']}"

      Foodie Capitol: 6 dining venues to check out at The Capitol Kempinski
  </h1>, 'text': 'If you’ve sauntered past Capitol Building or Capitol Piazza recently, and noticed an inordinate amount of hoardings, that’s because the mall is undergoing a tenant refresh. Don’t be put off by this state of flux, however; there are actually a host of new (and upcoming) f&b offerings, particularly in the arcade connecting Capitol Building and The Capitol Kempinski. Here are six venues that are already open and well worth checking out.\nCASUAL, BUT CLASSY\nChannelling the timeless elegance of a classic 19th-century European cafe, Berthold Delikatessen, with its dark wood panelled walls, black-and-white tiled floors, marble-topped tables, smartly-aproned staff, and gleaming glass-fronted counters piled high with sandwiches, pies, cakes, quiches and tarts, is the ideal pitstop for a fuss-free lunch or coffee break.\nOur perfect bistro meal here would start with a Waldorf or beetroot salad, followed by either the charcoal brioche with chicken or smoked salmon, or the dark rye sourdough with pastrami rye, and a decadent fruit tart or slice of Black Forest cake. Washed down with a cup of German-blend java, of course. For a spot of people-watching, head up to the mezzanine level, or choose a table the sheltered alfresco area underneath a row of soaring palm trees.\nWe’d prefer to linger here for a chat with a friend, or even alone with our journals and laptops. But if you’re in a rush, you can always grab something to go.\nBerthold Delikatessen, #01-84 Arcade@The Capitol Kempinski\nRETROLICIOUSLY DELICIOUS\nWhether you’re a #Instafoodie hipster, a parent trying to entice your picky rugrat to a meal, or taking someone from the Merdeka/Pioneer generation out – or doing all three at once – Capitol Milk Bar should lead to smiles all round. The retro all-American-themed diner is a recreation of the famous Magnolia Snack Bar that called the old Capitol Building home in the 1960s.\nNeon signs, vintage posters, formica-topped tables, vinyl-upholstered seating, mosaic-tiled floors, and oversized glass jars filled with colourful candies (which you can buy by weight) evoke cheery nostalgia, while the menu of hotdogs, burgers, sandwiches, milkshakes and sundaes reflects a refined, contemporary approach to typical diner fare.\nFor example, The Capitol sandwich features pulled pork, arugula, pickled cucumber, yuzu cabbage slew and apple butter barbecue sauce, while The Sir Douglas Fairbanks is a focaccia roll with smoked salmon, preserved lemon gel, cucumber apple yoghurt and pistachio cream cheese. And the beef patties used in the burgers (yes, even the kids’ burgers) come from Black Angus cows, no less.\nThe jumbo version of the Rio Rita hotdog, comprising a 1m-long spicy beef sausage topped with arugula, chili con carne, mozzarella cheese and tomato salsa is particularly Insta-worthy, and best shared with at least one other hungry dining companion, because you NEED to save room for dessert. For example, the Capitol Milk Bar Banana Split upgrades your favourite childhood treat of vanilla, chocolate and strawberry ice cream and banana – except here, the banana is “split” in a more creative manner: Think caramelised banana raisin, banana vanilla espuma, freeze dried banana and banana rum glaze.\nThe pretty milk shakes served in tall, curvy retro glasses are another must-try –\xa0 chocaholics should definitely gun for the Dinosaur, which comes fully loaded with marshmallow, malt balls, chocolate Pocky and a generous heap of cocoa powder.\nCapitol Milk Bar, #01-84B\xa0 Arcade@The Capitol Kempinski\nGREEN, GIRLY, GORGEOUS … AND GERMAN\nMost of us associate German food with raucous beer halls in dark, dank, wood-beamed basements. Frieda, with its sophisticated botanical-themed decor and reinterpretation of traditional German fare with Austrian influences, makes for a truly refreshing counterpoint.\nDivided into four different spaces, Frieda’s Daybar, which is inspired by urban-chic Berlin, serves up German liquors, and German beers on tap – look out for the happy hour deals! Frieda’s Garden, a sun-dappled covered al fresco space accented with hanging potted plants and conservatory-inspired glass and wrought-iron outdoor furniture, is perfect for girly gatherings (order the platter of grilled sausages and meatloaf to graze on); The Pantry’s open kitchen offers an interactive experience with the chefs, while the Dining Room, with its sage-green velvet booth seats and beautiful floral wallpaper-accented wall panels, sets the tone for a romantic evening.\nThe food here aims to be as good as what your grandma would make, if she were German. Think crispy on the outside, tender on the inside Oven Roasted Pork Knuckle, slow-cooked in an aromatic pork stock with bay leaves, peppercorns, cloves, juniper berries, garlic and onion for three hours, served alongside pretzel dumplings, and house-made sauerkraut. Or perfectly breaded wiener schnitzel with potato salad, cucumber-dill salad and cranberry sauce. For lighter fare, options such as Pretzel Dumplings with Creamy Mushroom Ragout, or Pan-fried rainbow trout with roasted almonds, baby leaf spinach and parley potatoes, are available.\nFrieda, Unit 01-87, 01-K1-K2 Arcade @ The Capitol Kempinski\nTEATIME FOR TAITAIS\nNot all of us can be full-time taitais, but every so often, we can certainly pretend to be one for an afternoon. Grab a girlfriend (or three) and head for the discreet luxury of Capitol Kempinski’s Lobby Lounge, where plush armchairs, soothing live music (either by a harpist, violin trio or pianist, depending on the day) and a fashion showcase accompany five-course high tea. Dainty nibbles like Chicken Rice Arancini, Crab Quiche and Smoked Duck and Cantaloupe Cornet with Thai Dressing, Prawn Salad with mango salsa, cranberry scones served with caramelised passionfruit chocolate jam, raspberry yuzu meringue tarts are accompanied by five types of tea. The Lobby Lounge’s High Tea set (served from 3pm to 6pm daily) is priced at S$58++ with tea pairing, and S$78++ with tea pairing and two glasses of champagne.\nreservation.15stamford [at] kempinski.com ()\nDARK, HANDSOME AND SEXY\nIf your Cuba trip is still a distant pipe dream, The Bar at 15 Stamford is THE place to drown your sorrows over Singapore’s largest selection of rum – a whopping 160, to be exact. If rum’s not your poison, there are also more than 250 wines, and other spirits (even absinthe), on offer as well.\nDark, handsome and sexy, the Jaya Ibrahim-designed space simply oozes vintage glamour heavily tinged with tropical exoticism. A long wood-topped bar counter, bedecked in colourful tilework and accented by rattan-backed stools, leads into the parquet-floored lounge area, where mahogany-toned armchairs and caramel-hued leather banquettes beckon one to cosy up and unwind.\nSip on some of the world’s rarest rums, such as Silver Seal Fine Caroni Heavy Rum 1997 Wildlife series No. 2 from Trinidad’s famed (and long closed) Caroni Distillery, or peruse the cocktail menu (which comes in a charming leather bound scroll) for libations featuring gin, pisco, vermouth, cachaca and of course rum, created by Senior Head Bartender Edriane Sherwyn Lim, whose last port of call was the famed Atlas Grand Lobby and Bar.\nSpeaking of ports of call, fascinate your date or drinking kakis with trivia pertinent to the bar’s historic location. For example, Joseph Balestier, the first appointed US Consul to Singapore in 1836 (and yes, the road is named after him), lived with his wife and son in a bungalow at the junction of Stamford and North Bridge Roads. An avid horticulturalist, he had a pineapple and sugarcane plantation, and even distilled his own rum!\nThat’s assuming you can keep your facts straight after imbibing the bar’s signature cocktail, the Plantation 1840 – incorporating Black Tears Rum, sweet vermouth, pineapple juice, sugarcane juice, lemon juice and mint, it’s served in a pretty copper mug and almost goes down too easily, but packs a surprisingly strong kick. Better line your stomach with some bar snacks, such as the fish tartare, which features gojuchang-dressed tuna, avocado and tomato in crispy nori shells shaped using kueh pie tee moulds, or beef short rib rendang sliders.\nVerdict: We’ll drink to this 80-seater watering hole that’s intimate enough for a hot date, classy enough for after-work drinks with clients you need to impress, and roomy enough to accommodate bigger groups.\nThe Bar at 15 Stamford, The Capitol Kempinski Hotel Singapore\nASIAN WITH A TWIST\nDesigned to evoke the sense of a multi-faceted Asian kitchen, Capitol Kempinski’s 150-seater flagship eatery 15 Stamford by Alvin Leung serves up an All-Asian menu alongside steak house classics.\nHeadlined by the chef behind three Michelin-starred Hong Kong eatery Bo Innovation, Leung pays tribute to his favourite Asian dishes from Korea, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Hong Kong, the Philippines and Singapore, but with a refined, imaginative twist.\nAs such, the laksa comes with char-grilled tiger prawns, jasmine tea-smoked onsen quail eggs and house-made dried shrimp floss; bak kut teh is reinvented as a chargrilled pork chop marinated in herbal spices, and accompanied with angelica-infused watermelon and a bak kut teh-infused barbecue sauce; Chili Crab features Alaskan King Crab instead of the Sri Lankan mud crab that’s normally used. Other new ways with familiar tastes include Malaysia-inspired 72 hour US Short Ribs Rendang with picked cabbage (the beef chunks are cooked sous-vide in rendang marinade), and traditional Hong Kong dessert Mango Pomelo Sago with Coconut Snow presented in the form of ice kachang.\nIf you or your dining companions prefer something from the customised wood and charcoal grill that takes pride of place in the open kitchen, 15 Stamford offers premium cuts, such as A5 Japanese Wagyu Beef Striploin or MBS 3-4 Australian Tomahawk, and seafood such as whole Boston lobster and tiger prawns, perfectly seared on the outside and juicy inside, accompanied by Asian-inspired sauces such as Thai Hollandaise or Laksa Leaf Chimichurri.\nWe’d come here for business lunches, or with guests from out-of-town who want a taste of Asia, but are not quite ready to brave Newton Circus food centre or zi char restaurants.\n15 Stamford by Alvin Leung, The Capitol Kempinski Hotel Singapore\n', 'related_topics': ['     food ', '     Restaurants ', '     Singapore ', '     Capitol ', '     Fine dining ']}"

      Where Singapore’s top chefs go for their favourite hawker fix
  </h1>, 'text': 'You know the chefs behind some of your most memorable restaurant meals, but have you ever wondered what tickles their fancy when they\'re out for a quick lunch fix or a fuss-free dinner with the family? We did, so we checked in with the culinary maestros\xa0on their ultimate hawker delights.\n\n\nBEPPE DE VITO, CHEF-RESTAURANTEUR, IL LIDO GROUP\n“Bak kut teh is food for the soul, and is for me the ultimate Singaporean comfort food. It’s a family favourite and our ritual supper food we often (have) with our friend, chef Tetsuya.\xa0\xa0\nOld Tiong Bahru Bak Kut Teh is my long-time go-to spot and in my opinion, serves the best bak kut teh in Singapore. Their broth recipe is simple yet incredibly balanced and flavoursome, and is prepared fresh daily, which is something I always look for in a quality dish. They will simmer the pork ribs with garlic and pepper which coaxes the meat to help extract the natural flavour out of the bones and meat, to give the dish a pleasant sweetness.\nTheir bak kut teh is best enjoyed with youtiao, a traditional Chinese doughnut-like pastry which is perfect, as it soaks up all the rich flavours of the broth.”\nOld Tiong Bahru Bak Kut Teh | 58 Seng Poh Road, S(160058) | 6223 3075\nDAVE PYNT, CHEF-OWNER, BURNT ENDS\n“One of my favourite hawker foods is the chilli crab from Sin Hoi Sai Seafood Restaurant, recommended by one of our staff. It’s such a quintessential Singaporean dish where you get one whole succulent and meaty crab bathed in a luscious sauce made with tomato, chilli and egg.\nWhat makes this special is that it’s a large format dish you eat with your hands – and share with friends. You also get these deep-fried pillowy mantou buns you dip into the sauce with bits of crab in it. It’s one of the best bites ever!”\nSin Hoi Sai Seafood Restaurant\xa0| 01-59, 55 Tiong Bahru Road, S(160055) | 6223 0810\nMALCOLM LEE, CHEF-OWNER, CANDLENUT\xa0\n“I just love a good plate of curry rice loaded with deep fried pork chop, braised pork belly, curry chicken wing, stewed cabbage, braised tofu puff and bean sprout.\nAt Scissors Curry Rice, the stall owner still uses the traditional scissors to cut the ingredients – you can actually hear the \'click clack\' cutting sounds as he does this. He then tops it with a sticky gooey curry sauce,\xa0lor bak\xa0and chilli sauce. When everything is mixed together, it’s the ultimate glorious combination – a plate of messy greatness.”\nScissors Cut Curry Rice | 229 Jalan Besar, S(208905) | 9826 1464\nRISHI NALEENDRA, CHEF-OWNER, CHEEK BISTRO “I chanced upon this gem, Tai Hwa Pork Noodle, as it\'s located beneath my apartment block. They serve delicious bak chor mee, a combination of noodles and minced pork which, at first, may seem straightforward. But once it’s tossed with vinegar, chilli, lard, salted fish as well as spring onions and shiitake mushrooms, the dish is filled with waves of umami.”\nHill Street Tai Hwa Pork Noodle | 01-12, 466 Crawford Lane, S(190466)\nJASON TAN, CHEF-OWNER, CORNER HOUSE\n“Eating tutu kueh always gives me a sense of nostalgia... I remember when I was young how I would patiently wait for my parents to come home with my favourite food. I love this steamed rice cake for its lightness and fluffiness, and the delicious filling of either coconut or peanut.”\nTan’s Tutu Coconut Cake | 22B Havelock Road, S(162022) | 9737 2469\nSHIGERU KOIZUMI, CHEF-OWNER, ESORA\n“Prawn mee is a favourite of mine as the broth is incredibly rich with flavours of prawn and pork, incorporated from long hours of boiling. It’s a seemingly simple dish but holds such deep flavours and is almost reminiscent of a ramen broth. I go to Blanco Court Prawn Mee on Beach Road to get my fill. The stall is actually next to The Lo & Behold Group headquarters, and that’s how I stumbled across it.”\nBlanco Court Prawn Mee | 01-01, 243 Beach Road, S(189754) | 6396 8464\nKIRK WESTAWAY, CHEF DE CUISINE, JAAN\n“My favourite hawker food is egg prata with mutton curry, especially the one served at Akbar 24 Hours Restaurant below my apartment in Tanjong Pagar. The mutton curry is made with a wonderful medley of spices and is so fragrant; it pairs very well with the prata that’s soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. It’s my go-to meal in the morning before I head to the restaurant.”\nAkbar 24 Hours Restaurant | 2 Lim Teck Kim Road, S(088933)\nTIM LAM, HEAD CHEF, JIANG-NAN CHUN\n“Satay is relatively inexpensive yet enjoyed by many for its power-packed flavours. A variety of spices are used to marinate the meat, which is then (skewered and) grilled over charcoal for a nice smoky layer while the meat remains juicy. It’s best to have satay when you\'re (dining) with a group of people. Whenever I have guests from overseas, I bring them out for a ‘satay night’ at Lau Pa Sat.”\nLau Pa Sat Stall 7/8 | 18 Raffles Quay, S(048582) | 6220 2138\n\n\nHAN LI GUANG, CHEF-OWNER, LABYRINTH\n“I have a lot of favourite hawker foods because I grew up eating them, but one that stands out is bak chor mee. The seemingly simple fishball noodle dish has a luxe mouthfeel that’s elevated with the piquant flavours of the vinegar.\xa0 When I crave this for breakfast, I often go to Tai Wah Pork Noodle – which shouldn’t be confused with the Michelin-starred Hill Street Tai Hwa Pork Noodle.\nThe owners are brothers who used to run a stall at Marina Square, until they split up and set up their own business – but they have the same delicious recipe. The best thing about Tai Wah Pork Noodle is that there’s often no queue.""\nTai Wah Pork Noodle | Block 153A Cross Street, 02-16 Hong Lim Food Centre, S(051531) | 9182 8881\nVIOLET OON, CHEF-OWNER, NATIONAL KITCHEN BY VIOLET OON\n“I love the Hokkien\xa0kuan chiang\xa0(pink Hokkien sausage) best because it’s made using quality ingredients without any shortcuts, plus there are only a few stalls in Singapore that prepare this the authentic way.\nThe precise method to make this is to wash and boil the pig’s small intestines first until the offal smell is gone. The transparent skin is stuffed with the likes of lean pork chunks and cooked paste of sweet potato flour, and then steamed – similar to how you make a German sausage. Completing the offering is a light pink paste of cooked sweet potato flour lightly flavoured with secret ingredients and a plain chilli sauce made with chilli powder, vinegar and salt.\nA genuine kuan chiang hawker dish includes a few other items like ngoh hiang, bean curd, fish balls, century egg and Hokkien plain fried bee hoon.”\nChina Street Fritters | 01-64, Maxwell Food Centre 1 Kadayanallur Street, S(069184)\xa0\nJULIEN ROYER, CHEF-OWNER, ODETTE\n“I love the smokiness, the unique \'wok hei\' of a good char kway teow. I frequent this place at Zion Road, which my local chef-friend William Tan recommended to me.”\nNo. 18 Zion Road Fried Kway Teow | 01-17 Zion Riverside Food Centre, 70 Zion Road, S(247792)\nTOMOO KIMURA, CHEF-OWNER, SUSHI KIMURA\n“Hainanese chicken rice is an amazing dish that’s simple and tasty. I am a fan of the natural flavours of the chicken, which come with a thin layer of jelly between the skin and meat. Eating this with steaming (hot) fragrant rice that’s cooked in chicken stock and other necessary ingredients is my definition of a heart-warming meal. I usually save some of the chicken skin and enjoy it with chopped scallions and ice cold beer.”\nWee Nam Kee Chicken Rice Restaurant | 01-08, 101 Thomson Road, S(307591) |\xa06255 6396\nTETSUYA WAKUDA, CHEF-OWNER, WAKU GHIN BY TETSUYA WAKUDA\n“A personal favourite of mine is the Old Tiong Bahru Bak Kut Teh, which I usually enjoy for breakfast when I am in Singapore. It is a very authentic local dish that is well-prepared by the owners, and the side dishes also complement the soup nicely. I love the experience of being in a local coffee shop located in an old neighbourhood in Singapore.”\nOld Tiong Bahru Bak Kut Teh |\xa001-31,\xa0Block 58 Seng Poh Road, S(160058) | 6223 3075\nSUN KIM, CHEF-OWNER, META\n“Eating the various types of roasted meats with rice reminds me of my staple food back when I was in Korea. Char siu is one of my favourite meats as it’s sweet, caramelised and nicely balanced with the savoury taste of the pork. The layers of fat make it so soft and tender; it goes extremely well with rice and chilli sauce.\nI discovered Foong Kee\'s when Meta was still under renovation, and I’d visit (the place) every day as it’s just nearby.”\nFoong Kee Coffee Shop | 6 Keong Saik Road, S(089114) | 9181 1451\nIVAN BREHM, CHEF-OWNER, NOURI\n“Laksa reminds me a lot of the flavours I grew up with in Brazil.

      Love uni? Eat your fill of sea urchin in an Italian restaurant for a change
  </h1>, 'text': 'Chef Carlo Marengoni isn’t particularly fond of sea urchin, or ricci di mare as it’s known in Italian. He’s from Bergamo, a landlocked city about an hour’s drive northeast of Milan in the foothills of the Italian Alps. The Chef de Cuisine of The Fullerton Hotel’s The Lighthouse Restaurant & Rooftop Bar is much more accustomed to the rich, earthy, robust dishes of the north: Porcini, polenta, stuffed ravioli and truffles.\n\n\nYet he knows all too well the dining habits of Singaporeans, having made the island his home for the past 24 years (he’s also married to a Singaporean). That knowledge – of Singaporeans’ love affair with the spiky marine creature – inspired Marengoni to come up with a special urchin-focused menu that will be available for a limited time only.\nCalled Chef Marengoni’s Signature Sea Urchin Specials, the four-course menu (S$148++ for lunch or dinner) is a gastronomic journey designed to send uni lovers into seventh heaven. Oops, pardon us – uni is the Japanese term that has been appropriated into local parlance, thanks to its ubiquity in Japanese cuisine.\n“I’m trying to let people know that you can also have sea urchin in an Italian restaurant,” Marengoni told CNA Luxury during a tasting ahead of the menu’s launch. Indeed, the harvesting of urchins is as much an Italian tradition as it is Nipponese, although for obvious reasons the Mediterranean-facing southerners are its strongest advocates.\nThe menu is available from July 5 to July 26, 2019, July marking the start of the harvest season in Puglia, the region best known for ricci di mare. The traditional way to eat it is to dip fresh, homemade bread straight into the halved creature’s creamy centre. “The bread is already very tasty, and with the sea urchin, you don’t need other flavours,” explained chef.\nAnother popular option is to toss it into a simple pasta dish. The restaurant already has one such dish on its regular menu, Fresh Sea Urchin Gragnano Spaghetti, which has been a hit with customers.\n\n\nThe dish is reprised in the seasonal menu – where it forms the second course – and was a clear favourite at the table. Tossed with a rich sauce of garlic, anchovies and bottarga, this traditional pairing is enjoyed throughout Puglia, Sicily and Sardinia. Marengoni used dry pasta rather than egg pasta, the perfectly al dente noodles providing the requisite firmness and bite in contrast to the velvety urchin.\nIt must be noted that Marengoni used a Japanese variety for the tasting, although there is little difference in taste between the two. The most obvious distinction is the colour: Ricci di mare tends towards deep orange and red tones, whereas uni ranges from pale yellows to light oranges (and even purples).\nTo backtrack a little, the starter course: Hokkaido Scallop Carpaccio was paired with Sea Urchin, dusted with seaweed powder, and zested with lime. The delicate, briny flavours of this oceanic duo set the stage for the rest of the tasting.\nAs to why the menu doesn’t offer, say, a starter of bruschetta or house-made bread and urchin – to introduce the traditional pairing to local diners – Marengoni explained: “It could be considered too simple. [Maybe it would work] as an amuse bouche, but as an appetiser, [guests would feel that] it’s too simple – they could do it at home.”\nFor the third course, diners can choose to savour a dish from the land or the sea: Either the Half Naked Boston Lobster (less salacious than it sounds) or the Veal Tenderloin. The former was dressed with a house-made urchin sauce, served with a side of turnip greens, and garnished with freshly shaved truffle. The latter was bathed in the same sauce, and came with a side of asparagus and a sprinkle of house-made porcini powder.\nWe sampled both options, and found the lobster to be a tad overcooked, although it did provide ample bite, (once again) a counterpoint to the custardy urchin texture. The veal, meanwhile, was fork-tender and pleasantly savoury, working well as a fleshy base for the urchin.\nTo cleanse the palate, the tasting concluded with Marengoni’s take on a traditional lemon-centric dessert from the Amalfi coast: Lemon Delight with Amalfi Lemon Custard, Lemon Sorbet and Limoncello. Pro tip: Do as we did and order a shot of Limoncello liqueur to round off the experience. You won’t regret it.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Restaurants ', '     food ', '     hotel ', '     Fine dining ']}"

      Singapore Food Festival returns with LiHO avocado kopi and Ya Kun Pocky 
  </h1>, 'text': ""Avocado kopi, a vegan food crawl and the ultimate chilli crab ramen – these are some of the things food lovers can look forward to at the upcoming Singapore Food Festival (SFF).\nThe annual celebration of local cuisine is back for its 26th year with the theme “Savour Singapore in every bite”. The event is dedicated to local cuisine and talent, celebrating the country’s multicultural heritage.\nTwenty event partners have come together to offer a myriad of dining concepts and gastronomic experiences during the festival that will run from Jul 12 to 28.\nThe food festival's main event, STREAT, will be back. The two-day event\xa0will offer\xa0a range of traditional hawker fare and mod-sin interpretations of Singapore street food from 12 eateries.\nHighlights include duck rice bento from Jin Ji Teochew Braised Duck and Kway Chap, chicken rice kueh pie tee from Salted & Hung, as well as\xa0an Impossible Burger and Fat Papas collaboration.\nDiners will also be entertained by local music acts Charlie Lim and Glen Wee, and have the opportunity to attend workshops and masterclasses by local culinary talents.\nSTREAT\xa0will kick off from 5pm on Jul 12 at The Promontory @ Marina Bay.\nMODERNITY, CULTURE, TRADITION AND ART: HIGHLIGHTS\nVendors at the Singapore Food Festival will be grouped into four different categories -\xa0Modernity, Culture, Tradition and Art.\nHere's a taste of what diners can look forward to:\n1. The Ultimate Chilli Crab Ramen by Ippudo x No Signboard Seafood (Modernity)\nThis may be a fan favourite - the\xa0Ultimate Chilli Crab Ramen was dreamed up\xa0by Japanese ramen chain Ippudo and famous seafood restaurant No Signboard. The dish\xa0brings together\xa0tonkotsu ramen broth\xa0with No Signboard's signature chilli crab sauce, giving it a spicy and savoury kick.\xa0\nThe Ultimate Chilli Crab Ramen's noodles, which have a\xa0springy texture,\xa0are\xa0customised for the dish - which also comes with toppings such as an umami egg, a whole crab claw and fried mantou.\xa0\nOnly 30\xa0bowls of this special\xa0ramen dish will be served\xa0every day at two Ippudo outlets - Mandarin Gallery and Marina Bay Sands -\xa0and it will be available in the month of July.\xa0\n2. Avocado Kopi by LiHo\nBubble tea lovers can pick up an\xa0avocado kopi from selected LiHO outlets.\xa0\nThe new concoction blends the sweet and creamy avocado flavour with a nutty and chocolatey brew, resulting in a smooth and\xa0flavour-packed beverage. It will be available at selected LiHo outlets from Jul 12 to Sep 20, 2019.\xa0\nThis is the first time that LiHo is participating in the Singapore Food Festival, along with\xa07-Eleven and Glico. Glico is also going local, with\xa0a limited edition Pocky x Ya Kun Kaya Toast & Kopi O.\n3. Sor Hei by Project Plait X Artistry (Art)\nWhat does dance have to do with food?\nWell, as part of the art category,\xa0chef Nixon Low and dancer Naomi Tan are coming together to create a unique experience for diners by combining a five-dish menu with a contemporary dance exhibition, named The Mem's Servants.\xa0\nThis\xa0will be held in four interconnected rooms in a black-and-white colonial house near Mount Faber, where diners are required to enter different rooms for each dish.\xa0\nOne of the dishes featured\xa0is called Sor Hei. It's\xa0chilled squid ink pasta with smoked golden trout, giving diners a subtle tinge of flavour past the slightly salty squid ink. It is complemented with golden tobiko (flying fish roe), cauliflower puree and pickled carrots to set up a complex but flavourful dish.\xa0\n4. Jimami Tofu 5D Experience by Cookyn Ink (Art)\nAnother unique dining experience can be found in\xa0Jimami Tofu 5D Dining Experience by Cookyn Inc.\xa0\nDrawing inspiration from the\xa0award-winning 2017 Singaporean-Japanese drama film Jimami Tofu, Cookyn Inc will prepare a seven-course dinner menu for diners, all of which are prepared and served at the same time the movie is being screened.\nThe idea is to provide an all-round experience, allowing diners to use their five senses.\nJimami tofu - naturally - is one of the dishes, along with sweet potato croquette. Both are of Okinawan origin, with the Jimami tofu, a mixture of tapioca and quinoa, having a smooth, sticky and glutinous rice ball-esque texture with sweetened soy sauce.\nThe croquettes, on the other hand, are quite the\xa0opposite -\xa0crispy on the outside and pasty on the inside with finely hand-grated sweet potato.\nDiners can also look forward to taking pictures with the chefs and cast of the movie.\xa0\n5. Mutton Keema from Indian Restaurants Association (Tradition) \nFeaturing authentic Indian dishes from the 1960s,\xa0Campbell Lane in Little India will be opened up to host this year’s Great Indian Food Festival from Jul 19 to 28. This is a collaboration between\xa0the Indian Restaurants Association Singapore (IRAS) and Singapore Tourism Board (STB).\xa0\nOne of the highlights is\xa0Mutton Keema, essentially minced mutton with\xa0Indian breads ranging from naan, chapati, coin prata and a normal-sized prata.\nThe meat, delicate yet juicy, comes with soft potatoes and peas. The thick gravy adds a spicy final touch to the Keema, due to the fragrant herbs used in its creation.\xa0\nThe Indian Food Festival will include 16 food carts along Campbell Lane, allowing visitors to experience Singapore’s heritage through\xa0food.\nOTHER EVENTS\nVegans - heads up. The Singapore Vegan Food Crawl will take diners to Chinatown, Geylang Serai and Little India to discover the booming vegan street food culture, while the Singapore Tea Festival from Jul 19 to 21 will bring a curated line-up of artisanal teas, workshops and snack brands for the perfect teatime experience.\nFestival-goers can also look forward to The Mem’s Servants from Jul 24 to 27, a unique five-course food and contemporary dance experience that’ll bring to life untold stories from the cooks and amahs (nannies) who served at black-and-white colonial houses.\xa0\nRanita Sundramoorthy, Director of Retail and Dining, Singapore Tourism Board, said: “With this year’s robust line-up of events, from private chef dinners and food tours around our heritage districts, to theatrical dining experiences – Singaporeans and visitors will be able to taste Singapore’s diverse flavours and experience our food obsession first-hand.”\nShe added: “In its 26th year, the Festival continues to be a highlight on the Singapore foodie calendar. SFF is a compelling testament to the richness and diversity of our food scene, further cementing our city-state’s reputation as a global culinary capital.”\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Singapore ', '     Trending ', '     food ']}"

      What to eat in Barcelona: A food lover’s guide to the city's culinary delights
  </h1>, 'text': 'Barcelona makes eating all day easy, and for many food lovers, a visit to the Catalan capital can be considered a pilgrimage. While the splendid architecture, rich history and golden beaches are enthralling, few cities can rival its gastronomic delights, which range from humble tapas bars to Michelin champions and everything in between.\xa0\xa0\n\n\nGRANJA PETITBO \nThis sunny corner cafe is the perfect place to head to if you wake up feeling peckish, and especially if the nearby Sagrada Familia and Arc de Triomf are on your agenda for the day. High ceilings, cracked leather armchairs, and vintage reclaimed wood tables invite diners to feel right at home, and it’s just the type of place you can find yourself staying all day. The reasonably priced menu offers a well-rounded selection of all-day dishes, all of which are prepared with locally sourced organic ingredients, and the restaurant’s coffee, homemade cakes, eggs in all shapes and forms, pancakes and sandwiches will not disappoint.\ngranjapetitbo.com\nBAR LA PLATA\nThis corner bar just a block away from the old fishing port has been serving the same four dishes since 1945 – salted anchovies on bread,\xa0butifarra\xa0(a Catalan sausage), tomato salad and their famous floured and fried crispy sardines. Now run by the founder’s grandson, the tiny space packs a ton of atmosphere per square metre with its stunning Spanish-tiled walls and lively crowds. Locals stand shoulder-to-shoulder with their elbows parked on the main bar, and during prime hours it’s not uncommon to see people spilling out onto the streets with glasses in hand. This is the ideal pre-tapas spot, with exceptional vermouth and red, white or rose from the Penedes region served straight out of the barrel in\xa0chupito\xa0glasses.\nbarlaplata.com\xa0\nBAR CANETE\nDespite its regular appearance in Barcelona food guides, Bar Canete has consistently maintained its reputation as a reliable restaurant among locals. If you play your cards right and show up at or after 9pm (Spanish time for dinner), you’ll be surrounded by diners conversing in Catalan. Ask to be seated at the bar for the best experience, especially if you wish to be entertained by what goes down in the kitchen. The menu consists of classic tapas executed with high attention to detail, and while prices tend to be higher than neighbouring tapas bars, the quality and taste of the food justify all.\nbarcanete.com\xa0\n\n\nBAR DEL PLA\nIf you ask any Barcelonian for a list of their favourite tapas restaurants, it’s more than likely that Bar del Pla will come up on top. And rightfully so. The service is warm, the ambience is laid-back, the food is top quality, and the prices are affordable. From the outside, the humble restaurant may not convince you that a standout meal awaits, but little convincing is needed once you’re seated with a glass of wine in hand. The menu covers unique twists on tapas you may already be familiar with, and must-order dishes include squid ink croquettes, octopus bombs and oxtail with foie gras.\nbardelpla.cat\nTICKETS\nThis is a restaurant you make a reservation at before you book your flight to Barcelona. It’s that good, and it’s that difficult to score a table. Tickets is the brainchild of Albert and Ferran Adria, the masterminds behind world-renowned elBulli, and is considered by many to be one of the best restaurants in the world. The interior of the restaurant is anything but modest, with its theatrical lights and poppy colours, and the food works in tandem with the decor. The restaurant describes its tapas as, “fun and vanguard,” introducing molecular gastronomy to traditional Spanish tapas. Reservations open up two months in advance, but be prepared to load up the reservations site on every device in your vicinity to increase your chances of landing a golden ticket.\nelbarri.com\xa0\nMERCADO DE LA BOQUERIA\nFun fact: There are roughly forty markets in Barcelona, with one in almost every neighbourhood. The most famous of all is La Boqueria, situated right off the buzzing La Rambla boulevard. While its prime location may make it feel like somewhat of a tourist trap, the market continues to be the respected destination of choice for the city’s renowned chefs, who arrive early to get first dibs on produce. In addition to stalls selling fresh produce and dried goods, the market is teeming with some of the city’s best tapas bars. El Quim de la Boqueria is highly regarded for its signature dish of baby squid with eggs, and Bar Pinotxo’s chickpeas with blood sausage is a dish to write home about.\nboqueria.barcelona\n', 'related_topics': ['     food ', '     gastronomy ', '     Restaurants ', '     Barcelona ', '     Spain ']}"

      Where to eat in Bangkok: From Michelin-starred stalwarts to exciting upstarts
  </h1>, 'text': 'A place where an unabashed passion for eating unites virtually all its citizens, Bangkok has long prided itself on its reputation as a culinary Mecca. And that status was further bolstered in 2018 when Michelin launched its first Thailand guide.\nPioneers such as Nahm, Bo.Lan, Paste, Le Du and Issaya Siamese Club have long been influential in applying significant tweaks to the upscale Thai dining experience in the Kingdom’s capital.\nBut the arrival of the French fine dining bible has helped a fresh crop of Thai chefs reserve seats at the very top table of the city’s fine dining scene. This phalanx of exciting upstarts includes Michelin star winners Saawaan and Sorn and future near-certs 80/20 and Front Room. All four of which benefit from the cooking skills of Thais.\nTheir boundary-burning flair is indicative of a dining scene that is finally providing a stage for gifted Thai tyros to push the limits of their native cuisine – and also to branch out in new directions. For diners eating at the cutting edge of Bangkok’s fine dining scene, this divergence from tradition is a delicious one.\n\n\n80/20 \nThey tend to do things a little differently in Bangkok’s older quarters.\nHere, in the warren of streets flanking the Chao Phraya River, the roost is ruled by characterful shophouses and markets where stallholders peddle everything from pirated Cantonese blue movies to People’s Republic ephemera.\nGiven the area\'s individualism, it provides a fitting home for 80/20: One of Bangkok’s most adventurous dining venues where Napol “Joe” Jantraget and his Japanese partner Saki Hoshino – the restaurant’s creative driving forces – mastermind multi-course epics that include numerous curveballs.\nIndeed, the experimental bent at 80/20 is exemplified by an on-site science laboratory and test kitchen where glass jars filled with weird and wonderful local ingredients are pickled, fermented and marinated and new recipes developed or discarded.\nExamples of their questing philosophy include a duck brushed with local whisky and coconut syrup, which is smoked and served with house-made duck sausages, a salad made with Sungyod rice – a prized strain from Southern Thailand – and a duck jus-infused long pepper curry.\n“We want to be one of the doors for others to know about native and indigenous ingredients,” said Jantraget. “By blending tradition and innovation, I believe that Thai cuisine can be one of the best in the world.”\n\n\nSAAWAAN\nWhen it comes to food, sometimes the simplest of creations have the greatest impact.\nIn the case of Sujira “Aom” Pongmorn, the head chef at Saawaan – a small but perfectly formed venue in the Sathorn area of Bangkok – it was the humblest of Thai dishes, khai jiao (Thai-style omelette), that set her on the road to culinary heights.\n“My parents were very busy with their business when I was young and my father said that I would occasionally need to cook for myself,” she recalled. “He opened the fridge and pointed me to some eggs and told me to get to work. I don’t remember that first one being very good: I think I ended up burning it actually.”\nPongmorn has come a long way since that first abortive effort. At Saawaan, familiar Thai tropes such as beef salads, crab fat dips, grilled pork neck, and spicy-sour soups are reinvented as delicate tasting portions.\n""What I\'ve tried to do is deliver a contemporary take on Thai cooking traditions such as dips, charcoal grilling, soups, and curries. I\'ve tried to use these techniques and present them in a way that is beautifully presented – but still yummy.""\nSaawaan earned a Michelin star in 2018, the venue’s first year of operation. And with inspectors doing their rounds on a yearly basis, Pongmorn believes the pressure to keep standards high is bearing fruit.\n“It means that I need to keep improving,” she said. “These days, I’m always looking at ways to do better: Whether it’s researching different dishes and herbs from all over Thailand or finding local farmers to source great products from. Michelin has forced us all to up our game.”\nsaawaan.com\n\n\nSORN\nWhile a new generation of Thai chefs is applying a fresh approach to the cuisine, there’s no lack of respect for their forebears.\nA case in point is Sorn, where chef-owner Supaksorn Jongsiri – better known as Khun Ice – has honed skills passed down to him by his grandmother to take Southern Thai cuisine to a Michelin-star worthy level.\xa0\nFor years, Jongsiri was the driving force behind Baan Ice, a homely restaurant specialising in southern dishes where his elderly relative headed up the kitchen.\nHis latest venture – a collaboration with fellow chef Yodkwan U-pumpruk – ups the game significantly while retaining a healthy reverence for bold flavours and traditional techniques.\nAt Sorn, painstaking attention to detail is applied to the fiery notes of southern Thai cuisine. The chefs make frequent trips to Thailand’s southern provinces to source local herbs and ingredients and research new recipes.\nTheir scholarly approach imparts extra depth to the food at Sorn. Fish is lightly charcoal grilled before serving for added smokiness while soups are stewed for hours using specially selected beef bones.\nGiven all this effort, it’s little wonder that the restaurant has become one of the city\'s hottest dining tickets – with a months-long waiting list for the 20-seat venue, which is tucked away in an elegant wooden mansion in the city’s Phrom Phong neighbourhood.\nFRONT ROOM\n""I was just really, really bored,"" said Fae Chummongkhon, explaining her circuitous route from a disgruntled exiled housewife in Denmark to the pinnacle of Bangkok\'s dining scene.\nThe chef, originally from Chiang Rai in northern Thailand, has one of the most unconventional career paths of any chef in the country.\nAfter following her Danish businessman husband to his homeland, she filled the empty hours when he was at work by furthering her culinary education and serving time in some of Denmark’s top restaurants.\nNow her hard work is paying a dividend as Front Room, a thrillingly original venue at the plush Waldorf Astoria where she combines experience garnered during a 12-year stint at some of the top restaurants in Denmark with her roots in Thailand to create something she bills as Nordic/Thai.\nHer subtle shading of styles has made Front Room a scorching hot tip for a Michelin star. And it’s hard to see how inspectors might resist dishes like Raised in Korat, a tour de force featuring a cylindrical crisp made with cauliflower and squid ink and sprinkled with saffron and black garlic, filled with Thai beef striploin tartare and served with cold smoked egg yolk and apple sauce.\n“Chefs here are now stretching out a bit,” added Chummongkhon. “People nowadays are willing to pay more to be taken on an innovative dining journey.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     Bangkok ', '     Restaurants ', '     food ', '     Thailand ', '     Travel ', '     holiday ', '     Fine dining ']}"

  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: A S$768 million plant to produce methionine - an essential additive in animal feed - was officially opened in Singapore on Tuesday (Jun\xa018).\nThe new complex by German speciality chemicals manufacturer Evonik Industries is the company’s second in Singapore\xa0and was\xa0constructed next to its existing plant on Jurong Island,\xa0which has been in operation\xa0since 2014.\nEvonik’s new plant will help the company double its capacity in Asia – from 150,000 metric tonnes to about 300,000 metric tonnes, making up approximately 40 per cent of its 730,000 metric tonnes global output.\xa0\nAside from Singapore, Evonik has four similar plants in Belgium, Germany and the United States. The combined investment in both Singapore plants - more than S$1.5 billion - is the company\'s largest investment outside Germany to date.\nEvonik is hoping to grow its business in the region\xa0on the back of the increasing number of middle-class families in Asia.\xa0\n“On the one hand, the growing consumer affluence in Asia supports the increasing demand for animal protein. On the other,\xa0producers are increasingly focusing on more sustainable production of meat, eggs, milk, and fish,” said Mr Johann Caspar-Gammelin,\xa0chairman of the Board of Management of Evonik Nutrition and Care.\nSpeaking at the launch\xa0in Capitol Theatre on Tuesday, Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat highlighted that Asia\'s\xa0demand for meat and seafood\xa0is set to grow by 78 per cent by 2050. He also noted that climate change has\xa0posed a challenge to food security.\n""Global food security is becoming an increasingly pressing issue,"" Mr Heng added. ""We will require new and innovative ways to meet these needs sustainably.""\xa0\nProducts like methionine is one such example, he added.\nMethionine, when added to animal feed, can enable ""healthier, more sustainable and more resource-efficient protein production"".\nEvonik’s facility also presents an opportunity for good jobs and upskilling of workers in the energy and chemicals industry, Mr Heng noted.\n“Over the years, Evonik’s growth in Singapore has also created other new kinds of jobs beyond manufacturing jobs. For example, Evonik’s Asia Research Hub in Singapore hires scientists and researchers, who work on cutting-edge developments in 3D printing and other areas,"" the Deputy Prime Minister added.\nMore than\xa0100 new jobs are expected to be created at the new plant. They range from lab and process technicians, to engineers in the maintenance, environmental, safety and health domains.\nWith plans to improve the capabilities of companies through the Energy and\xa0Chemicals Industry Transformation Map (ITM), the sector is expected to create S$12.7 billion in value-add and 1,400 new jobs by 2025.\n', 'related_topics': ['     technology ', '     food ', '     Heng Swee Keat ']}"

      Inventor of guilt-free desserts is world's top pastry chef
  </h1>, 'text': 'PARIS:\xa0Her desserts are often not at all sweet and she couldn\'t give a fig if people complain that they don\'t look great on Instagram.\nBut that did not stop Jessica Prealpato being named the best pastry chef on the planet Tuesday (Jun 11) by the World\'s 50 Best Restaurants ranking.\nThe 32-year-old French woman, who is about to have her first child, is the creator of a whole new genre of guilt-free patisserie.\nFor Prealpato it is not about how a dessert looks, it\'s how it tastes -\xa0and the feelgood glow afterwards.\nThe subtle and sublime creations she turns out at the three-star Michelin restaurant of the Plaza Athenee hotel in Paris are a rebuff to the sugar-rush burn of food porn.\nYet even she has not dared to have her father - a patissier forged in full-on sugar worship of French tradition -\xa0taste her creations that match strawberries with pine shoots and lemon with seaweed.\n""He would not understand what I do at all,"" she told AFP.\nPrealpato has eschewed the sugar high to go for what her boss at the Plaza Athenee, the French superchef Alain Ducasse, calls ""naturalite"" - or naturalness -\xa0bringing out the full range of flavours that an ingredient already has.\nWhat Prealpato also does is use ingredients that would never normally make it onto a dessert trolley.\nSo you have malted beer sorbet with barley crumble and hop galettes, cherry olive vinaigrette or vanilla Jerusalem artichokes with truffles.\nSUGAR AS SEASONING\n""We shake people up,"" Prealpato laughed.\nShe has already produced a book of 50 of her desserts called ""Desseralite"", including her ""All Rhubarb"", where the often astringent plant is served roasted, raw, fermented, grilled and poached.\n""I love to use vinegars and try every style of cooking so that I get the most flavours out of a product,"" said Prealpato, one of a tiny number of female patisserie chefs working in three-star restaurants.\nSome of her peers have criticised her for the unfussy way she presents her food, claiming that it is not sophisticated enough for such an upscale establishment.\nAnd four years ago when she was starting out at Alain Ducasse at the Plaza Athenee she said that the famed chef left her in tears when he refused to taste one of her first fruit-based desserts.\n""I can see why now,"" she said.\n""I had presented it like a patisserie chef usually would, with lots of mousse, cream and a tuile.\n""For him, a dessert didn\'t have to be about these things.""\nSo Prealpato ""took everything away... today I rarely ever work with chocolate or coffee.""\nInstead her desserts play with sourness and acidity, and she uses sugar as others would salt -- for seasoning.\nPRETTY ISN\'T EVERYTHING\n""I understand why some clients may not like that,"" she said.\nInitially hurt by such negative feedback, Prealpato has become used to it.\nIt also makes being crowned the world\'s best pastry chef all the more sweet.\n""I am amazed. It\'s enormous for me. I never would have guessed that my patisseries would go that far.""\nWith a frankness rare at the top of her profession, Prealpato admitted that ""they aren\'t exactly beautiful to look at.\n""They may seem very simple but a huge amount of work goes into making them,"" she said.\nOn average it takes a month to create a new recipe and her dessert menu changes rapidly with the seasons.\nNor does the Earth generally shake when Prealpato puts them on Instagram -\xa0unlike her Parisian rival Cedric Grolet who won the title last year and has more than 1.3 million fans who eagerly share his visually stunning creations.\n""My poor 20,000 followers!"" Prealpato joked.\nUnlike Grolet - who like her is something of a sugar sceptic -\xa0she said she doesn\'t have the time to make her desserts look good by putting them on a white background.\nNor does she have anything against traditional French patisserie, which she loves -\xa0she just doesn\'t want to spend her life making them.\n""I came here (to work with Ducasse) because I was sick of doing chocolate pistachio and cherry almond all the time.\nSome of the classics ""are so good I don\'t see how you can revisit them,"" she said.\nNone of the members of her Franco-Italian family of cooks and patissiers have tasted her latest creations.\n""When I go home we don\'t talk about my work, and my parents don\'t really know what I am up to, which is fine by me.\n""We love to sit down together and eat food you can share -\xa0it\'s often not fancy at all.""\n', 'related_topics': ['     food ', '     France ']}"

      The Cebuano who quit his lucrative job to roast pigs in Singapore
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Christian Nacilla Calledo seemed to be living the dream in Singapore as a successful insurance agent. But the well-paid job made him unhappy, so he traded it for a career roasting suckling pigs.\n“Having money as the only incentive to do things just got old. I simply wanted to do more with my life, not just chase sale after sale,” said the Filipino. “I didn’t want to just die at my desk.”\nHe was neither a chef nor did he have any professional training or experience as a lechonero — someone who roasts whole pigs over charcoal. And running the show took a toll on him.\n“After a whole day of cooking, I’d just lie down on the carpet, and I’d cry because I was so tired,” he recalled. “I was very used to working in an office.”\nWatch: Becoming a master of Cebu\'s lechon (3:55)\nToday, the 38-year-old is at the forefront of Cebuano cuisine in Singapore, with his eatery Iskina Cebu serving its famous lechon, which some consider a national dish of the Philippines.\nNow with his food business a success in his homeland too, his story is told in the On The Red Dot series, Makan and Migrants. (Watch the episode here.)\nLAND OF MILK AND HONEY\nCalledo and his-then girlfriend left the Philippines in 2007 to seek new opportunities in Singapore, which he considers the Asian “American dream”.\n“We didn’t know anyone,” he said. “It was the Singapore dream, full of promise — the land of milk and honey.”\nTheir first home was a rented room — just two metres long and wide — in a Bugis shophouse. Money was tight, and before he got his employment pass, he was selling used mobile phones.\n“At lunchtime, I’d have just S$1 or S$2. I’d buy soya bean milk, and I’d sit near the river, and I’d construct my dreams there,” he recalled.\nThanks to his gift of the gab, he found another job: Convincing people to sign up for credit card subscriptions. He later started selling insurance, which he did very well at — at a cost to his health.\n“You have customers you need to call … After lunch, I’d call a bit and then go to Harry’s and drink. I was drunk almost every day,” he said.\nHe grew tired of the humdrum work. “At first, it was fun because it afforded me a life that was good. But over time, it became all about the money, and it became so stressful,” he added.\nHe wanted to return home, but AJ, his girlfriend turned wife, felt that there were more opportunities for them and a better future for their children in Singapore.\nSo about five years ago, the couple together with a business partner set up Iskina Cebu, which became their home from home.\n“We made a Cebu here … When working and living in a country that’s far from your country, the best way to go home is through food,” he said.\n“I guess Iskina has saved me in a way. I was stressed … and then the solution presented itself. It was my brain telling me — just stop and do something else.”\nFOOD THAT BINDS\nTo him, lechon is special because back at home, it is usually eaten on special days, such as after Sunday mass, on birthdays and during Christmas. During town fiestas, he recalled, lechoneros were exceptionally busy.\n“I’ve always found that to be very interesting: Having people do something very tasty and so nice. There’s so much hard work and teamwork behind it — the camaraderie, drinking and merry-making,” said Calledo.\n“When I was younger, after my father left us … we had trying times in terms of finances. I specifically remember that we’d save money, just so that we’d have a good Sunday and have lechon. It binds people.""\nHe sometimes helped out in the kitchen, but it was in Singapore where he invested time in, and experimented with, cooking.\nWhen he opened Iskina Cebu in a Paya Lebar industrial estate, his wife doubled as a cashier and a cook while he did most of the preparation, cooking and cleaning.\n“I was really afraid on the first day because, of course, you wouldn’t know how people would react,” he said. “It was a run-down place; it was really old. So we had to make do with what we had.”\nHe learned\xa0that in Singapore, one does not need to be surrounded with many staff in a kitchen. “I’ve always admired (the way) people cook noodles here because it’s very efficient with just an auntie or an uncle,” he added.\nAt first, his stall struggled because few people knew about it. But within a few months, it managed to make a profit, thanks partly to food critic K F Seetoh writing about it.\nCalledo said he kept his food as authentic as possible — using charcoal to roast the meat, and spices similar to the ones in Cebu — but also adapted the recipe for the local palate, using less salt and skipping the MSG.\nCooking lechon is “all about patience”, as it takes hours of preparation and roasting, and his first lechon was far from “beautiful”, he admitted.\n“Then I slowly learned … and spent time with lechoneros in Philippines,” he said. “I can proudly say that I’ve bled, I’ve got burnt, I’ve cried in the name of being a lechonero.\n“Most kids would want to be pilots and astronauts when they grow up. Maybe deep inside, I wanted to be a lechonero because this is fun. This is representing your culture in the most unique way.”\nAs word spread, the stall began to count Philippine Ambassador to Singapore Joseph Del Mar Yap among its regular customers.\n“Christian’s lechon is … famous among the local Filipinos here. All of us from Cebu obviously feel that this Cebuano-style lechon is the best Filipino lechon,” he said. “He’s the only lechonero that I’ve met in Singapore.”\nONWARDS AND HOMEWARDS\nIskina Cebu was later forced to move, as its premises were sold and the new owner wanted halal certification. It relocated to Timbre+ in Ayer Rajah Crescent, and its customers followed.\n“I take pride in hearing about people coming from Johor Bahru even,” said Calledo. “They really make an effort.”\nAbout a year ago, he came full circle by bringing his brand to Manila. It was a success.\n“I think he’s (one of) the first few foreigners who’d set up their foreign food business in Singapore and brought it back (home),” said Seetoh.\nThe decision to return to the Philippines was taken partly because Calledo had his third child and wanted more family support. He also thought that “Singapore just got stressful”.\n“That was the ultimate goal in the first place: Go to Singapore and just make enough and go home,” he said.\n“It’s just that whatever value you gain from moving back … gets overshadowed by what Singapore has to offer, like security. You just need to weigh the pros and cons.”\nHe now shuttles between the two countries. He also hopes to inspire others to see that if success can be achieved “by someone as average as me, it can be done by anyone else”.\n“I’m proud that a Filipino or a Cebuano … made Cebu in Singapore,” he said. “Now it’s (about) making Cebu in Manila and hopefully in the world. So I’m bringing bits of my home to anywhere I go.”\nWatch this episode here.

      Some supermarket chains, manufacturers to stop selling certain products with partially hydrogenated oils next year
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Food manufacturers Gardenia, Nestle and Sunshine Bakeries will ensure that products they make and sell in Singapore will be free of partially hydrogenated oils (PHOs) by June next year. Such items will include bread and instant noodles.\nSupermarkets NTUC FairPrice, Sheng Siong and Prime will do the same for their house brand products.\nThe Ministry of Health (MOH) announced on Thursday (Jun 6) that these manufacturers and supermarkets have pledged to be PHO-free for these products one year ahead of a nationwide ban on the substance, which will come into effect in June 2021. MOH announced the ban in March this year.\nThe six players account for 50 per cent of the market share across snacks, baked goods, prepared meals and fat spreads. These are food categories that commonly contain PHOs, MOH said.\nNestle and Sunshine Bakeries said more than 98 of their products in Singapore are already PHO-free, while Gardenia said its bread has been PHO-free since the early 2000s.\nAt a briefing held by MOH and the Health Promotion Board (HPB) on Thursday, MOH said the move is part of the Government’s ongoing efforts to create a healthier environment for the public.\nPHOs, which are formed during partial hydrogenation - an industrial process which converts liquid oil to semi-solid fats to increase the shelf-life of products - are a form of artificial trans fats and are the key source of such fat in people’s diets, MOH said.\nIt is estimated that about 10 per cent of snacks, baked goods, prepared meals and fat spreads in Singapore currently contain PHOs.\nMost of these foods are imported, HPB said.\n“Trans fat consumption is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. There is no safe level of consumption of trans fat,” an MOH spokesperson said.\nSingapore’s approach to artificial trans fat is aligned with the World Health Organisation’s recommendation as well as international practices, the health authority added.\nOther countries, including the United States and Thailand, have already banned PHOs.\nThe ban will replace Singapore\'s current 2 per cent trans fat limit in fats and oils sold here, which has helped to halve the average daily trans fat intake among Singaporeans from 2.1g in 2010 to 1g in 2018, MOH said.\nHPB said that despite the reduction, the average daily intake among some people, such as young adults aged between 18 and 39, is double the national average.\nThis is mainly due to their higher consumption of pre-packaged foods containing trans fat, a spokesperson added.\nThe industry will be provided with guidelines to facilitate a smooth transition, and to ensure compliance with the ban, MOH said, adding that Enterprise Singapore will also support food companies with an “enterprise development grant” for changing product formulas.\nAlternative ingredients manufacturers can use include canola and sunflower oils.\nThose who do not comply with the ban when it comes into effect will be asked to withdraw their products.\nWhen asked about the need for a two-year buffer, despite some companies being able to be ready one year earlier, HPB said this is to be fair and to give smaller retailers who may order products with PHOs in smaller quantities more time to comply with the ban.\nStill, as consumers start to identify “partially hydrogenated” in ingredient lists, they may start voting with their wallets, which would be a powerful incentive for companies to change more quickly, HPB said.\n“MOH welcomes more manufacturers, importers, and retailers to commit to the pledge,” a spokesperson said.\nSenior Parliamentary Secretary for Health Amrin Amin, who was on a site visit at a Sheng Siong supermarket outlet in Bukit Panjang, said that the ban comes at a time when there are enough substitutes for PHOs.\nHe reassured consumers that prices will not be affected.\n""Based on our studies, we know there are enough alternatives, so we do not expect price increases. We have received feedback and assurance from retailers as well,"" he said.\n', 'related_topics': ['     food ', '     health ']}"

      From finance undergrad to food waste warrior, with a made-in-Singapore invention
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: As a finance student at the Singapore University of Social Sciences, there was a time when Rayner Loi dreamed of a career in investment or private banking. But that changed with one fateful conversation about three years ago.\nThe then 22-year-old was working on a service learning project that involved befriending at-risk youth. He had taken a boy out for dinner and, while dropping him off at his doorstep, mentioned to the mother that there was no need to prepare dinner for her son.\n“She just broke down and started thanking me profusely,” Loi recounted. “I was like, Auntie, it’s one dinner. I can afford it.\n“But then she said that on most days, she can’t afford to put dinner on the table for herself and her son.”\nIt was this, said Loi, that broke his heart — and moved him to invent a solution to food waste.\n“As an ignorant 22-year-old, I didn’t realise that there were such families struggling so badly to the point where even having dinner was a challenge,” he added.\n“What made matters worse was that I was also reading about Singapore’s food waste situation, and I couldn’t reconcile (myself to) the fact that we could be throwing away so much good food as a country, when there are families like that struggling with food insecurity.”\nToday, Loi is on a leave of absence from school to work on his new project: A smart food waste tracker that uses artificial intelligence to measure and identify all the food waste that goes into dustbins.\nPOWERFUL INFORMATION\nThrough his start-up, Good For Food, he works with businesses such as hotels and dining halls to install his tracker, known as Insight, on top of their existing dustbins.\nWhen food is thrown into a bin, the tracker uses a built-in camera, sensors and image recognition technology to log the food waste generated.\nThe data collected is automatically sent to the cloud, which Good For Food uses to generate reports — actionable insights as Loi describes them — for clients to act on to reduce their food waste.\n“If we can tell a buffet restaurant that for the last 30 days, they’ve thrown away … maybe 10 kilogrammes of curry chicken, on average, for every lunch service, they can then use that information to better plan for future lunch services,” he explained.\n“Perhaps they could reduce the amount of curry chicken they put on their buffet line by 5 kg first, and then continue to monitor and see if there can be further optimisations.”\nThere are now 12 trackers installed, spread across hotels, central kitchens and catering kitchens. But Loi said he looked to hotels as his first market, as they face a unique challenge when it comes to preparing their buffet food.\nAs they must ensure that the lines are well stocked with food, they tend to err on the side of caution and prepare more than enough, resulting in leftovers.\n“The worst thing for (hotels) is to have guests complain that they paid S$80 or S$90 for a buffet and the food has run out, so what the hoteliers normally do is to overproduce,” he said.\n“The hoteliers and kitchens know they’re throwing away a lot of food, but they don’t really know how to go about dealing with it.”\nLoi said he has seen clients’ food waste fall, on average, by 30 to 40 per cent with the help of the Insight tracker, and their food costs go down by about 3 to 8 per cent.\nAndaz Singapore, for example, began trials on the Insight tracker last month, and while the hotel’s general manager Olivier Lenoir said it is early days, he expects a food waste reduction of at least 20 per cent.\nPrior to that, said Lenoir, the hotel had been manually weighing its food waste and recording the amounts generated. But the waste had not been classified into different categories, such as smoked salmon or orange peels.\n“It doesn’t tell us whether we’re throwing away things that are still good to eat or could’ve been kept in a better way,” he said. “The Good For Food system is super simple, and there are no extra steps required.”\nThe information generated can be powerful: Knowing the exact amounts and specification of what the hotel throws away can go a long way towards reducing its waste, even by making small changes such as reducing the size of its buffet plates.\n“Instead of putting all our smoked salmon out on the buffet line on a large platter, we could have three smaller plates, and put just one out at a time,” said Lenoir.\n“You’d rather have a small plate that’s full than a big platter that’s half full.”\nA LONG THREE YEARS\nToday, Good For Food is going from strength to strength, with international hotel brands among its clients, and growing interest from markets such as Jakarta and Macau.\nThe company, which Loi co-founded in 2017 with his current chief technology officer Keshav Sivakumar, also receives funding from the Temasek Foundations family.\n“We’re heartened to see young people like Rayner producing an innovative solution to deal with a food waste problem,” said Temasek Foundation Ecosperity chief executive Lim Hock Chuan.\n“We hope more young people will join the ranks of innovators and find solutions to make Singapore a more sustainable and liveable place.”\nIt may have been just three years since Loi’s life changed, but it was a long journey from finance undergraduate to CEO of his own technology start-up: A journey filled with learning experiences, setbacks and no small measure of hard work.\nHis first idea was a mobile app he started in late 2016 that allowed restaurants with surplus food to sell it to needy customers at a heavy discount.\nIt was easy to find customers, but he struggled to get restaurants on board, largely because he had been targeting mainly fast-casual restaurants.\n“A lot of them are à la carte and cook to order … so under those circumstances, they don’t really have a lot of waste to begin with, which I was pleasantly surprised by,” he said.\n“But sad to say, I think they also found that having such a platform was going to be a hassle.”\nThere were other people, he added, who had the same idea. His co-founder Keshav was one of them. The two met by chance the following year, on an incubator programme for budding entrepreneurs.\nWATCH: How they did it (3:53)\nWhen he realised they shared the same passion for solving the food waste problem, he seized the opportunity to get Keshav, then 18, to join him. “He’s an amazing engineer, and I think we complement each other quite well,” said Loi.\n“I’m super thankful to him because every business needs a CTO and a CEO … No tech start-up can flourish and grow without both, so it was a blessing from heaven that I could find him in that programme.”\nLoi was then juggling his schoolwork with his responsibilities in the start-up. But when the company received its first round of funding in the middle of 2017, he knew it was time to hit the pause button on school.\nIt was also around that time, he said, that he no longer dreamed of going into private or investment banking. “Previously, I was so excited about modules on portfolio management and finance,” he said.\n“But slowly, those things became boring to me. And all I could think about was how I was going to help hoteliers manage their food waste and how I was going to build Good For Food.”\n'LEGACY OVER CURRENCY'\nWith hopes of regional expansion, it is exciting times for Good For Food. But as Loi said, there are challenges aplenty and also times when the work can get monotonous.\nFor one thing, a lot of time is spent building the image recognition system in the tracker by training the AI to understand the different types of waste generated in any kitchen.\nThis process, said Loi, is similar to training a toddler to distinguish between a cat and a dog — by generating images of food waste to help the AI tell the difference between, say, roast beef and chicken.\n“We have tens of thousands of images in our data bank,” he said. “So you can imagine how many man hours we’re investing in this.”\nEvery food item thrown away by a restaurant must be manually tagged by a human and verified by another.\nAnd there Loi was, with lead product engineer Adriel Tan, hunched over their keyboards in the Good For Food office, fingers flying as they tagged image after image, oblivious to the flurry of activity around them.\nHis record? Tagging 700 images in one sitting. “That was all I did the entire day. Adriel was sitting there looking at me … and I was like, I’m not going home until I finish it,” he said, grinning.\n“There are 82 images today — I think it’s a good day.”\nFor now, the monotony of such work is par for the course. As his machine toddler grows up and recognises more images, he hopes that these tasks will take less time in future.\nBut like a proud parent, Loi said there is not a moment when he is not thinking about his work. While he tries to shut it out on Sundays, he admits it is a challenge.\n“As a parent, do you ever not think about your child? You want the best for it, you want to nurture it … have full control over it,” he said. “It’s the same for a start-up.”\nHe stopped suddenly. “Wah, I sound like a controlling parent,” he added, laughing.\nJust as he once dreamed of a high-flying financial career for himself, today he has big dreams for his baby. Beyond going regional, Loi believes there is great potential for working with airlines or cruise ships.\nBut over the years, he has also realised that his dreams and passion encompass far more than dollars and cents. “Today, what drives me is legacy over currency,” he said.\n“What do I want to be known for in 10, 20 years’ time? It’s not so much about me being able to draw a five-figure salary, or Good For Food becoming a billion-dollar unicorn.\n“I want to be remembered as someone who took action to tackle global problems and who brought about a serious reduction in carbon emissions by tackling food waste.”\n"", 'related_topics': ['     technology ', '     food ', '     CNA Insider ']}"

      The farm boy who became owner of one of Singapore's largest mala xiang guo chains
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: When this farmer’s son from Chongqing borrowed money to open a stall selling mala xiang guo in Singapore in 2015, he was taking a gamble in the food and beverage scene here.\nBack then, Singaporeans were largely unfamiliar with this stir-fried version of the mala hotpot — 90 per cent of his customers were Chinese nationals.\nPretty soon, Yang Jian, the owner of You Ma You La, found himself in trouble because of weak footfall. To avoid closing his stall, he resorted to secretly pawning his wedding ring, his wife’s earrings and his child’s bracelet.\nAnd then he had a brainwave: Mini lobsters.\n“It was a very difficult six months until mala mini lobster came to mind,” he said. “Mala mini lobster was a very popular dish in China, but it was very rare in Singapore.”\nHe created a WeChat group to advertise the dish, arrange group buys and pre-orders and even post video clips of the live mini lobster and the cooking process to whet customers’ appetites.\nThanks to his quick thinking, he managed to turn his fledgling business around.\nOver the next two years, mala xiang guo caught fire and became a food craze in Singapore — and Yang was in the vanguard of migrant hawkerpreneurs here who fanned that flame.\nWATCH: From farmboy to Mala king (4:05)\nNow with 14 outlets to his chain, his story is told in the On The Red Dot series, Makan and Migrants. (Watch the episode here.)\nDREAMS OF A BIGGER LIFE\nBorn poor, Yang grew up on a farm where, he admitted, “we didn’t dress well, we didn’t eat well and we’d never been to a big city”.\nWhen he finally experienced city life after serving in the military, he was blown away by the lifestyles of the rich, with their big houses and posh cars.\n“I told myself to work hard because I thought these people must’ve been able to afford these cars only after working hard and earning money,” recalled the 40-year-old.\nTrained as a chef in 2003 — “I topped my class,” he said proudly — he soon got a job in Jiangsu as a head chef. After a year, he took over the restaurant when his boss quit.\nIn just three years, he earned enough to buy a house. But in 2008, because of the financial crisis, he sold the restaurant to venture out of China.\n“I chose Singapore because I’d heard that there were more Chinese (people) around,” he said.\n“During that time, Sichuan food wasn’t very popular in Singapore. There were only a few stores but I felt that there was the potential for the growth of Sichuan food such as mala.”\nHe started off working in a Chinatown restaurant and then in Geylang selling the popular mala duck necks.\n“When I received my long-term visit pass, the first thing I wanted to do was to open a mala xiang guo stall in a food court because the risks were lower and the investment capital was lower too,” he said.\nUNDETERMINED ORIGINS\nMala, which is from the Chongqing and Sichuan region, is usually associated with hotpot, while mala xiang guo is stir-fried with mala spices and ingredients such as seafood, vegetables and soya products.\nHowever, the origins of mala xiang guo are still undetermined, with Yang pointing out that its name did not exist until recent times.\nHis own theory is that the dish was conjured up by a Chongqing chef who had gone to Beijing and, while preparing lunch for work, fried different ingredients with chillies and peppercorns.\n“He realised it tasted pretty good. After several recipes and taste tests, he developed and came up with this name,” he said.\nIn Singapore, the mala hotpot craze came some years before the mala xiang guo revolution.\nThe fascination with mala (“ma” for tongue-numbing and “la” for spicy) has spun off creations ranging from cup noodles to potato chips to burgers, said food blogger Daniel Ang of DanielFoodDiary. It also became a trending item on social media.\n“You get mala traces everywhere, and that got people interested in mala as a whole,” he added.\n“People who’d never experienced mala would think this tastes good. (They) might just want to go back to its origins, to have a mala hotpot or a mala xiang guo.”\nJulius Lim, who writes food reviews for digital food guide Burpple, agreed that as mala hotpot grew in popularity, Singaporean eating culture evolved an attraction for the stir-fried version.\n“That’s how it caught fire, and it created the tipping point for more and more mala stalls to open,” he said.\n“And mala xiang guo, I think, is one of the lead (products) because many years ago, I didn’t see many people queueing (for it).”\nA FUTURE NATIONAL DISH?\nBut when Yang was starting out — with a S$10,000 investment, part of which he borrowed from friends — business was not plain sailing.\n“In the first four months, we were losing money. We didn’t take a salary,” he recounted. “We couldn’t even pay the rent.”\nThe jewellery he pawned to cope with the losses gave him S$5,000.\n“I didn’t know about him pawning the bangle until there was one day, close to Chinese New Year, my mum wanted to put it on my child,” said his wife Chen Liyun.\n“He was smart not to worry me. But knowing that my husband had lied to me, I was bound to be angry.”\nBut he maintained that he had little choice, as the alternative was to close the business.\nThe mini-lobster idea that then saved the day, and gave him first-mover advantage, was “very smart” of him, said Lim. And his business has since expanded across the island.\nToday, Singaporeans make up close to half his clientele, unlike when he first started. “I never imagined that Singaporeans — Chinese and Indians — would actually enjoy mala xiang guo,” said Yang, now a permanent resident here.\nBy opening stalls in the heartlands, he has provided locals with easy access to mala xiang guo, pointed out Ang.\n“This food not only works where the Chinese immigrants or community is, it also works well in the heartlands,” added the food blogger.\nChen, who quit her job as a kindergarten teacher to help her husband, sees mala xiang guo as their gift to Singapore from China, while Yang has even bigger hopes for it.\nHe wishes to “follow in the footsteps of the early Chinese migrants” and their “famous” chicken rice.\n“They made Hainanese chicken rice a national dish. I, too, want to bring the flavours of Chongqing to Singapore and make it a national dish. I’d like to make Chongqing’s mala famous,” he said.\nWatch this episode here.

      In downtown Seoul, humble temple food given a makeover and a Michelin star
  </h1>, 'text': 'Simple, humble and mildly flavoured – that is what people typically think of temple fare, given its vegan nature and lack of strong aromatics like garlic, onions, chives and leeks. While it serves its purpose of nourishing monks and nuns in accordance to their way of life, it’s certainly not the type of food that would usually capture the interest of the general public, let alone the Michelin Guide.\nNot until Balwoo Gongyang opened its doors in Seoul, that is. Run by the Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism to promote the food culture of the religion, this restaurant has been serving delicate temple cuisine since 2009. In 2016, it was awarded one star by the very first Seoul edition of the Michelin food guide, which officially put Korean temple food under the city’s culinary spotlight.\nKim Ji Young, the chef behind the simple yet exquisite food of the restaurant, recognises the significance of the award but also knows that temple cuisine goes much deeper: “People started to learn more about temple cuisine after we got the Michelin accreditation and that’s a good thing… but, personally, I think that Balwoo Gongyang doesn’t necessarily need a Michelin star – it’s more about how good the taste of baru gongyang dishes is.”\n“When people come to Korea and want to try temple cuisine, they don’t know where to start. This is a place where they can experience that, as well as an understanding [of] Buddhism,” said Kim.\nThe allure of Korean temple food, besides the beauty of its simplicity, comes in part from its rarity outside of temple walls. While it is not impossible to find places that serve temple food, none of them are quite like Balwoo Gongyang, which only uses original, traditional recipes that are passed down in Korean temples.\nThe term baru gongyang refers to the monastic way in which nuns and monks in temples eat. “Baru is the bowl they eat from. Baru gongyang means you take all the food including rice, soup, side dishes and even water in that bowl and finish it. This way, it’s not just eating but also training the mind… refraining from being greedy,” explained Kim.\nKim started her culinary career in Korean royal court cuisine; it was her quest for natural food that later led her to temple cuisine. “People have the misconception that temple food must be simple and bland. I would like people to know that it can also be\xa0special,” said Kim.\nFew cuisines are as focused on the seasonality of ingredients as temple food is – vegetables are used only at the peak of their flavour, which explains why menus are planned around what’s available. Another key principle of cooking temple food is to add as little as possible to a dish – when seasonings are used minimally, the original flavour of fresh ingredients can then be appreciated fully.\nKim was trained by a leading master of temple food – Venerable Seonjae of the Jogye Order, who taught her infinitely more than just culinary techniques. “Venerable Seonjae told me once that those who cook need to be mindful of the people who eat their food. I completely agree,” said Kim.\nAdapted from the series Remarkable Living.

      What it takes to be Asia’s Best Restaurant: Inside the workings of Odette
  </h1>, 'text': 'The night Odette was named Asia’s Best Restaurant 2019, chef Julien Royer and general manager Steven Mason did what most winners do – they celebrated with more than a few drinks. “But it was nothing too wild,” Royer was quick to point out. “We had to catch the ferry (out of Macau) early the next morning. We arrived in Singapore at 10pm and went back to the restaurant to drink champagne with the team.”\nAs historic as the win is – Odette is the first restaurant from Singapore to earn the crown – an award in the restaurant business is just that: A rewarding affirmation from a punishing industry for the hard work and long hours that everyone puts in. By 9am the next day, it was business as usual.\n\n\nA post shared by Odette (@odetterestaurant)\nIt’s a hustle the team knows well. Long before it was Asia’s Best Restaurant, Odette has had the honour of being Singapore’s busiest fine dining establishment. Since it opened its doors almost four years ago, it hasn’t gone a day without a warm seat in the house.\n“With rankings and awards, you must accept that you will win and you will lose. I know that all that is ephemeral,” Royer said when asked about the attendant pressure that comes with the prestigious prize. “What matters is that we must be doing something right because the restaurant has been fully booked since day one. That is the most priceless to us. That is what we constantly work for.”\nINSIDE THE KITCHEN\nRoyer may be Odette’s main man, but like all good leaders, he is backed by a devoted team of about 25 full-time employees. A meal service here is akin to a world-class dance performance that exudes effortless grace and rhythm, from the warm smiles that greet guests as they enter, right down to the spotless gleam of a paper-thin water glass that has been polished thrice.\nBehind their balletic fluidity is the ever-unfurling toil of physical labour, precision cooking and precious camaraderie. The team works in collective harmony, each member dependant on the other for the restaurant’s success. They do this 16 hours a day, five days a week.\nRoyer describes his kitchen’s balance as “fragile” and leans upon his senior sous chefs Adam Wan and Levin Lau, and sous chef Sheng Xiong to ensure that the equilibrium never wavers.\n“I make all my decisions about hiring in the kitchen with them,” said Royer. “If one of us has doubts about the person, I don’t hire him or her. This fragile balance is key to our success because everyone here must want to shine as a team, not as an individual. As soon as someone is unhappy, you can tell.” Even at this level of cooking, the adage that a happy cook produces better food remains sound.\nThe work they do is repetitive and exacting. The complex dishes change daily, depending largely on the produce and the team’s imagination. Royer prefers to buy ingredients in small quantities, which keeps the team creative and prevents waste. One of the perks of being a restaurant renowned for its delicious ingenuity is that every day, distributors from all over the world stream in with produce they hope the kitchen will buy. Today, it was wild asparagus from Italy; yesterday, it was jars of honey from the Philippines.\nThe team literally hits the ground running from the minute they arrive at their stations at 8.30am. For Royer, who typically arrives a little later at 9am, the first order of business is greeting and chatting with every member of his restaurant. “It’s very important to have a close relationship with everyone here,” he reiterated.\n“What matters is that we must be doing something right because the restaurant has been fully booked since day one. That is the most priceless to us. That is what we constantly work for.” – Julien Royer\nLunch is the first priority and a complicated exercise since guests are given the option of a four, six or eight-course menu with a choice of dishes for various courses. There’s also a vegetarian menu and the fact that things don’t always go to plan.\n“A lot of what we cook depends on the timing of the deliveries,” Royer added. “For example, today, I wanted to make a scallop with konbu and nage with mint, but the scallops came late, so we are using crabmeat instead. We also wanted to do morels with asparagus and sweetbread, but now the morels are coming tomorrow. Every day we have to deal with this balance, but I love it. I think this is the way to do it. When you don’t order a lot of ingredients, you don’t end up wasting and there is no spoilage.”\n\n\nOn an easy afternoon, the last guests leave the dining room at 3.30pm. Often, however, diners tend to stay far longer. The day before this interview, the last lunch guest left at 5.30pm.\nFRONT AND CENTRE\nThe hierarchy in the dining room, called the front-of-house in industry parlance, mirrors that of the kitchen. At the top is general manager Steven Mason, who is aided by his team of about 14 assistant managers, head waiters, sommeliers, hostesses and waiters. The service they each purvey is built around providing a personalised experience and the ability to read a guest.\n“We teach people that when they go to a table, they must see what the table wants. If I start explaining the dish and they’re not interested or focused, then I back off and leave them to their food. If we see them examining the bottom of a plate or glass, we tell them where the glass is from or who made the plate,” explained Mason.\n“If one of us has doubts about [a] person, I don’t hire him or her. This fragile balance is key to our success because everyone here must want to shine as a team, not as an individual.” – Julien Royer\nMuch of the front-of-house work comprises general labour. From the minute the first shift begins at 10am, the team mops floors, cleans tables and windows, prepares the cheese and drinks trolleys, polishes plates and glasses, and adjusts lights to ensure they are angled just so. Two hostesses tend to the over 200 emails that the restaurant receives every day.\nAfter the last lunch guest leaves, the team takes about hour and a half to set up for dinner before they take their only break of the day. During this 40-minute window, the entire staff shares a meal together. “Three times a week we cook and three times a week, on big delivery days, we buy food like chicken rice or noodles,” said Royer.\n\n\nA post shared by Julien Royer (@chef_julien)\n“We spend so much time together and that makes us family,” added Mason. “We always try to create unity with people. Like family, we may have a fight today, but tomorrow we’re back at it.\n“This is not an environment that’s easy to work in – we are always busy and you only get 30 to 40 minutes to get something to eat and then go back to making sure people are happy and smiling and comfortable. So we value our people. This is what hospitality is about, not just for the guest, but for our staff too.”\nTHE HEART OF THE PEOPLE\nLike in any business, people form the cornerstone of Odette’s success. Not only must its managers ensure that employees remain happy and motivated, there are also hundreds of customers whose myriad preferences must be considered. The profiles of 450 regular diners are recorded in nuanced detail, be it special diets, allergies, water, seating or any other idiosyncratic preferences.\n“The hardest and most important thing is that everyone who comes to the restaurant has a different expectation, and we have to ensure we adhere to what they want,” said Mason. “With Julien, you’re always working in a style that’s changing and it can be a challenge to keep my team smiling and positive. So I make it a point to learn about them, have fun and laugh. We talk about how we can make things better rather than me telling them how things can be made better.”\n“We spend so much time together and that makes us family. Like family, we may have a fight today, but tomorrow we’re back at it.” – Steven Mason\nIt is obvious that Mason brings the pragmatism to Royer’s passion. “Julien always wants things immediately and I often have to tell him to slow down,” Mason said, giving Royer a jocular side eye. “Like we were just talking about how we can change the bill and Julien is like, ‘change it tonight!’ But I have to understand what’s the best way to do it and what the process is going to be.”\nHow does Royer think it’s going to get changed, I ask? “He doesn’t know!” replied Mason, and they both break out in laughter.\nIt is clear both men share a tight bond – they speak in the kind of shorthand that good friends share, shoot each other knowing looks throughout the conversation, and even finish each other’s sentences. They do, after all, spend more time together than they do with their wives.\nTheir shared commitment to the restaurant’s success shows in the accolades, the constantly busy dining room, and high rate of staff retention. The average rank and file employee stays with Odette for between 18 months to two years, while some like senior sous chef Levin Lau have worked with Royer for the last decade. This is impressive, as employee retention is something restaurants often grapple with, especially with the kind of hours that Odette demands.\n\n\nA post shared by Julien Royer (@chef_julien)\nAsia’s Best Restaurant or not, the pressure that comes with being at the top of the industry remains because they intrinsically originate from within. “We never allow it to get easy for ourselves. The idea is always to go forward,” said Mason. “We are, first and foremost, a business. What’s more important than any award is having a full, profitable restaurant night after night.”\nRoyer nods in agreement. “I think we can always do better than the day before.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     food ', '     Singapore ', '     restaurant ', '     Fine dining ']}"

      Spa Esprit's Cynthia Chua is opening her first Japanese restaurant in Singapore
  </h1>, 'text': 'Twelve years after her first foray into the F&B scene, Cynthia Chua is opening her first Japanese restaurant in Singapore next month (Jun 2019). And based on the success of\xa0concepts like Common Man Coffee Roasters, Forty Hands, Tiong Bahru Bakery and Tippling Club, there’s a high chance it’s going to be awesome.\nIn partnership with grow-your-own-food movement Edible Garden City, Chua is taking her farm-to-table concept first established with Open Farm Community (OFC) in Dempsey four years ago to the skies – to the rooftop of the revamped Funan mall.\nCalled Noka, the 75-seater, glass-walled sister restaurant to OFC will sit alongside a 5,000-sq-ft\xa0urban garden growing red chillies and mushrooms in a sheltered chamber, and many more species of vegetables, flowers and herbs, tended by their own farmers.\n“I think the urban farm is a very interesting concept; to have a farm in the city that celebrates regional produce,” Chua told CNA Luxury. “People are becoming more conscious about what they eat. They now want very honest food where the focus on the produce is really, really important; to do less with it but let the produce shine,” she added.\nNoka, which translates to ‘farmhouse’ in Japanese, will focus on extending the OFC concept to Japanese cuisine. “People love Japanese cuisine so we wanted to offer something familiar but interpreted in a way that opens up a world of discovery… Like using the culinary expertise of a Japanese chef to interpret local [ingredients] like kang kong,” she explained.\nFor Chua, rolling out new concepts is always a matter of divine timing: When the right talent and location present themselves.\n“There are many concepts in my head and sometimes it will take five years to develop. I didn’t meet a talented Japanese chef till now, and when the dots connect then I go, ‘Okay,\xa0I’m ready’,” said the relentless innovator.\n“People are becoming more conscious about what they eat. They now want very honest food where the focus on the produce is really, really important; to do less with it but let the produce shine.” – Cynthia Chua\nCHANGING SINGAPORE’S CULTURAL LANDSCAPE\nBold risk-taking and a fetish for tackling socially taboo subjects have been powering Cynthia Chua’s coterie of cool concepts since she started the Spa Esprit Group over two decades ago. It could even be said that the girl with the Midas touch for turning the mundane into empowering lifestyle movements has also changed Singapore’s cultural landscape for good.\nSince introducing Singaporean women to Brazilian waxes in 2002, Chua has built a lifestyle empire of beauty brands (STRIP, Browhaus) and trendy F&B establishments (BoCHINche, Ding Dong, The Butcher\'s Wife, alongside the aforementioned outlets) that number over 100 outlets around the world including London, New York and Shanghai.\nHer inventiveness was evident right from the start, cleverly distinguishing her brands with brilliant marketing campaigns. STRIP’s tongue-in-cheek advertisements featuring a hirsute orang utan, for instance, were injected with Chua’s risque brand of humour, helping to remove the embarrassment women may feel about personal grooming\xa0– and making it chic instead.\n“We said we were cleaning up the city, one bush at a time,” she laughed in recollection. “Now, we’re the global authority of hair removal,” she announced.\nHaving done such a good job “cleaning up the city”, the 47-year-old is moving on to educating the world on feminine\xa0care.\nEnter her newest obsession: Two Lips.\nTAKING CARE ‘DOWN THERE’\nTouted as the world\'s first activated charcoal mask to soothe, detox, brighten, moisturise and deodorise the vulva, the Blackout Mask launched last year is the first product in a new range of upmarket intimate care products she plans to develop under the Two Lips brand.\n\n\nA post shared by TWO L(I)PS (@twolips.vip)\nThe mask, made with bincho-tan\xa0charcoal from Japan, is formulated with ingredients such as white liquorice, elderberry, chamomile, ylang-ylang and aloe vera, and also boosts lymphatic drainage.\n“Your intimate area is where the biggest lymph nodes are, and they are generally stagnant unless you activate it. That’s why you get dark pigments around this area,” she explained.\nThe idea for Two Lips emerged from behind-the-curtain conversations customers had with their therapists at STRIP.\n\n\nA post shared by TWO L(I)PS (@twolips.vip)\n“They’ve got so many problems, like ingrown hair, and there aren’t any products that can help them,” she pointed out.\n“Plus, when girls have these problems, they’re too shy to talk about it, as we’re brought up in a culture that doesn’t talk about these things. So, it’s very synergistic for us to be in that space and we like going into spaces where we’re the first mover,” she said.\nThis ""female empowerment"", she said,\xa0comes in taking the time out to care for an often-neglected part of the anatomy: “It feels very good when you look after yourself. We should love ourselves and embrace our bodies.”\nAs the first two batches of 20,000 pieces of the Blackout Mask flew off the shelves, Chua realised just how great demand was for such upmarket intimate care products. She is now expanding the range to 16 organic, gynae-tested, non-scented, pH-balanced products. Expect around 10 new products by the end of 2019, and the remaining six by mid-2020, all of which will be available online\xa0and at STRIP outlets in Singapore.\n“It feels very good when you look after yourself. We should love ourselves and embrace our bodies.” – Cynthia Chua\nTHE NATURAL WINE MOVEMENT\nThese days, the self-professed “free spirit” spends a good portion of her time in Paris (with her French boyfriend), New York (her business partner and best friend lives there), and London (where her brands do brisk business) to nourish her creativity and inspire new ideas.\nIt was in New York that she trend-spotted the movement towards natural wines.\nNatural wines are made with minimal chemical and technological intervention, both in the way grapes are grown as well as in the wine-making process.\n“Natural wine is very big right now, especially in New York. I definitely see an uptrend; all the nice restaurants I’m always discovering in all the cool cities of the world have all switched to natural wine,” she observed.\nSo she created yet another concept – Drunken Farmer – as a pop-up bar that will travel to a new location in the group’s portfolio every six months, beginning with Tiong Bahru Bakery Safari at Dempsey.\nThe inaugural Drunken Farmer festival (its name inspired by the Jackie Chan film, Drunken Master) kicked off with a three-day showcase of 19 winemakers from Vivent Les Vins Libre, a collective of natural winemakers that have taken their Paris-born festival to New York, Amsterdam, Montreal, Hong Kong and, now, Singapore.\n\n\nA post shared by Drunken Farmer (@drunkenfarmer_sg)\nPUTTING A POSITIVE SPIN ON THINGS \nThe Cynthia Chua of today is a different person from the young woman who opened her first massage outlet in Holland Village 23 years ago with a S$200,000 investment she amassed from her stint as a property agent.\nThe accomplished businesswoman is perhaps less anal-retentive and no longer sweats the small stuff, believing instead in empowering her staff. But she is also no less driven than when she first began.\nA soulful regime of self-care rituals keeps her balanced yet focused: Yoga, meditation, essential oils, two massages a week, and journalling – she’s currently at Journal #57.\n\n\nA post shared by Spa Esprit (@spaesprit)\n“I’m a bit [of a] hippie,” she happily admitted, “and I always believe in the power of the mind.”\nChua’s positive spirit is infectious and, while her natural-born curiosity and abundant passion have blessed her with much success, it is not without some disappointments.\nShe has had to shutter several F&B concepts, like Skinny Pizza. “The mall model wasn’t right for the concept,” she said in hindsight, taking failure in her stride.\n“It’s been a learning curve. Life is always transformative; even if something doesn’t work, you learn from it. The most important thing is to keep evolving. Stagnation is very scary for entrepreneurs.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     Singapore ', '     restaurant ', '     food ']}"

      How Singapore’s restaurateurs are rising to the challenges of sustainability
  </h1>, 'text': 'Rising food costs, climbing rents and insufficient manpower are famously constant challenges in Singapore’s restaurant industry. Now add to that sustainability. As environmental consciousness and social responsibility become among the most talked-about topics in the world, restaurants have become the most accessible venues for customers to demand transparency and ethical practices.\nThink about it: As a country whose national pastime is dining out, who among us doesn’t want our meals to come from a place that is kind and nurturing to the environment, supports sustainable practices and creates little or zero waste?\n\n\nToday, there are numerous nuances to sustainability that a restaurant must consider, the biggest of which is waste. “The reality is that our overall industry in Singapore runs at 1.6 per cent profitability, which means something is wrong. How much are we wasting every day?” asked Chris Millar, Culinary Director of the 1-Group, which is behind restaurants like Summerhouse, 1-Altitude and Botanico.\n“Sometimes, the higher the turnover, the higher the wastage, which can result in higher losses. So, sustainability must go deeper and beyond just saying we buy fish from a local fish farm,” Millar added.\xa0 \xa0\n\n\nA post shared by The Summerhouse (@thesummerhousesg)\nGood restaurants have long made it a point to use all parts of the produce it buys. Parlaying lobster shells into bisque and vegetable trimmings into broths have always been par for the course; it just wasn’t something the industry crowed about.\nBut with the public eye on sustainability comes the demand for visibility of this commitment to waste reduction. To that end, restaurants like Salted & Hung have introduced menus that revolve around the creative use of even the scrappiest ingredients. Fish bones, for example, are infused with soy to yield an aromatic sauce, then dehydrated and turned into crispy crumbs which are used as garnish.\nIT’S NOT EASY BEING GREEN\nThe reduce, reuse and recycle mantra applies beyond food as well. In the last year, companies like Cicheti Ventures, The Lo & Behold Group and Spa Esprit Group have eliminated the use of single-use plastic straws, replacing them with reusable metal ones or straws made from biodegradable materials like tapioca.\nSimilarly, at the likes of Tiong Bahru Bakery, plastic bags are eschewed for reinforced paper bags, while plans are underway to replace plastic juice bottles with glass ones, said parent company Spa Esprit Group’s founder Cynthia Chua.\nIronically, sustainability is expensive and requires a substantial financial commitment. Because of factors like smaller economies of scale and higher compliance costs, eco-friendly options such as biodegradable packaging can cost up to three times the price of its eco-hazardous plastic counterparts.\nNorwegian fast-casual concept Pink Fish, which recently opened his first international outpost at Jewel Changi Airport, knows this well. It uses only biodegradable and compostable materials for its packaging, cutlery and crockery. “It costs three times more (than plastic), but if we want to be the change,” said CEO Ronny Gjose, “we must deliver.”\n\n\nA post shared by Pink Fish Singapore (@pinkfishsg)\nConvincing diners to pay a premium for these practices requires some creativity. But it helps that today’s diners take a genuine interest in the provenance of their food and drinks, how the produce is grown and the methods in which they are cooked.\nAll that makes for good stories – which are the lynchpin of good marketing – be they about honey from urban rooftop hives tended to by a former-banker-turned-beekeeper, or small-batch cheeses made by a lone fromager in a far-flung village in France. In sustainability terms, the road to a good story about produce leads back to traceability, an element that restaurants have also begun to focus on.\n\n\nA post shared by Unlisted Collection: (@unlistedc)\n“For us, it’s about reaching an audience who are concerned about sustainability, traceability and farm-to-table concepts,” said Loh Lik Peng, founder and director of Unlisted Collection, whose stable of restaurants include Nouri, Pollen and MeatSmith.\n“We work closely with farms so that we have much more integrity and options in terms of organic produce. This is important even in our meat-centric restaurants because people want to know where the meat is from, how the animals were treated and how they are smoked in the kitchens.”\n\n\nNATURALLY RESPONSIBLE\nThe push towards supporting sustainability has affected wine lists too. Increasingly, restaurants are spotlighting natural wines, which are farmed organically or bio-dynamically and made without any additives or processing aids. “Minimal human intervention yields the most interesting outcomes and showcases the grape varietal in their truest forms,” explained Ong Liling, director of Cicheti Ventures, whose establishments include Bar Cicheti and Fynn’s.\n“Not only that, by showcasing the winemakers, we are supporting a new way of farming that eradicates the use of pesticide and chemicals in the soil and sulphites that are usually added during the fermentation process. Again, the theme of bringing people back to nature is integral to the principle of sustainability.”\nNo doubt, sustainability is a tricky subject – every effort to do good seems to come with a contradiction. “You can buy all the organic produce in the world, for example, but if it comes wrapped in a lot of plastic, then what’s the point?” said Chef Julien Royer, who’s restaurant Odette recently won the mantle of Asia’s Best at the World’s 50 Best Restaurants Awards.\n“It’s hard to talk about sustainability in restaurants because it’s complicated. So I think for me, the most important thing is to ensure that we don’t waste anything.”\nUltimately, bearing responsibility for the planet’s wellbeing lies at the core of sustainability, and it is a journey that does not and should not have an endpoint. Like any great movement of change, sustainability involves immense time, effort, financial commitment and a shift in mind sets that must permeate an entire organisation.\nAnd as with all great things, the beginnings lie in the small steps. As Ong said, “[Adopting sustainability] is a process that must be consistently nurtured and I truly believe that as long as a restaurant does its best to minimise wastage – in food, water and electricity – then that in itself is already a huge step.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     food ', '     Restaurants ', '     Singapore ', '     sustainability ', '     Fine dining ']}"

      The new Culina at COMO Dempsey: Grocery shopping never looked this good
  </h1>, 'text': 'Jewel Changi Airport might currently be the island’s buzziest dining locale, but over in Dempsey Hill, a quiet storm has been brewing. There was the opening of lifestyle destination JAM at Siri House earlier this year; the introduction of pop-up natural wine bar Drunken Farmer at Open Farm Community; and the relocation of fine dining Chinese restaurant Min Jiang from its former Rochester Park home.\nThe district’s real jewel, though, has to be Culina at COMO Dempsey, which has also relocated from Block 8 to Block 15 to be closer to its COMO cousins, COMO Cuisine, The Dempsey Cookhouse & Bar, Ippoh Tempura Bar, Candlenut and Dover Street Market Singapore (the COMO Group acquired Culina in 2012).\n\n\nA post shared by Culina at COMO Dempsey (@culinacomodempsey)\nAt 15,000 sq. ft., Culina’s new home is two-and-a-half times bigger than its old digs, and the bistro now has space for 160 diners. Italian designer Paola Navone has given the cavernous, light-filled interior a casual chic, Parisian bistro vibe. Indeed, on any given day – the gourmet emporium opened the same week Jewel did – you could be forgiven for believing that you have stumbled upon an outpost of Le Bon Marche.\nThat is to say, Culina makes a worthy rival to the Left Bank institution (or at least, its food hall, La Grande Epicerie). Trawling the aisles of its Marketplace, you spy succulent cuts of beef from longtime suppliers Black Onyx and Westholme, as well as new label Margaret River Fresh Angus Beef. Perhaps you’re in the mood for lamb? Well, there’s New Zealand favourite Maori Lakes, purveyors of free-range, grass-fed critters.\nOver in the seafood section, your gaze falls upon fist-sized oysters from Royal and Perle Blanche (“White Pearl”), air-flown from France. (In a tasting arranged for members of the media, the molluscs proved to be fresh, creamy, plump and not too briny, with the Perle Blanche variety being fleshier and creamier than the Royals).\nFrom the House of Kaviari is a new product: Rope-hung and smoked Norwegian salmon. Smoked with beech wood, the fillets are vertically hung from a rope, a method that yields a tender texture.\nAlso new to Culina is a limited edition red prawn elixir from Rosso di Mazara, Message in the Bottle. Contained in what looks like a flask of cognac, the elixir is obtained by freeze-drying the heads of Sicilian red prawns to extract an ultra-pure essence.\nHaving sampled a dish made with these crimson-coloured crustaceans at Zafferano (the flavour is sweet, milky and creamy; think amaebi, but more luscious), one can only imagine the impact the elixir would have in a stock or broth. Perhaps when preparing prawn noodles or laksa, because why not?\nIn the fruit and veg aisle, uncommon produce such as heirloom tomatoes, Jerusalem artichokes, round yellow zucchinis, Japanese muskmelons, white asparagus and ramps (wild garlic leaves) vie for your attention. We’re told that we’ve just missed the season of Korean strawberries and matsutake mushrooms.\nIn its new digs, Culina is also diversifying to embrace more Asian produce and products. Entire shelves are devoted to Vietnamese fish sauces, Taiwanese soy sauces, and Korean marinades. Even the spirits offering is taking on an Asian persuasion: Sake is gradually being introduced alongside Old- and New World wines.\nWith such a bounty at his fingertips, Australian-born chef Timothy de Souza – who spent a decade in COMO Hotels and Resorts kitchens in the Caribbean and the Maldives, and who most recently headed COMO Cuisine – found himself in culinary heaven.\n“When you’ve got products this good, you try and honour them as best as possible,” he told CNA Luxury. “My cooking philosophy in general – and over the last 18 years – is that fresh produce is the cornerstone of all good food, no matter what.\n“Now that I’ve got this space and this Marketplace to use, the next six months are going to be interesting. We’ve had such a good following at Block 8, and now we want to try and bring something new to the table… while still remaining loyal to the flavours that everyone knows.\n“You’ll see a lot more changes on our daily specials menu where we will be highlighting the product, the producer, the seasonality of the vegetables etc. Right now we’re using white asparagus – they’re on our vegetable assiette. They have a short life span. In three weeks they’re going to be gone. At the moment we’re using ramps as well. Coming up we’ve got truffle season. All I’m going to be doing is honouring those products simply. Not too much purees, not too much colour. The products speak for themselves, and [I want to let] the flavours shine through on the plate.”\nThe best part about having the Bistro adjacent to the Marketplace is that you can select your choice ingredients, and then have de Souza and his team prepare them the way you like it. Just note the Bistro’s operation hours if you’re planning to do so in the month of May (only lunch and dinner service available; all-day dining from June onwards).\nCULINA MARKETWeekdays: 10am – 10pmWeekends and Public Holidays: 9am – 10pm\nCULINA BISTROMay: Daily, 11am – 3pm; 6pm – 11pm (Last order: 10pm)June onwards: Daily, 11am – 11pm (Last order: 10pm)Email: reservations [at] culina.com.sg ()\n', 'related_topics': ['     Restaurants ', '     food ', '     Singapore ', '     Fine dining ']}"

      Bangkok gastronomy: Taking street food to 'heavenly' sophistication
  </h1>, 'text': 'Chef Sujira “Aom” Pongmorn wants to take diners on an authentic Thai culinary journey, and she does it through her restaurant Saawaan, which means “Heaven”. “I love street food. Tourists want to come to Bangkok because of street food. We have many options for street food. I want to make it better with my ideas, and present it in a more luxurious way,” said Pongmorn.\nPongmorn also considers her vocation her contribution towards preserving a slice of Thailand’s intangible cultural heritage. “Some street food is going to die off or fade away, so I try to revive them. It’s like the mummy in the box,” she quipped.\nPongmorn previously worked in fine dining kitchens across Bangkok, including the Mandarin Oriental and Baan Phadthai, before establishing Saawaan, an intimate 30-seater restaurant in trendy Sathorn, to showcase her unique culinary perspective that blends modern techniques and traditional Thai hospitality.\n“I want Thai people to try to open their hearts and their minds to appreciate Thai food in another way. Here, we are creative and at the same time, there is good presentation, good service and good food. You see the chefs presenting the food themselves. It’s like you’re coming to our house; I want to create a feeling that Saawaan is like a family restaurant,” Pongmorn said.\nHer bold vision has earned Saawaan a one-Michelin star rating. But she had problems finding her footing initially.\n“It was a little hard because I’m a nobody; we didn’t come with prizes and awards,” she recounted. “The thing I found most challenging is getting the flavour that I want to present to people. I just want to make guests happy when they taste my food.”\nEach dish on the tasting menu focuses on a different cooking technique, and each dish uses only locally-sourced ingredients. Items on the menu include fermented beef with pickled cucumber and Thai herbs, and Samut Songkhram mud crab with Bai Liang (a leafy green vegetable also known as melindjo)\xa0 and bitter bean.\nPongmorn’s love for cooking began with a simple omelette. She was six, and her father had been too ill to prepare a meal for the family. “My dad said, ‘okay, you have to pick this and that, and use this and that, and mix them’,” she recalled.\nHer family of home cooks inspired her to push further by sharing their experience and techniques.\n“My dad and my aunt inspire me a lot with their cooking, so they are like my idols. Because the other chefs cannot cook like them. Their food is like wow. It’s like magic in your mouth all the time,” she exclaimed. “They taught me to pay attention to the details of each dish. They said the flavour and details of each ingredient should come first. And then you can focus on how you want to present the dish.”\nTwice a week, Pongmorn does a road trip up to Nakhon Pathom province to purchase seasonal produce. She is thinking of introducing new herbs and protein alternatives to her menu, and works closely with a particular organic farm to experiment with new plant varieties.\n“They don’t use any chemicals to feed the animals, or to grow the plants. That’s why we’re keen to bring their produce to Saawaan. Sometimes I need a new ingredient but these are plants that they do not have in their farm. They will grow them for my next project. So we have to plan ahead before we create a dish,” she explained of her process.\n“I think the part that I enjoy most is the way I present local food,” she said of her work. “But I want to present it in my style and elevate it to luxury fine-dining style. You take these dishes from the street and put on a crown. Give them a shower and get new clothes on them.”\nAdapted from the series Remarkable Living.

      Food is theatre for one of Melbourne's most innovative young chefs
  </h1>, 'text': 'A young chef with an excess of unconventional ideas in his head is not exactly a rarity in the restaurant business today. But very few can pull them off without making them seem gimmicky, or as memorably as Shaun Quade did at his Melbourne restaurant, Lume.\nQuade has been hailed by the media as one of the most exciting and innovative chefs today. He also has got his technical culinary skills down pat – he started as a chef at age 21, became the executive chef of a five-star hotel when he turned 23, and started his own restaurant at age 32.\nSince opening its doors in 2015, Lume, located in south Melbourne, has steadily won the critics’ favour and established a solid reputation for innovation. It’s also managed to get on everyone’s lips with the unusual way it presented its most iconic dish – Meyer Lemon Tree, a dessert Quade unveiled with a journey to the ingredients’ point of origins via a VR headset, is now famous for its multi-sensory mode of delivery.\nWhether diners had a good or bad time seemed irrelevant to Quade, but what’s important is that each of them walks out of his restaurant “feeling like they’ve had an experience that they couldn’t have had anywhere else”. The worst thing that could happen? “If one of our guests walked out and is indifferent to the experience.”\nHis culinary vision goes far beyond the taste and smell of a dish. He explained: “I always try, through the dishes, to get people to imagine something. It’s like creating new memories. You know, I think that’s really, really powerful – it’s actually having someone come in here and try something or be told a story through a dish that’s completely new to them and then they go back out into the world and spread the word.\n“The biggest compliment for me would be for someone to come in that’s like, ‘Oh I don’t eat the oysters’ or ‘I don’t eat this, I don’t eat that’, and then they try it in the context of the dish that I’ve made and you know they become a convert.”\nMost people who have dined at Lume will find its exterior surprisingly unassuming for a fine-dining restaurant. What they most likely didn’t know was that Quade specifically wanted it to not look like a restaurant so that he could build something more personal for diners.\n“The front of the restaurant – you’d never know there’s a restaurant there, which we did on purpose because it is just like going to someone’s house for dinner. Everything here is a reflection of my personal beliefs and style and philosophy,” he explained.\nQuade also revealed that the restaurant’s name, Lume, doesn’t mean anything: “I chose that because it’s a nice-sounding word and also because I wanted people to come here with a clean slate, clean expectations.” The only thing diners can safely expect of the restaurant and its chef? It’s that they will be endlessly evolving and innovating.\nAdapted from the series Remarkable Living.

      Visiting Scandinavia? Make a pitstop in Helsinki, its new gastronomic destination
  </h1>, 'text': 'From the whimsical skylights that protrude like reptilian eyes from its new underground art museum to the undulating walls of a new library, Helsinki’s latest attractions are resolutely cutting-edge. So it came as something of a relief, on a recent trip to the Finnish capital, to spot a homely pastry in bakery windows throughout the city. Tube-shaped and topped with a circle of ruby red jam, this is a Runeberg cake, and it’s eaten to commemorate the birthday of Finland’s national poet, Johan Runeberg, who was born on Feb 5, 1804.\nThat a poet would get his own national baked good is reason enough, as far as I’m concerned, to recommend Finnish gastronomy. But happily, there are a growing number of other reasons as well. Helsinki has been slower to the Nordic revolution that has turned Copenhagen and Stockholm into global culinary destinations. But the same surge of creativity that has brought the city the Amos Rex contemporary art museum and the architecturally stunning Oodi library has extended to cuisine as well.\n“When I first got here about seven years ago, there were a few fine-dining restaurants and a lot of fast food, but nothing in between,” said Barcelona-born Albert Franch Sunyer (he is a co-owner of Restaurant Nolla, which is closed as it rebuilds in a new location, slated to open this summer). “But I left to travel for a year in 2015, and when I came back, it was like, ‘Wow, what happened?’ Suddenly there were all these new kinds of places, and a younger generation of chefs starting their own businesses. Even the customers were different – they were more willing to go out.”\nThe innovations tend to be of degree – they exalt Finland’s limited but superlative produce and eschew luxury ingredients like shellfish and beef in favour of wild plants and offcuts of proteins – rather than kind. (In the winter, you will see a lot of root vegetables. In the spring and summer, herbs and berries.)\nAnd there’s still some mimicry of Nordic trends from Denmark and Sweden. “Food culture is new here, so it’s difficult not to mirror what you see elsewhere,” said Franch. “It’s like when you’re a kid, you copy your parents until inevitably, you develop your own identity.” Increasingly in Helsinki, that inevitability is coming into focus.\nORA\nIn 2010, the mostly self-taught chef Sasu Laukkonen opened a tiny neighborhood restaurant called Chef and Sommelier, and quickly turned it into one of Helsinki’s most acclaimed restaurants. Seven years later, he reopened in the same space as Ora, with a menu even more fervently devoted to Finnish ingredients, and a kitchen reconstructed to take advantage of every centimetre of available space.\nOra is still small enough that guests have to time their trips to the restroom so as not to block the servers. But the intimate dining room makes the perfect stage for Laukkonen. A one-man rebuke to the stereotype of the reticent Finn, he slips back and forth behind a kitchen counter that also serves as a table, plating on the one side and multilingually regaling diners on the other with stories about the Finnish loggers who used to load up on the Arctic turnips he says are like rutabagas, but sweeter; or the seasonal burbot, a chimera-like fish with the head of a catfish, the tail of an eel and a liver that tastes like that of a monkfish.\nThose products are featured to excellent effect on the six-course tasting menu. Thin slices of Arctic turnip are rolled like golden crepes around a sweetly creamy filling of whitefish, drizzled with dill oil, and topped with scoop of whitefish roe. The opaline burbot, delicate in its buttery sauce, gets an earthy base from local carrots spiced with caraway. A warming dish of celeriac, shaved into pappardelle and slathered in a cream sauce brightened with a foresty pine bark vinegar, is as soothing as a bowl of pasta al limone, but far more interesting.\nWith the exception of the wines, which generally come from small producers elsewhere in Europe, everything that Ora serves, from a sparkling hard cider the colour of spun gold that inaugurates the meal to the rosemary-scented crumble topped with whey ice cream and a disk of local chocolate that ends it, is pristinely, gloriously Finnish.\nSix-course tasting menu, €89 (S$136); additional €65 for wine pairing\norarestaurant.fi\nINARI\nLike “former prime minister” and “former porn star,” the title “former chef at Noma” is one not easily discarded. Yet Kim Mikkola and Evelyn Kim, who met while they were both working at the famed Copenhagen restaurant, have managed to carve a distinct identity for themselves right out of the gate. The combination of references from his Finnish background with those from her Korean-American one makes for dishes that disarm with their idiosyncrasies before winning you over with their daring flavours. This is cooking with a clear point of view.\nYou wouldn’t expect it upon entering Inari. Physically, the restaurant could hardly be more nondescript: in chilly months, the ground-level windows let in little light, rendering all the plainer the bare walls and unadorned tables. But it hardly matters, because from the first dish, it all turns. Precise wedges of crisp daikon alternate with segments of grapefruit that shimmer in a pool of quince; the sweet, tart and spiciness of the components are melded together by earthy shards of black garlic. Korean tteokbokki (rice cakes with the shape and texture of very al dente gnocchi) – bathe in a briny mussel broth that pops thanks to a healthy dollop of salmon roe. Shiitake and enoki mushrooms, strewn among globules of a lightly gelled aspic made from clean-tasting chicken broth, are served cold, invigorated, like many of Inari’s dishes, with a pow of chili oil.\nThe surprises continue further along the tasting menu: burbot makes an appearance again, swimming this time in a loose turnip foam that hides leaves of seaweed – a decidedly modern take on a classic Finnish stew made with spinach and cream; tender slabs of sweetbreads get a jolt of honeyed tartness from persimmons. For dessert, that most Finnish of fruits, lingonberry, comes to the table as an ice cream dressed in a frill of crisp pastry and red bean paste.\nThere are no petit fours to finish off the meal, just as there was no bread to start it, and between those ruptures with local custom, and Mikkola and Kim’s sometimes startling flavour combinations, it’s no wonder that some Finns don’t quite know what to make of the place. But make no mistake: The cooking at Inari is utterly idiosyncratic – and utterly delicious.\nSeven-course tasting menu, €70; additional €40 for wine pairing.\nravintolainari.fi\nANDREA\nThe eight-headed, silk and bamboo dragon by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei that greets guests is the first clue: The St. George hotel makes a strong bid to be Helsinki’s most cosmopolitan accommodation. More proof comes in the restaurant one floor below, which is overseen by Mehmet Gurs, the chef of Istanbul’s Mikla restaurant.\nWith its low lighting, chocolate velvet chairs and smoky grey walls, Andrea is a sophisticated spot, and at lunchtime its tables fill with fashionably dressed businesspeople. Like Gurs himself, who is the child of a Turkish father and Swedish-Finnish mother, the menu at Andrea is something of a mashup. But rather than fusion cuisine, with all the haphazard blending the word implies, Andrea serves highly polished Turkish dishes made with Finnish ingredients.\nOr at least mostly. An exception starts the meal in the form of the house-baked bread – instead of a warm pide, it’s a proper sourdough served, in the Nordic way, on a slab of polished tree trunk with freshly churned salted butter on the side. From there, though, the flavours change quickly to the bright, supple tastes of the Mediterranean. The mezze, or small plates meant to be shared, belie their apparent simplicity: From the lush muhammara, a walnut-and-red-pepper paste slicked with fruity olive oil to a chicken salad spiked with kebab spices to a stew of smoky braised eggplant sparked with tomato and tiny, nutty chickpeas.\nMains are built largely around the grill that is the star cooking technique of the Anatolian kitchen, whether a simple skewer of lamb, its edges perfectly charred, its interior still rosy; or a thick curl of octopus, the tentacle glazed sweet and smoky with pomegranate molasses. But throughout, there are hints that we are far from the Bosporus. That lamb skewer, for example, is served with a dollop of cicek, the traditional herb-flecked yogurt, but instead of fresh cucumbers, it’s spiked with very Nordic pickled ones. A starter of perfectly cured salmon, the flesh pink and plush, is beautifully offset by its own pickles – in this case tart green apples – and an emulsion of the same fruit that is like the best apple sauce you’ve ever tasted. A final dusting of sumac transforms it into something far more cosmopolitan than its parts.\nChef’s menu, €52.\nandreahelsinki.com\nGRON\nIn many ways, Gron is an amalgam of every trend to hit the Nordic restaurant scene in the past few years. Here, for example, is the minuscule open kitchen heavily populated with cooks who periodically put down their tweezers to bring out food; there is the tasting menu punctuated with words like “ramson capers” and “fermented.” Natural wines; housemade sourdough; plant-based, seasonal and organic? Check, check and check.\nBut Gron distinguishes itself as well. Once again, its room is small and bare, with wall-mounted shelves serving as spice storage, and not in a decorative way. But the service, whether from one of two dedicated servers or from a chef, is warm and knowledgeable, and the atmosphere is much more relaxed, friendly bistro than cold, serious temple of dining.\nAnd for a Nordic, chef Toni Kostian takes an unusually maximalist approach to cooking. That sourdough (which is exemplary – the restaurant has its own bakery across town) comes to the table not only with butter, but with little pots of spiced pumpkin seeds, and sweet cicely-flavoured salt as well. A perfect potato rosti, the exterior golden and crunchy, the interior pale and creamy, is topped with buttery oyster mushrooms, dusted in dried reindeer powder, and served with fresh baby sorrel and a sour cream that turns it into the Finnish latke of your dreams. A dense almond cake, piped with spruce-scented Swiss meringue and set aflame tableside, is irresistible on its own, and even more so with the puckery preserved blueberry compote that accompanies it.\nNot everything works – a savoury tart filled with roasted and raw yellow beets, lovage pesto, Swedish Vasterbotten cheese, celeriac and pickled horseradish flowers suffers from a few too many ingredients, and the gelatinous texture of glazed cod tongues is not enhanced by equally slippery braised cabbage. But an evening at Gron is still filled with convivial discoveries, and by the time a chef sends you off into the snowy night with a warm cannele, the crisp pastry redolent with the scent of woodruff, the sense of well-being is pronounced. Even poetic.\nFour-course tasting menu €58. \nrestaurantgron.com\nBy Lisa Abend © 2019 The New York Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     Finland ', '     dining ', '     gastronomy ', '     food ', '     Travel ', '     Luxury Destinations ', '     Places & Attractions ']}"

      What happens when you pit a Master Sommelier against a Master of Wine
  </h1>, 'text': ""In the world of wine, the two highest qualifications that certifies one’s professional wine knowledge are the Master of Wine (MW) and the Master Sommelier (MS) titles.\nThe MW is meant to be more academic than the MS, but both qualifications are gruelling – each taking at least three years to complete – and are extremely difficult to attain. As a result, there are only 383 Masters of Wine and 279 Master Sommeliers in the world today.\nOur little red dot can lay claim to one of the 279: Mathias Camilleri (who is of French-Chinese Singaporean extraction), who heads the team of sommeliers at CE LA VI.\nIn a bid to share “the similarities and differences between an MS and MW in a fun and meaningful way”, he has conceptualised a friendly showdown dinner. The face-off will take place at CE LA VI on Apr 22, 2019.\nThe exclusive 12-guest charity dinner and auction will be held to honour Gerard Basset, an international wine legend who attained both MS and MW titles, and who passed away in January this year.\nPriced at S$368++ per guest, each course of the six-course menu will be paired with two wines that have been handpicked by Camilleri and China-based MW Fongyee Walker respectively.\nGuests will not be told who chose which wines, but their favourite pairings will be tabulated. The one with the highest number of votes at the end of the evening wins, and the 12 wines will then be up for auction.\nCamilleri told CNA Luxury that he had been thinking about this concept for a couple of years. But things only started to fall in place after he met Walker, who is the co-founder of Dragon Phoenix Wine Consulting, Beijing’s first independent wine consulting and wine education agency.\n“Many times I hear from people who are interested in [embarking on] a wine program: Which [MS or MW] is the best? My answer is always neither, because these two programs have their own visions, the same levels of professionalism but suit different profiles of people and expectations,” Camilleri shared.\n“For me, the MW program is much more academic and promotes the knowledge of the art, science and business of wine. The MS program is concerned more about what is happening in the restaurant and trains sommeliers to understand, recommend and serve the guests in the most optimal conditions,” he added.\nFor the dinner, Camilleri and Walker have both chosen a diverse variety of wines to pair with each course, with labels from Spain and South Africa to even Lebanon and China. A dish of Fermented Plums, for instance, is paired with a 2010 Chenin Blanc from Stellenbosch; Little Neck Clams, with a 2016 Penedes from Catalonia; David Blackmores Wagyu Beef, with a 2015 Cabernet Sauvignon from Ningxia; and the same dish with a 2006 Chateau Musar from Lebanon's Bekaa Valley.\xa0\nWithout giving away too much, Camilleri explained their selection process, “I wanted to oppose Fongyee yet showcase my skills in the most impartial way. So without tasting [the menu], we used our memory and experiences of wine and ingredient flavours in order to make the pairing.\n“It was actually funny to see what we both selected, how our interpretation of a dish and expectations can be different or similar. There was a dish where we actually selected the exact same wine! Ultimately, I think our selection is diverse, with some great surprises that reflect both our personalities.”\nHowever, Camilleri reiterated that the evening is not about determining who is the best. Rather, the session is meant to be an informative wine dinner that gives a peek into how two wine professionals pair wine with food.\nHe noted, “We wish to share our passion for wines through an interactive wine dinner. Our guests would have two propositions of wine for each courses from two wine professionals coming from different backgrounds. There would be a bit of education but the main purpose is to enjoy a great food and wine experience.”\nTo make a reservation for this dinner, email reservationsg [at] celavi.com () or call +65 6508 2188\n"", 'related_topics': ['     gastronomy ', '     food ', '     charity ', '     auction ', '     Fine dining ']}"

      Unique food trails: Ming Tan sniffs out Mongolia's meat markets
  </h1>, 'text': 'When Ming Tan and his best friend Justin Chow went to Ulaanbaatar in October 2017 to test-run a burger pop-up brand in a city cafe and cook a high-end private meal for a client, they wondered, at times, if they had bitten off more than they could chew.\nTan, who is currently the executive chef of Jam at Siri House, and Chow, chief marketing officer of digital healthcare provider Whitecoat Gobal and co-founder of private investment platform Fundnel, had to understand the Mongolian F&B supply chain, visit markets for produce, and source ingredients through various fixers – and it was their first visit to the country.\nFortunately, the duo was well taken care of by their clients, who hosted them for meals and brought them to well-known restaurants, hidden spaces and late night karaoke joints.\nAmong them was Hana Sushi at Monnis Tower, the private restaurant of a Mongolian tycoon that was helmed by a Tokyo chef and served “high quality Japanese food, amazing fish and great tasting sushi rice”.\nPopular Rosewood Kitchen + Enoteca lived up to its highly-ranked reputation on Tripadvisor with its hearty European dishes made mostly from scratch from good quality local ingredients. It also ran a grocery shop selling freshly baked bagels and all kinds of local meat.\n\n\nAnd at what Tan regards as “probably the best South Asian restaurant in Ulaanbaatar”, the always-crowded Namaste scored full marks for its freshly cooked naan and hot curries at authentic spice levels.\nBut the one item that stole Tan’s stomach was the ubiquitous Mongolian dumpling khuushuur – deep-fried curry puffs stuffed with chives and spiced pork, lamb or beef – that was found in every bar, restaurant, and store that Tan and Chow visited.\nTan says, “Some were small, like the size of an egg, and others about the dimension of a modern smartphone. Whether I was cold, drunk, hungry or full, awake or half-asleep, every khuushuur I consumed was offered with a smile, served piping hot and tasted damn delicious. In my mind it is the best representation of a Mongolian dish.”\nIronically it was the work part that supplied all the fun. One of their liaisons in Ulaanbaatar was heavily tattooed and pierced Chef Mars, who, together with their driver Tumurr, a large middle-aged man with broad shoulders, huge hands and a beer belly, took the pair to various places to buy their goods.\nIn one nondescript warehouse filled with Japanese and Korean products, Tan found himself confounded by butter, milk, cheese, and cured meats wrapped in packaging covered in Cyrillic script. He said with amusement, “It was a goldmine for the curious foodie or chef, but hell for someone trying to cook with these ingredients.”\nIn another warehouse advertising “imported foreign goods”, boxes of pasta and cereal were stacked perilously high next to jars of pickles, jams, and anchovies, while imitation caviar in glass jars sit beside local cheeses bobbing in murky whey.\n“The hall lacked the squawk and cackle of a busy hub of exchange,” recalled Tan. “I could just as easily be buying ammunition and Kevlar kneepads as I am looking for mayonnaise here.”\nTopping the weird and wonderful list was Huchit Shonhor wholesale meat market, a popular place that was somehow constantly referred by Tan’s fixers as a “black market”. He later found out that not all the meat in the market was institutionally inspected; a good half was sold via trading with nomadic herders with the meat slaughtered at an abattoir just behind the market.\nThe cluster of squarish single-storey buildings was located away from the city centre, and each building housed around 20 meat sellers, each manning open food chillers displaying various cuts of beef, lamb and camel, with some camel tomahawk steak cuts as large as a small adult.\nTan found the place surprisingly clean. Nothing was wet due to the ambient temperature of one degree Celsius. “There was no signs of rot, no whiff of funk. Just a constant, very noticeable meatiness coupled with the smell of cattle, like a very buttery-smelling zoo.”\nThe vendors, mostly stern-looking women dressed in uniforms with matching Mos Burger-style caps, presided over their chillers, which had cards with prices scrawled on them. One yelled at Tan when he took one photograph too many. “I have only felt similar shame bumping into fishmongers in Tsukiji and touching lobsters without permission in Noryangjin.”\nWhat was even more astonishing was the price. Well marbled, plump and boneless shortrib slabs were retailing for under S$3 a kilo and nothing was “dripping or flabby except from the beef fur that needs to be removed prior to cooking”.\n\n\nWith autumn temperatures hovering at zero degrees Celsius all day, everything was packed swiftly, without wrapping, into plastic bags. Every customer was shouldering a carcass of some kind, be it an entire lamb or the legs of a cow. Tan even saw someone nonchalantly throw a lamb carcass into the boot of a large BMW X5 before driving away.\n“We paid what seems to be a ridiculously low amount for whole primal cuts of beef to grind for our burgers,” said Tan. “The patties we made from them were phenomenally tasty, with a rounded beefiness that I still remember clear as day.”\nAll these local interactions precisely make up what Tan feels food should be about: people.\nHe said, “A memorable food journey should include experiences of how locals buy, cook and eat their food. I love visiting places near food markets, where you can often find a thriving economy of kitchenware shops, and I get fascinated learning how food is grown and gets into someone’s mouth.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     food ', '     gastronomy ', '     Singapore ', '     Fine dining ', '     Profiles ', '     Activities ']}"

      Keong Saik's latest dining destination: Pasta, craft beers and an elBulli chef
  </h1>, 'text': 'It’ll be the hottest address on Keong Saik Road when it\'s officially launched later this month. And that’s because the 60-room flexible-living concept that is KeSa House is also home to a group of six new food and beverage concepts, many of which are already open for business.\nIf you\'re wondering, ""flexible-living concept"" in this case is a slight deviation from the usual hotel experience, targeted at guests looking to stay a little longer, and / or those who enjoy the social nature of communal living spaces.\nKeSa House isn\'t look-down-your-nose fancy\xa0– and neither are the F&B options in the line-up. There\'s something for everyone,\xa0which was the plan all along, said\xa0Ashish Manchharam, founder and managing director of 8M Real Estate and 8M Collective, the boutique real estate investment company that owns and manages the property.\n“We don’t want to ‘just fit in’ to the neighbourhood’s already dynamic character,” said Manchharam. “We want to enhance its existing charm and create a long-standing destination.”\nThe focus, said\xa0Manchharam,\xa0is on offering well-priced, quality dishes that appeal to a wider band of consumers.\nOlivia Restaurant & Lounge, for example, is ideal for those seeking well-executed\xa0Mediterranean cuisine, while the\xa0Pasta Bar\xa0is designed to be a casual neighbourhood Italian restaurant that brings the culture of counter dining to life.\nThe former is a partnership between elBulli alumni, chef Alain Devahive, and fellow Spaniard Miquel Sabria, who is the restaurant’s chief operating officer and sommelier.\n“We wanted this to be an all-day destination,” said Sabria, who feels that too many restaurants in the area are appealing to the dinner crowd. The menu, Devahive explained, celebrates the inspired, cosmopolitan culinary tapestry that the Catalan city of Barcelona is known for.\nThe Pasta Bar, in turn, helmed by Genovan native Alessandro Giustetti, pairs handmade pasta with recipes passed down through generations. It’s as unfussy as it sounds. But\xa0you don’t really need to oversell a good Italian restaurant – its appeal is universal.\n\n\nINTERNATIONAL APPEAL\nAccording to Manchharam, over a year was spent curating the ideal mix of concepts for KeSa House, which occupies a stretch of 10 shophouses.\n“I’ve had a passion for shophouses for a long time. Their architecture and historical and cultural significance, combined with their central locations, create attractive opportunities for businesses to set themselves apart – and for us at 8M Real Estate to create unique spaces for consumers to enjoy,” he shared, before stressing that “the inherent nature of conservation shophouses is attractive to F&B operators because they are able to create strong individual identities for their concepts”.\nThis is particularly advantageous for brands that thrive on having a unique environment; concepts that also aim to be destinations.\xa0The Guild, for example, is a project by one of Hong Kong’s largest independent craft breweries. A craft beer bar and restaurant headed by chef Vincent Lauria, it pairs comfort food with a comprehensive offering of independent craft beer labels, cocktails, and natural wines.\nTrue to its endorsed ethos, The Guild works with small-scale, artisanal producers, including farmers, distillers and winemakers, and in building a community of like-minded consumers.\nNow, if you’re into the trendy concepts that have helped put Hong Kong’s drinks culture on the world map, you’d probably already know that the founders behind the city’s feted cocktail bar,\xa0The Old Man – ranked No 5 and No 10 on the\xa0Asia’s 50 Best Bars\xa0and\xa0The World’s 50 Best Bars\xa0lists, respectively – have opened its first overseas branch in Singapore, at KeSa House.\nThe reason, they shared, was simple: “Singapore is Asia’s cocktail capital, so there’s no better place to be.”\nLed by partner and head bartender Andrew Yap, The Old Man Singapore carries over its Hong Kong counterpart’s unique concept, which pays homage to Ernest Hemingway’s Pulitzer Prize-winning fictional work, The Old Man and the Sea.\nIn the spirit of the famed author’s sophisticated taste for a well-made drink, the bar specialises in experimental cocktails inspired by his preferred libations and works. From the “Best Of The Old Man” list of drinks, which take their name from Hemingway’s classics, there is one to try called The Sun Also Rises that features a tropical concoction of coconut oil fat-washed applejack, curry leaf-infused gin, sweet vermouth, sous-vide pandan leaves, and kaffir lime.\n\n\nLOCAL\xa0INSTITUTIONS\nOf course, it wouldn’t be an inclusive line-up without at least a couple of homegrown names. Serving modern French bistro-styled fare,\xa0Mag’s Wine Kitchen, for one, is almost an institution, spending 23 years on Circular Road before moving its operations to this buzzy Keong Saik address.\n“The premise behind our cuisine will always be simplicity, using the freshest ingredients in the market,” said its owner, banker-turned-chef Magdalene Tang. Its dishes will no doubt go well with its extensive wine selection of mostly Old World winners, some New World alternatives and even sake.\nUltimately, the selection of F&B concepts at KeSa House plays an important role in championing two key ambitions: The preservation of a local architectural legacy that is the Singapore shophouse, and the affirmation of the island’s reputation as a destination brimming with uniquely scrumptious wining and dining experiences.\n', 'related_topics': ['     food ', '     Singapore ', '     gastronomy ']}"

      From sleeping on the streets of Paris to owning a Michelin starred restaurant
  </h1>, 'text': 'For Alan Geaam, cooking isn’t a vocation but a way of life, connecting him to his Lebanese roots and offering solace in times of distress.\n“I came to Paris on the second of March 1999. I had just my bag, a small bag,” said Alan Geaam. With that singular worldly possession, and all but 200 francs (the equivalent of €60 today, or S$92) in his pocket, Geaam couldn’t afford to stay in a hotel, and instead slept under the watchful eye of the Eiffel Tower.\nIn a city where food, like its fashion, is high art, and in a discipline that demands nothing but the best, Geaam has inched one step closer to the pantheon of culinary greats by scoring a Michelin star in 2018, a year that saw 54 new restaurants awarded one Michelin star.\nBorn in Liberia to Lebanese parents, “life was very hard” for Geaam. At 19, he left home and made his way to Paris where he worked two jobs – as a construction worker during the day, and another as a pizza delivery boy and dishwasher at night to eke out a living.\nThe hardworking Geaam never said no to work. He went in early to work and would finish the day very late. He explained: “I worked all the time. Christmas, New Year, all the holidays I worked.” But more than that, from his work at the restaurant, he “learned from them, helped them, eat, taste the food”.\nHis luck would change when the pizza restaurant’s chef accidentally hurt himself, and Geaam took over the cooking for the evening without having been asked. The restaurant’s patrons were delighted with the food, while Geaam found his “bonheur [happiness] and… dream in France” doing what he loved best – “cooking for others”.\nGeaam had never trained under a chef, nor did he go to culinary school. Instead, he taught himself how to “cook French food in the restaurant”. He added: “I never used Lebanese flavours in my kitchen, I never took risks, I always cooked what other chefs were cooking. They use yuzu, I put yuzu. They use buratta, I used buratta.”\nThe chef who never took risks says his first memory of food was “one plate my mother she cooked when I was young.” That one plate of “chicken with chou [cabbage], with tomatoes, with a little bit of spice and rice” was a plate full of emotion – “can’t tell you how much emotions,” added Geaam. Till today, thirty-five years later, the memory of that plate stays with him.\nHe also never forgot his roots or the flavours of home. The one thing, he says, that travelled with him between Liberia and Lebanon “is the food – the spices, the flavour”. Not only did he keep his memory of food alive, it also kept him going. He said: “Food saved my life. Actually even now I find peace in the food.” Whenever he was nervous or stressed, he would “go to the kitchen and try to cook and I would be very quiet, very calm”.\nNow, Geaam says he wants to make French food with Lebanese flavours because “it’s like a gift for my mother, from all the love she gave to me, I want to give it back.” Her love taught him to express his love for people through the food he cooks for them.\nHe is humbled that he is recognised for his work, adding that “Michelin can also give the star to somebody who never make… cuisine or work in the palace [sic]. This is Paris, a gastronomy capital… with many big chefs and now, it’s my turn to be among these chefs. It’s fantastic.”\nAdapted from the series Remarkable Living.

      Inside the high-tech operations of Singapore’s largest egg farm
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Retail prices have risen recently. There is a possibility that Malaysia may limit its egg exports. But the managing director of this local egg farm has not stopped worrying.\nFor one thing, although eggs are fetching more, the price increase over the years has not kept up with overall inflation, says Mr Koh Yeow Koon, 43.\nSeng Choon Farm is the Republic’s largest egg farm, meeting about 12 per cent of the market demand here.\nBut Mr Koh doubts that his or any local farm can begin to compete with Malaysian farms in terms of cost, which means a limit to sales.\n“There’s only a certain proportion of the market that’s willing to pay the higher price for the fresher, higher-quality eggs that Singapore farms produce,” he says.\n“I think the amount of people willing to accept Singapore eggs is only about 30 per cent.”\nThat figure is just a tad higher than their current 27-per-cent share of consumption, from the 521 million eggs produced locally in 2017.\nMr Koh cites Singapore’s higher land, labour, utilities and compliance costs. But what it is that worries him more is the “increasing competition from farms that are doing one to two million eggs a day overseas”.\nHis farm produces 600,000 eggs daily from its 850,000 chickens. And the numbers overseas matter because “we’re increasingly seeing technology being catered for big farms”.\n“It’s for sustainability and survival that we need to constantly upgrade our technology,” he explains. “So whether we like it or not, we have to be in the race. We have to adopt all this large-scale automation.”\nTechnology and automation are the factors in the resurgence of agriculture in Singapore. And that has been no different for Seng Choon since it moved to its 36-acre farmland (27 football fields) in Lim Chu Kang in 2010.\nBut just how is automation being used to supply Singaporeans with their eggs daily? Here are several ways, big and small, as CNA Insider discovered in an exclusive inside look at Seng Choon Farm.\nWATCH: Inside Singapore\'s largest egg farm (5:34)\n1. HOW THE HENS ARE FED\nClose to 100 tonnes of specially formulated feeds are prepared each day in the farm’s feed mill, with about a dozen tanks of various sizes needed to store the raw ingredients, like soya bean, maize and wheat.\nSome materials such as maize come in big pieces, so they must first be chopped up in the hammer mill.\nAt the heart of the whole feed mill is the control room, where a computer weighs what is needed of each ingredient to get the correct proportion for each feed.\n“They’ll get mixed in a mixer … into the proper nutrition that the chickens need,” says Mr Koh.\nThe feed is sent by conveyor to all the hen houses – a job that used to be done manually and by truck – and is given to the hens five times a day by automatic dispensers.\n“This control room seems to be getting smaller and smaller because, over the years, we keep putting in more equipment to reduce the amount of labour that’s involved,” Mr Koh adds.\n2. THE FEED DETERMINES THE\xa0EGG\xa0TYPE\nDifferent chickens are given different feeds to produce a range of products, including carrot eggs and Omega-3 eggs, which are enriched with different vitamins and minerals.\n“For example, if we feed the chickens with fish oil or Omega-3 enriched oils, they’d be able to pass these lipids into the egg yolk,” says Mr Koh.\n“We can get lower-cholesterol eggs, or higher in vitamin D, and all this is done via our experience in feed varying.”\nThese specialty eggs are easily machine-sorted because they are packed at separate times.\nThere are, however, variations in the nutrients available in the eggs because the chicken “isn’t a machine”, and to a degree, this may also depend on the breed.\n3. HOW THE HENS ARE HOUSED\nThe poultry houses are fully enclosed, each having four to six tiers and holding between 30,000 to 50,000 chickens. These are unlike the open and naturally ventilated structures of the past, which had two tiers.\n“The temperature is better controlled because it’s enclosed,” says Mr Koh.\n“So it may be 33 or 34 degrees outside, but we’re able to keep temperatures in the chicken sheds at 29 to 30°C with the use of evaporating cooling pads and controlled fans.”\nWith computers maintaining a stable temperature range, “the chickens are cooler and have better welfare”. There are even cages with light-emitting diodes and dimmers to mimic natural light by slowly brightening early in the day and darkening at dusk.\nThe manure is collected via conveyor and brought to a central treatment area to be converted into compost.\nImportantly, as egg farmers in Singapore are not allowed to use antibiotics on their hens, the enclosed houses help to ensure that there is no “interference from outside factors that may spread diseases to the chickens”.\nStaff and visitors need to go through disinfection before entering the chicken sheds.\n4. HOW EGGS ARE COLLECTED AND GRADED\nThe cages are gently sloped, and the eggs roll down to a conveyor as they are laid. From the houses, the belts lead to an egg collection centre, where they graded and sorted.\nVisibly broken or leaking eggs are taken out by hand, before a state-of-the-art grading machine does the job of quality control of 120,000 eggs an hour.\nThe eggs go through its series of cameras, which take 16 different pictures of each egg as it rolls along the belt. “If the eggs are dirty, they’re sent to a different lane to be processed differently,” says Mr Koh.\nAfter the “egg inspector” comes the “crack detector”, which can even check for hairline cracks that would escape the human eye. It does this by acoustic detection – measuring the sound from light taps (16 times as well) on the eggs.\n“Previously this was done by visual inspection. So what they’d do is shine a very bright light. But after some time, people get so tired that they miss the cracks,” he adds.\nThen the eggs are passed through ultraviolet light\xa0to disinfect the shell surface, followed by individual weighing and the final step in the grading process: The blood spot detector.\n“Blood spots are naturally occurring in some eggs. It’s a very small percentage … probably 0 .05 per cent,” explains Mr Koh. “It’s natural, but then, consumers just don’t like to see it inside their eggs.”\nThe machine detects these eggs by shining a very bright light and removes them, “but machines being machines, there may still be two to three per cent of eggs that are missed”.\n5. WHAT AUTOMATION MEANS FOR MANPOWER\nAfter packing, the eggs are put into crates, which a robotic arm would carry from the conveyor and stack into pallets for delivery.\n“This used to be done manually by one or two persons, who worked from day to night,” says Mr Koh. “Every day, we had to change to a different person.”\nFaced with labour shortages that were bound to get worse, the management knew automation was a must.\n“So for the past 10 years, we’ve done a lot of automation projects relating to every single facet of the farm,” adds Mr Koh, the youngest child of its chairman Koh Swee Lai, who founded Seng Choon in 1987.\n“On the office side, we’ve changed the IT system. Even on the delivery side, we’ve issued them with personal digital assistants … They don’t need to memorise all the prices, which are changing every week.”\nIn fact, his father had gone on many trips to the United States and Europe since the farm’s inception to study new farming technologies. But it was only after Seng Choon’s relocation that they could “design the farm around automation”.\nEgg production has doubled to its current output. “And the good thing about all this automation is that we’ve maintained our workforce size of about 100-plus people,” he says.\n“Everyone knows each other, so it’s quite a nice working environment with a good size.”\nThe scale of automation also means farming has become ""more and more complex"" now, but he has no doubt that Seng Choon must stay at the forefront of technology adoption to remain on the lower production-cost curve.\n', 'related_topics': ['     animals ', '     food ', '     CNA Insider ']}"

      Siew mai goes high tech: Singapore's first cell-based shrimp dumplings launched
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Singapore\'s first cell-based meat venture Shiok Meats lifted the lid on its lab-grown\xa0shrimp dumplings at the Disruption in Food and Sustainability Summit (DFSS)\xa0on Friday (Mar 29).\nThere were just eight dumplings\xa0showcased at the summit, but\xa0the high-tech dim sum\xa0took months and S$5,000 to cook up.\nOnly three people\xa0at the unveiling got a taste - all three are advisors of Shiok Meats, a food tech start-up that focuses on growing seafood from stem cells.\xa0The Shiok Shrimp Dumpling is their first product.\n“It tastes like siew mai!” said Good Food Institute APAC managing director Elaine Siu.\nAnother advisor,\xa0CEO of Monde Nissin Henry Soesanto said the dumplings were ""very promising"".\nAll this reporter got was a whiff as Shiok Meats CTO Ling Ka Yi took the dumplings\xa0out of a\xa0steamer. Yes, they did smell like shrimp.\n""The three advisors who tasted it, they definitely said that it tasted like shrimp. So we’re very happy,"" said Shiok Meats CEO Sandhya Sriram.\nFounded in August last year, Singapore-based Shiok Meats is the first\xa0cell-based\xa0meat company in Southeast Asia. It is the brainchild of two stem cell biologists: Dr Sriram, 33 and Dr Ling, 31.\nWhile cell-based meat companies are not new, with\xa0Memphis Meats operating since 2015,\xa0most are based in the United States.\nRather than focusing on beef, chicken and pork, Shiok Meats wants to create shrimp, crab and lobster meat for the Asian market.\n“(In Asia), we eat a lot of seafood, and not many companies were doing seafood,” she said. “And (personally), Ka Yi and I were very fascinated about saving the ocean as individuals.”\nAs one of the first companies growing shrimp meat, Shiok Meats had to do everything from scratch.\n“There is no academic research out there so even figuring out which part of the animal is a good source for stem cells (was difficult),""\xa0she said.\nAnd buying shrimp became a problem, as the company had to find shrimp farms that did not use antibiotics or hormones.\n“Currently the way shrimps are being grown in farms, they are being grown in dirty water and being injected with antibiotics and hormones to keep them clean and make them bigger. We had to find very specific shrimp farms for clean shrimp to source our stem cells,” said Dr Sriram.\nCell-based meats have fewer toxins and are less taxing on the earth’s resources, according to Dr Sriram.\n“The vision of the company is to completely replace farmed shrimp and wild-caught shrimp. (We want to have) Shiok Shrimp in supermarkets, hawker centres, restaurants, everything,” she said.\nFor the year ahead, they plan to lower the cost of production by 100 times.\nStem cells have to be placed in a nutrient mix for the cells to grow into meat, but this solution is now too costly for mass production.\nThis is why creating eight dumplings cost the company about S$5,000.\n“If we can hit that magic potion, the price (of the eight dumplings) will come from S$5,000 to S$50,” she said.\nShe estimates that it would take them at least five years to reach the mass market, but Shiok Meats is in talks with three premium restaurants to use their shrimp by the end of next year.\nMany investors have already expressed their interest in Shiok Meats, although most of them are based\xa0outside Asia.\n“We raised a little more than half a million in two and a half months of starting the company, (but) most of it was money from the US,""\xa0said Dr Sriram.\nFRANKEN MEAT?\nLab-grown meat has had a rocky start with consumers in other countries, with some media outlets labelling it ""Franken meat"".\nWill food-obsessed Singaporeans accept it?\nAssistant Professor Charlene Chen\xa0of the Division of Marketing and International Business at NTU’s Nanyang Business School, believes that there is a future for cell-based meat in Singapore.\n“Consumers often buy products to express their values and identities, and buying cell-based meat is a way to express one’s concern for animal welfare (and) the environment in general,” she said.\nAssistant Professor Leonard Lee, of the Department of Marketing at NUS Business School was less enthusiastic.\n“Singaporeans may be receptive toward such products that potentially serve broader societal needs,” he said, “(but) consumers in Singapore may also be more risk-averse particularly when it pertains to their health and safety.”\nDr Sriram believes that the mixed reception towards cell-based meat stems from a generational divide, citing surveys that she has done with more than\xa0700 members of the public.\n“The Millennial generation are the ones who are more open and receptive because they truly care about the environment and sustainability, and they’re willing to try newer things,” she said. “I think that it’s the older generation that might find it hard to accept.”\nMembers of the public that CNA spoke to were generally open to trying cell-based meat.\nNational University of Singapore student, 24-year-old Cheong Yinn Shan said:\xa0""I would definitely be keen to try this. The meat industry contributes a lot of greenhouse gases and has a high water footprint, so I will support any innovations to reduce our society’s reliance on factory-farmed meat.”\nMs Jelena Lim, a 23-year-old Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy student, expressed reservations.\n“I would eat it because I’m curious, but the price has to be comparable to traditional meat, it has to taste good, and there are no ethical dilemmas from using stem cells,” she said.\nRetiree Robert Tan, 60, had similar doubts.\xa0\n“The (long-term effects of cell-based meat) may never be known in our generation, as it may be 50 years down the road. My take is that if FDA (US Food and Drug Administration) and medical authorities say\xa0that it is okay, we just follow,” he said.\n', 'related_topics': ['     food ']}"

He is fuelled by the constant goal to create “dishes that are a bit more unique"" and with ""a creative twist”.\nHashida is\xa0so passionate about making his own food that he is producing his own caviar. To do so, he has\xa0partnered with Hal Caviar, a sturgeon breeder in Hamamatsu, Japan.\nHal Caviar\xa0general manager Hidenori Nakamura explained that the soft water in Hamamatsu allows them to successfully breed sturgeon and produce quality caviar. In fact, the caviar produced here is\xa0set to rival those from Russia and Iran.\nJust as unexpected was Hashida\'s discovery of how sturgeon itself is a tasty meat. Sturgeon, he said, has a surprisingly complex and beautiful flavour, which explains why he couldn’t wait to share it with his customers in Singapore.\nAt his restaurant Hashida, the chef serves up a playful balance of flavour combinations, including sturgeon sashimi with caviar; a sturgeon broth made from boiling its bones with lemongrass, and\xa0topped with steamed sturgeon meat rolled in hotate (scallop); and sturgeon sashimi with uni sauce, which is composed of mascarpone cheese mixed with sea urchin.\nIt all connects with Hashida\'s culinary philosophy of combining Japanese tradition with creative expression.\nYes, he wants to “do something different”, but he\'s also designed his restaurant with an old-school Japanese aesthetic, diligently studies the works of past master chefs, and keeps his\xa0family heritage alive\xa0by serving his father’s signature otoro or fatty tuna.\nAs Nakamura describes, Chef Hashida ""not only keeps\xa0Japanese traditions –\xa0he also creates new opportunities.”\nAdapted from the series Remarkable Living.

      Tech for urban farming among R&amp;D focus as Singapore looks to beef up food security
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: As part of his job, Liew Woei Chang keeps a close eye on hundreds of tilapia fish daily.\xa0\nBut the 39-year-old does not work in the fish trade. In fact, the tilapia that he monitors possess quite an atypical trait.\nA freshwater fish, tilapias tend to grow slower or face high mortality rates when reared in sea water. Together with four other researchers, Dr Liew, a research investigator at the Temasek Life Sciences Laboratory (TLL), has been looking at how to change that.\nEight years since the research programme started, the team has “almost achieved” that.\n“Tilapia is one of the most important aquaculture species, being the second most-farmed fish in the world. Traditionally, tilapia have been grown in Singapore and around the region but they do not take to sea water well, so the survivability and growth rates here have not been high,” Dr Liew told Channel NewsAsia during a visit to his lab earlier this week.\nThrough the use of technology that can accurately identify fish with desired traits and select them for its selective breeding programme, TLL researchers have been able to breed good-quality and salt-tolerant tilapia, now in the fifth generation, without any genetic modification.\n“We will do mass cross-breeding for each batch of fish and after about 3 months, do a size selection where we will pick out those that have grown the fastest. We will find out the parents of these superior fish and use them to breed more fish. Their offspring will then be used for the next batch,” said Dr Liew who has been involved in the tilapia selection project since 2014.\n“We have been hoping to achieve high-yield, fast-growth tilapia that can survive in sea water. I think we have almost achieved that.”\nIn another TLL laboratory nearby, Dr Urano Daisuke is hoping to grow vegetables that are climate-proof and have improved agronomical traits and nutritional values.\nWhile an indoor setting allows researchers to come up with optimal conditions, it brings about a different set of challenges.\n“Unlike outdoor farms with problems like the weather or pathogens, we don’t have to consider these threats in indoor farms. But plants here need to grow at a high-density setting with low-light intensity.”\nThe latter stems from cost issues faced by many indoor farms. “Lighting makes up the biggest cost for the business of indoor farming. In Japan, for example, advanced indoor farms spend about 70 to 80 per cent of their costs on LED lights and the remaining on temperature control,” elaborated Dr Urano, who is the principal investigator for TLL’s research on vegetables.\nUnder low light conditions, plants tend to start growing longer stalks to help them fight for light. This usually results in smaller leaves.\xa0\n“But the plants we want is even under low light, they can still make big leaves which is what people eat … If the plants can grow nicely at low-light intensity, then we can reduce cost,” added Dr Urano.\n“The plants for indoor farming will have to be different so we need to modify some traits and breed new vegetables that have these unique traits.”\nSINGAPORE RAMPS UP AGRI-FOOD R&D BUDGET\nSuch research and development (R&D) projects are what Singapore is looking to pump in more money as it beefs up its agriculture and food production sector.\nIn line with the newly announced target to produce 30 per cent of the nation’s nutritional needs by 2030, the Government will invest S$144 million from its Research, Innovation and Enterprise 2020 (RIE2020) plan to ramp up R&D in the agri-food industry.\nThe National Research Foundation (NRF), in a press release on Wednesday (Mar 27), said factors like climate change, rising sea levels and temperatures are risks to world food production. Given Singapore’s space and resource constraints, the country is vulnerable to these global trends that impact food supply and safety.\nCiting how the country has previously tapped on science and technology to tackle its water constraints, it needs to do the same for its food challenges.\nThe new funds will go to R&D efforts in three areas, namely sustainable urban food production with focus on tropical aquaculture and urban agriculture, development of “future foods” in the form of alternative proteins, as well as building new food safety standards and local capabilities to drive innovation in food production and manufacturing.\xa0\n“With the investments we are putting in place, it will help to raise productivity of some of the locally produced food sources,"" National Development\xa0Minister Lawrence Wong said at a press conference held after the 11th Research, Innovation and Enterprise Council (RIEC) meeting on Wednesday.\n“We can also invest in the strengths we have in biotechnology and advanced manufacturing (to) help us look at new food sources emerging now.\n""This will also help us improve our understanding in how these food sources are evolving, strengthen our capabilities in regulating food and ensuring food safety for the future,"" he added.\nTo complement this, two Centres of Innovation focusing on aquaculture and energy will be set up in Temasek Polytechnic and the Nanyang Technological University by June and April, respectively.\nUSING TECH TO PRODUCE MORE\nTLL’s chief executive Peter Chia welcomes the increasing attention on the local agri-tech sector. More than just funds, he said he is excited about the growing awareness that has been created about the industry.\n“Rather than just approaching it from a biology point of view, which gives you only one side of the equation, we can now bring together people from multiple backgrounds, agencies to meet the ’30 by 30’ goal in a much more considered way.”\nSince founded in 2002, TLL has focused primarily on understanding the cellular mechanisms underpinning the development and physiology of plants, fungi and animals. Its selective breeding programme on fish genetics, for one, has successfully yielded a premium breed of sea bass that is less susceptible to disease and can be bred in 30 per cent less time.\nIts ongoing research on salt-tolerant tilapia and the climate-proofing of vegetables are other ways it hopes technology can help to bolster Singapore’s food security.\n“As aquaculture becomes more knowledge-intensive, the idea is for us to contribute with technology and knowledge to improve productivity overall,” said Mr Chia.\n“To produce more with less, and in a lower risk manner so that in general, we will have better-quality food and more affordable food, which is the definition of food security.”\nFor the tilapia selection project, outdoor trials will be the next step to take and researchers are currently looking to supply fingerlings to farmers in Singapore for a start.\n“We have transformed the tilapia to be able to grow in sea water so what’s next is to have farmers to be aware of this and get them to take our fish for trials in the real environment,” said Dr Liew.\n', 'related_topics': ['     technology ', '     food ']}"

      Turning ethical farming into an immersive travel experience just outside Sydney
  </h1>, 'text': 'In the age of mass-produced meat sold in soulless hypermarkets, a family-run farm continues to uphold its legacy of producing ethically farmed meat in the rolling hills of Australia’s Southern Highlands.\nIn 1972, Joe Mauger established the first butchery in Burrawang, a village about an-hour-and-a-half drive south of Sydney, selling mainly beef and lamb from animals reared on his farm.\nToday, his son, 60-year-old John, who took over the Maugers Meats business at the age of 18 when his father passed away, continues to supply top quality grass-fed and free-range beef and lamb to the community and restaurants in the region.\nBesides the family farm located in the village of Robertson, the Maugers also own and run two butcheries in Burrawang and Moss Vale, as well as Laurel View Farmstay, which is the original 1950s farmhouse that John grew up in, and is now mainly overseen by his wife Vicki, 60, who makes sure guests are well fed with delicious cakes.\nJohn’s children, Leah, 36,\xa0Mat, 34,\xa0and Nicole, 31, help out in the business. Mat takes charge of the butcheries and Leah handles marketing and administration, while John manages the day-to-day farm operations. Nicole is currently on maternity leave.\nIn 2017, the Maugers started the Paddock To Plate tour with culinary tour specialist Nosh Trekker to give visitors an insight into the practices of a sustainable meat farm, including rearing and butchering techniques that have been used over three generations; what is grain and lot feeding, and why they are beneficial; as well as how the methods used by John’s father have been proven to yield quality meat.\nAccording to Suzannah Cowley, a Nosh Trekker marketing representative who worked with the Maugers on the tour details, participants can choose to stay in the neighbouring villages of either Burrawang or Bowral, and get private transfers to the farm the next day.\nShe shared:\xa0“From the moment they arrive at the farm, it is an immersive experience from hearing about the rich family story and observing how the cattle and sheep are reared, to witnessing their amazing knife skills in breaking down the carcass at the butcher shop and tasting the meat at nearby cafe, The Burrawang General Store”.\nFor those curious to know what exactly constitutes a 100 per cent grass-fed or free-range animal, Mauger says that the tour will “give an honest and open view of farming practices where I cut through the glossy advertising and false claims”.\nHe shares how his animals graze fully on grass or hay and silage (grass that have been cut and baled for later use, usually during the winter months) and are free to roam paddocks in a natural environment with dams, springs and trees to keep them happy and stress-free.\n“I choose not to administer antibiotics or hormones to my animals, and I personally handle all of them in a gentle and calm manner,” said Mauger. “I do not use electrical stimulators, savage dogs or rough treatment. Stress is one of the most significant causes of tough meat as it causes the muscles to tense, tighten and shorten.”\nThe three-hour Paddock To Plate tour can be taken on its own, or included as part of a longer itinerary such as Noshtrekker’s Wildes Meadow and Highlands Gateway tours that explore wineries and the scenic countryside, with personalised dinners by well-known local chefs passionate about highlighting Highlands produce, such as Thomas Pirker, executive chef at fine dining restaurant Katers, and Teena Crooks, a private dining chef who used to be the executive chef of Vault Dining Room in\xa0heritage-filled The Old Bank Hotel.\nCowley highly recommends Katers at Peppers Manor House, which is a 30-minute drive away from the Maugers’ farm. It offers outstanding tasting menus of the freshest seasonal produce, including its own homegrown herbs and vegetables,\xa0in a magnificent country estate setting. The restaurant is an Australian Good Food Guide Chef Hat Award winner, and its menus list local producers such as Maugers Meats’ beef and lamb, so you know where your food comes from.\nAnother local favourite: The Burrawang Village Hotel pub, housed in a historic building located opposite the Maugers’ butchery, which supplies the meat used in hearty pub classics such as slow braised lamb shoulders, rump steak, and beef burger patties, all served in a casual convivial atmosphere.\nFor those who appreciate a community that supports each other in ethical food practices and spotlighting local ingredients, a trip to the Southern Highlands will be definitely be one worth sampling and savouring.\n', 'related_topics': ['     food ', '     Travel ', '     Australia ', '     tour ', '     Luxury Destinations ', '     Activities ', '     Places & Attractions ']}"

      A serving of luxury Thai condo or immersive theatre to go with your main course
  </h1>, 'text': 'I looked about apprehensively at the strange faces around me. It was Valentine’s Day at the Telok Ayer Arts Club, where the final installation of 11, an experiential performance piece by Dawn Ng, was about to take place. I was one of 22 participants that would be paired up to read out 11 different scripts while moving through 11 confessional booths, musical chair-style.\nI had previously lunched at the space when it first opened last August and thought of it as another CBD diner, only differentiated by arts-related events. That night, the familiar feeling was turned on its head. The dining area had been transformed to accommodate the circular arrangement of the confessional booths, leaving only a holding area of several seats near the bar where everyone was milling about pre-event.\nEven before taking on 11 different personas, I was already freaking out in my own introverted one.\nMy fears turned out unfounded. By the second script, my booth partner and I were giggling so much that we could barely finish our lines. By the end of the experience, everyone was discussing the experience with newfound friends over drinks and bar snacks.\nA curious camaraderie had somehow sprouted out of the 90 minutes of us fleshing out fictional lives, and new perspectives were being bandied about between the comforting clink of glasses and bites of chilli crab mantou, spam chips and chicken wings with homemade smoked honey garlic sauce.\nAt the newly opened Siri House at Dempsey, a myriad retail temptations – a swanky condo sales gallery and quirky lifestyle accessories from street cred t-shirts to sculptural home decor items – already assault your senses before you lay eyes on the delicious modern Asian plates and bespoke cocktails at JAM.\nJAM is run by Park Bench Deli co-owner, Ming Tan, Jeremy Cheok (previously of New Ubin Seafood Garang Grill), and Sunday Punch’s Mark Tay and Yap Hwee Jen. Need more food for thought? Pop into the art gallery, which currently houses Thai artist Gongkan’s exhibition Another Dimension.\nMulti-concept venues incorporating lifestyle, arts and food such as Siri House and Telok Ayer Arts Club have been opening in succession in Singapore for the last five years, reflecting a global retail-dining trend that seeks to attract a more discerning crowd.\nSiri House is Thai luxury property developer Sansiri’s maiden foray into the multi-concept lifestyle space in Singapore. Its second outlet will open this month on home ground in Bangkok.\nIts chief global branding officer Mai Timblick says that Siri House represents the brand’s philosophy to go beyond constructing buildings to shape and contribute to a lifestyle that bring together design, the arts, Thai culture and hospitality. Prior to its opening in Singapore, the brand had already been infusing lifestyle events such as a flea market festival and an exhibition showcase on Spanish contemporary artist Miquel Barcelo in its residential projects.\nTimblick said, “Siri House represents this Sansiri manner of living, where good food, communities and culture all come together in one space. Food is always the best way to reach people.”\nPrior to TAAC, The Supermarket Company had opened multi-use restaurant space SPRMRKT with locations at STPI at Robertson Quay and Cluny Court.\n“When SPRMRKT was first introduced in 2012, it was the group’s first cultural-culinary concept and it made the arts less intimidating and more accessible by combining it with food and retail in a single, multifaceted experience,” explained TAAC’s arts manager Anmari Van Nieuwenhove.\n“When SPRMRKT moved out of the McCallum Street premises into Cluny Court, and coupled with an observed growing appetite for more after-work options in the CBD, Telok Ayer Arts Club is our response to create a space that re-envisions the idea of the Singaporean community centre while meeting the desire for culture and nightlife not just for the CBD, but the F&B industry as a whole.”\nUnlisted Collection restaurateur and hotelier Loh Lik Peng believes that this multi-concept trend will persist and get even better, and cites the example of Cafe Kitsune, the coffee-design-fashion space by Parisian music and fashion label Maison Kitsune located in Seoul, Tokyo and Paris, as an attractive concept that draws sophisticated shoppers.\nHe added, “The retail scene is changing so rapidly that it’s now all about multi-modal offerings. Retail is not compelling enough on its own. Food and drink, if done well, is convivial and social, and is a good way to draw a different crowd to your venue.""\n', 'related_topics': ['     food ', '     gastronomy ', '     art ', '     Luxury Destinations ']}"

      Road test an oven, then tuck into Modern European cuisine at V Dining
  </h1>, 'text': 'When Swiss premium home appliance maker V-ZUG\xa0launched its first showroom in Singapore late last year, it did so with a splash. Dubbed Zugorama\xa0and located\xa0on the third level of Scotts Square, it overlooks the hustle and bustle of Orchard Road. Inside, customers can witness the brand’s innovative household appliances for the kitchen and wardrobe in an elegant home-inspired setting.\nIn true Swiss-perfection form, V-ZUG has one-upped its showroom concept by introducing V Dining, a Modern European fine dining restaurant, where the entire\xa0menu is prepared using the brand’s professional-level kitchen appliances. This brainchild of CEO Alberto Bertoz\xa0was conceptualised and designed with\xa0input from chef Ryan Clift, V-ZUG\'s global ambassador and V Dining\'s culinary director.\nV Dining’s discreet entrance – to the side of Zugorama – is discerned through its logo:\xa0Two\xa0inverted cherries with their stems\xa0forming the letter “V”. Cherries are a well-known produce of Zug, the Swiss town from where V-ZUG originates. A narrow walkway flanked by\xa0the\xa0colourful, still-life photography series In Relation & Motion\xa0by internationally-acclaimed photographer, Ron Greve, leads guests into the restaurant’s 35-seater dining hall.\nThanks to floor-to-ceiling glass windows, the restaurant is bathed in natural light during the day and offers one of the best panoramic views of Scotts Road. A long countertop hugs the swanky kitchen, letting diners grab\xa0front-row\xa0seats to the culinary spectacle that involves using\xa0V-ZUG appliances\xa0to create innovative and tasty dishes.\nFans of Clift’s progressive cooking at Tippling Club will be pleased to find some familiarity in the culinary direction at V Dining. The\xa0lunch menu kicks off with a snack of laksa mousse topped with fried taupok, dehydrated laksa leaves, and coconut cream all served in a coconut bowl\xa0–\xa0a deconstructed rendition of the local favourite laksa.\nThe series of moreish amuse bouche follows with Air Baguette, manchego cheese puff topped with cheese jelly and truffle gel; and Pork Crackling, rendered in a mini cone and stuffed with diced apple and vinegar.\nNaturally, the food highlights\xa0the capabilities of V-ZUG appliances. Head chef Lee Jing Peng, who’s worked under Clift for many years, presides over the kitchen.\xa0\nHe noted: “We planned the menu, taking into account, the functions of the V-ZUG ovens. For example, one of the functions of the Combi-Steam XSL is the Vacuisine, which is similar to a sous-vide bath circulator in commercial kitchens; we use this to cook our guinea fowl and pigeon.\xa0\n""Our signature dish of hamachi collar uses the grilled-forced convection function. We also keep some of our garnishes in V-ZUG’s plate warmer, which has different temperature functions,” said Lee.\nClift’s love of playing with textures in his food is evident in dishes like the comforting Mrs Potter Leek & Potato Soup, topped with crispy kale and nori, and made especially flavourful with confit potato; and the rich and generously portioned Prawn Bisque Risotto with rouille, crispy parmesan and\xa0garlic bread.\nThe precision of V-ZUG’s Combi-Steamers, when it comes to humidity, temperature, and steam generation control, shows itself in the perfect doneness of the\xa0Poached Chicken served with fermented spinach, mushroom and roast jus, and the tender Roast Lamb Shoulder a la Francaise.\nV Dining clearly stands on its own as a restaurant but it is also effective as an extended concept of the V-ZUG brand. As Jonas Honegger, Head of Development, Asia Pacific V-ZUG shared:\xa0“V Dining in Singapore is the first restaurant for V-ZUG. In other regions, we cooperate with chefs in establishing, for example, a V-ZUG VIP lounge (in Beijing), or using a special food truck in Switzerland with Andreas Caminada (three Michelin stars)\xa0and Tanja Grandits (two Michelin stars).\n“But for a full restaurant set-up, this is the first one in the world. We chose to debut in Singapore due to its diverse culinary scene and appreciation for good food, but also due to the very good cooperation with our local brand ambassador chef Ryan Clift. There will be other cities to follow soon.”\nLunch is priced at S$48++ (two-course), S$60++ (three-course), and S$90++ (five-course). For dinner, V\xa0Dining offers a six-course menu at S$130++ and a 10-course menu at S$180++. A wine pairing option is also available.\n', 'related_topics': ['     food ', '     gastronomy ', '     Singapore ', '     Orchard Road ', '     Fine dining ', '     Restaurants ']}"

      Unique Food Trails: Loh Lik Peng recommends rustic adventures in Italy
  </h1>, 'text': 'Think ""ski holiday""\xa0and the food images usually conjured up are\xa0those of carb-laden plates and hearty stews.\n\nBut for hotelier and restaurateur Loh Lik Peng, the gastronomic highlight of a recent ski holiday with his family in\xa0the Dolomites of northern Italy\xa0was, rather surprisingly,\xa0seafood.\n\nThe dishes served at the humble family-run Rifugio Emilio Comici (""rifugio""\xa0means “refuge"" or ""shelter"" in\xa0Italian) in Val Gardena were so delicious that Loh and his family – wife Min Lee and kids Conor, seven, and Cassidy, three – returned for another two meals during their stay.\n\n\nA post shared by Loh Lik Peng (@pengloh)\n“Live lobsters, scallops, oysters, everything was really good!,"" gushed Loh. ""They had some of the best monkfish I’ve ever had. I was amazed to find it in the mountains. They told me that produce was all local and from the nearby Venice coastline.”\n\n\n\nA post shared by Loh Lik Peng (@pengloh)\nFEASTING (AND COOKING) IN VAL GARDENA\nThe Lohs tried seafood salads with generous portions of octopus, prawns and lobsters, and tasty pastas cooked with lobster and roasted porcini mushrooms. The fresh and lightly-seasoned monkfish fillets were, in Loh’s opinion, cooked to perfection, while the lemon sole, pan-fried in butter and served bone-in, was also excellent.\n\n\n“It was simple preparation but clearly done by a very skilled kitchen team,” Loh told CNA Luxury.\nReservations are recommended or be prepared to wait very patiently for a table.\n\nVal Gardena is a valley located in the Dolomites, a stunning UNESCO World Heritage mountain range in the northern Italian Alps. It has three villages – Ortisei, Santa Cristina and Selva Val Gardena – and besides Italian and German, the inhabitants also speak Ladin, a language older than Italian.\n\n\nCulinary gems like Emilio Comici were gleaned from locals, namely the ski instructors. “It is apparently quite a legend among them,” said Loh. “Other food recommendations were from Irish friends who regularly ski here. The rest is a mixture of research and taking a chance on a place that looks decent.”\nAnother recommendation: Rifugio Fodom, where, after a morning of skiing, Loh ejoyed a mammoth slab of medium sirloin – “It must have been about 400 grams!” – and a regional speciality of sausage patty, mixed mushroom, polenta, and a slice of grilled local hard cheese.\n\n\nA post shared by Loh Lik Peng (@pengloh)\nAs the Lohs usually travel with their young children, they prefer apartments with kitchen facilities and nearby supermarkets. On this trip, the produce at their local supermarket became the inspiration for home-cooked meals as dad discovered very reasonably priced rabbit meat, cheeses and Parma ham.\n\n\n“It was just €15 to €20 (S$23 to S$30) per meal to feed a family of four heartily!” said Loh, who whipped up\xa0a slow-cooked rabbit casserole with white sauce made from €10 wine. Leftovers were turned into a delicious fettucine dish the next day.\n\n\nA post shared by Loh Lik Peng (@pengloh)\nHe also made a slow-cooked beef ragu, sneaking in plenty of vegetables such as carrots, celery and courgette for the kids, as well as a huge pot of ossobuco cooked in a red wine and tomato stew with heaps of garlic, onion, celery and carrots.\n\n\n\nA post shared by Loh Lik Peng (@pengloh)\n\n\nA post shared by Loh Lik Peng (@pengloh)\n\'SERIOUSLY TASTY\'\xa0VERONA\nVerona was another delightful place for Loh, where there were so many good restaurants to try that he did not attempt to cook at all. One was Osteria Casa Vino, teeming\xa0with locals,\xa0and home to the best pasta Loh ate on the trip: Fresh tagliolini tossed with cuttlefish, prawn and aromatic herbed crispy breadcrumbs.\n\n\n\nA post shared by Loh Lik Peng (@pengloh)\nAt Michelin Plate Trattoria I Masenini, a cosy traditional trattoria near the Castelvecchio castle, he had a local speciality, a “very delicious” bigoli pasta with sardines and crispy breadcrumbs followed by crispy suckling pig. Lee had her favourite tartare and a lamb shank, which Loh described as “seriously tasty”.\n\n\nA post shared by Loh Lik Peng (@pengloh)\nWhen it comes to meal choices, Loh says that his wife usually leaves the decision to him. “For her, eating is more of a function, but for me it is a different thing,” said Loh. “She is quite happy to indulge me although in some ways, she’s the more adventurous one as she eats virtually everything. She even ate sea worms in Korea, which I don’t even want to try!”\n\n\n\nA post shared by Loh Lik Peng (@pengloh)\nThe couple had a date night in Verona at one-Michelin star Ristorante Il Desco, a 30-year-old legend on the Verona dining scene, said Loh, who loved the 14th-century dining room and the excellent meal service. “The tasting menu was creative with great produce and clever touches. Scampi tempura and creamy sweet bread were among my favourite dishes.”\n\nAs papa and mama had their food thrills, travel troopers Conor and Cassidy were happy to tuck into their favourite pizzas and carbonara pasta at every meal.\nFor Loh, exploring the unknown is part of the fun when unearthing great eats.\n“It does not have to be fine dining because I often travel with the kiddos, but it needs to be tasty and nutritious,"" he said. ""I think it’s just making the effort to find good eating places wherever you go.""\n\n\n', 'related_topics': ['     food ', '     Italy ', '     Fine dining ', '     Places & Attractions ', '     Activities ', '     Restaurants ']}"

  </h1>, 'text': 'PARIS:\xa0From a container wafts the sweetly pungent odour of coffee grounds which, far from being discarded as waste, are being lucratively recycled to produce oyster mushrooms.\nGrounds, which Parisian brasseries throw out daily by the tonne, are perfect for the job, and a snapshot of a fast-growing urban agricultural trend.\nThe mulch of grounds is mixed with cardboard and wood chips and shoved into lengths of plastic with pieces of mushroom culture.\nThey are then hung vertically in a dark space and left to incubate for a fortnight.\n""We are reproducing undergrowth subsoil conditions. The temperature and humidity are comparable,"" explains Arnaud Ulrich, co-founder of UpCycle-La boite à champignons (mushroom box), based in the Paris suburb of Saint-Nom-la-Breteche.\nNestled away from the light, the spores of mushroom mycelium fungus - a key food source for many soil invertebrates and which can also help to clean polluted soil - rapidly spread as they would beneath the roots of a tree.\nAfter incubation, the bags containing the grounds and spores, by now completely white, are transferred to a different room for ""fructification"".\nCUE THE LIGHTS\nThere, the lights are switched on and humidity reduced. Cuts are made in the bags, allowing the mushrooms to emerge.\n""The mushrooms are \'stressed\' -\xa0which makes them want to reproduce and free up their spores, leave the bags,"" says Ulrich. ""It simply remains to harvest them.""\nUlrich says urban agriculture is first and foremost about recycling organic waste from cities as a means of expanding the move towards a regenerative, \'circular economy\' making more judicious use of finite resources.\n""Thirty percent of urban waste is useful biowaste and today, only five percent of this organic matter is recycled,"" he notes.\n""We are just doing what they did in the 19th Century, but with modern methods,"" he said.\nAt that time, ""Paris mushrooms"" were also born from the idea of recycling organic matter.\nMarket gardeners cultivated their produce in quarries on the perimeter of the capital making use of the droppings of the thousands of horses who helped to deliver vegetables to the market at Les Halles in central Paris.\nSMELL THAT COFFEE AGAIN\nToday, some 20 tonnes of coffee grounds are collected each month in and around Paris, the bulk from large firms\' restaurants in the west of the city. From that can be produced around two tonnes of oyster mushrooms.\nAt 15 euros (US$17) per kilo that equates to a 30,000 euro \'harvest\' and a campaign is under way to encourage more Parisian cafes to get in on the act.\n""It\'s a virtuous undertaking -\xa0we are producing between 20 and 30 kilos of grounds a week,"" says Romain Vidal, 30 and the owner of Le Sully brasserie in Paris and a pioneer of the recycling technique.\n""And our chef puts the oyster mushrooms on the menu for the brasserie\'s customers,"" he adds.\nThe chef concurs, saying he is ""delighted,"" describing the mushrooms as thick and juicy.\nAfter every expresso, every cappuccino, Le Sully\'s waiters bag the used grounds which a delivery biker from the coffee company whisks away so further use can be made of them.\nParis\'s deep-rooted cafe culture means there is no shortage of the stuff -\xa0the city annually produces around 600,000 tonnes of grounds, according to UpCycle, which is helping manage similar projects in several other French towns.\nAfter harvesting, the already recycled grounds embark upon their third lifespan, returning to the ground as compost - or \'champost\', a play on words with champignon, French for mushroom - mixed in with mushroom strands and wood cellulose.\nWith their system up and running, Ulrich and co are branching out by installing ""Rocket"" compost machines in the heart of Paris\' La Defense business centre.\nThe machines swallow up organic waste from restaurants such as peelings and leftover food waste, be it meat or fish, as well as grass cuttings.\nThe resulting scrunched up waste produces compost in record time... which in turn will be utilised to spawn more Parisian mushrooms from September.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Paris ', '     food ']}"

      From fighting diabetes to food waste, start-ups cook up new ideas for food
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Affecting more than 420 million people globally, diabetes has been described as one of the world’s fastest growing chronic diseases and for Alan Phua, it is one that he lost both his grandmothers to.\nSo when Verleen Goh, his business partner and a trained food scientist, suggested developing a product that’s not only diabetes-friendly but can also help with prevention, he agreed.\nThe product they envisioned will make starchy white rice “healthier” by lowering its glycemic index (GI), which is a measure of how a carbohydrate-containing food raises blood glucose level. White rice, a staple of meals here in Singapore and the rest of Asia, has a high GI value that is deemed unhealthy for diabetics or those trying to keep their blood sugar at a healthy level.\nAfter three years of research and development, the founders of Alchemy Foodtech have turned that idea into reality.\nTheir plant-based ingredient blend, shaped like rice grains, can be added into a regular sack of white rice to lower the GI content to that of brown rice. In its powder form, it can also be added to other refined carbohydrate staples, like bread and noodles, without comprising the taste, colour and texture.\nFor this product, Mr Phua and Ms Goh won the top prize at a start-up competition organised by the Enterprise Singapore last year.\n“People can continue consuming their favourite carbohydrate staples but not have dangerous spikes in blood glucose levels after that.”\nCiting statistics from the World Health Organisation on how more than 90 per cent of patients suffer from Type 2 diabetes – the type that is not genetic and largely preventable by changing lifestyle habits – Mr Phua added that the application of technology to food can play a key role in combating diabetes.\n“We want to fight the disease with innovation,” he said.\nIt is a similar motivation for the makers of Callery’s – a local ice cream brand that prides itself for tasting “as good as the real deal” despite cutting calories and sugar levels by about two-thirds.\n“I’ve seen how hard it is to find good-tasting food that is safe for diabetics,” said Mr Ow Yau Png, co-founder of Hoow Foods, while referring to the frustration some of his family members have had.\xa0\n“It is even harder if you are a sweet tooth and it’s sad to see your loved ones being deprived of things they have always enjoyed. But it doesn’t have to be this way and that is the market gap we want to fill.”\nFor one and a half years, the team experimented with the replacement of sugar and fats with novel ingredients approved by the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA). This includes erythritol, a zero-calorie natural sweetener found in fruits and vegetables.\nThe research and development process took longer than expected as it was difficult to source for these ingredients and not compromise on taste.\nBut its efforts paid off as almost 4,000 tubs of the guilt-free ice cream range have been sold since its launch four months ago, said Mr Ow.\n“For a brand that’s new to the market, we think this is a good number and it shows how consumers crave for a low-sugar, low-calorie product that has a taste they are used to.”\nMoving forward, the home-grown start-up is looking to come up with more ice cream flavours and reformulate other indulgent food. Using the proprietary tech platform that it has already built up, it believes it can do so in a faster and cheaper manner.\nBREWING APPETITE\nAlchemy Foodtech and Hoow Foods make up a new breed of start-ups in Singapore’s food tech industry, which unlike the delivery start-ups that have long dominated the local scene, focus on bringing innovation to food on the table.\nThis mirrors a trend that has been brewing in other markets, such as the United States and Israel, with the rise of start-ups like US plant-based meat maker Impossible Foods, noted Sirius Venture Capital’s founder and managing director Eugene Wong.\n“The easiest pain point to solve was delivery and that took off. Those in the industry are now looking at other areas that hold similar disruption potential, and that’s food itself given the growing awareness about the issues of obesity and illnesses, environment degradation and sustainability.\n“Now that there’s smarter tech like big data and artificial intelligence, can there be a better way to eat?”\nIn Singapore, apart from making healthier or cleaner food, some entrepreneurs here have also set their sights on tackling the problem of food wastage.\nSinFooTech, for instance, has come up with a way to turn soy whey – excess water generated from the production of tofu which is often discarded – into an alcoholic beverage.\nTouted as a first in the world, the unexpected creation came about when co-founder Chua Jian Yong noticed large amounts of soy whey being discarded by tofu makers around the world. For a small factory in Singapore, SinFooTech estimates that nearly 3 tonnes of the by-product is thrown away on a daily basis.\nGiven that soy whey contains high levels of calcium and soya nutrients, the PhD student from the National University of Singapore’s (NUS) food science and technology department thought it was a waste and began mulling how the liquid can be “upcycled”.\nThe end result is Sachi – a light yellow-coloured beverage with an alcohol content of seven per cent and a tinge of fruity flavour. SinFooTech, which decided to spin off from NUS last year, is applying for relevant licenses so that it can conduct experiments at bigger volumes, and hopefully launch the product by the end of the year.\nIt is also looking to develop other soy whey-based beverages now that its proprietary fermentation technology has “upcycled the by-product into a base ingredient” and yields zero waste, said co-founder Jonathan Ng. “If we use 10 litres of soy whey, we can create 10 litres of Sachi.”\nWith that, it believes that its technology can help to tackle the issue of wastage during food production.\n“We want to focus on extracting value from these food processing by-products that are usually discarded,” said Mr Ng. “In doing so, we can produce more from the same resources, reduce environmental footprint and in the longer run, improve food security.”\nVCS SAY BON APPETIT, BUT WILL CONSUMERS BITE?\nWith more start-ups jumping on the food tech bandwagon, the industry is seeing “encouraging” growth signs.\n“I think this growth spurt is only starting. We are only seeing local start-ups for now but what can happen in the next few years is the entry of foreign entrepreneurs. If we can see that, the growth in the ecosystem and exchange of ideas can help to produce real game-changing innovation.” said Mr Wong from Sirius Venture Capital.\nTemasek-backed Impossible Foods announced on Wednesday (Jan 9) that it is eyeing global expansion, with plans to launch its new recipe here within several months.\nMr Wong added that private investors are also starting to take notice of Singapore.\xa0\n“One of the challenges thus far has been the lack of capital but I think this will change,” he told Channel NewsAsia, noting that a couple of overseas investors are looking to set up offices here.\nCombined together with funds from the public sector, Mr Wong reckons that the amount of investments into the local food tech scene could grow by “10 times over the next two to three years”.\nStart-ups are also receiving training and support from home-grown businesses. SinFooTech, for one, is among the six start-ups that have joined Innovate360 – Singapore’s first food incubator set up by sugar manufacturing and trading firm Cheng Yew Heng Candy Factory.\nFor Alchemy Foodtech, it received a “major confidence boost” last September when it secured a seven-digit investment in a pre-series A round led by Heritas Capital Management and Seeds Capital, the investment arm of Enterprise Singapore.\n“The problem we had all along was to convince people that food tech was a thing, and that our product is considered deep tech,” recalled Ms Goh. “But with the rise of food tech, we do see more funds taking an interest in start-ups like us.”\nThe investment will allow Alchemy Foodtech to finally have its own lab and equipment. Prior to this, it was working out of Ms Goh’s alma mater, NUS, and partnered a firm in Europe when it comes to research equipment and manufacturing work.\nChannel NewsAsia understands that another home-grown start-up Life3 Biotech, which develops plant-based protein, is also close to concluding its first funding round.\nNevertheless, start-ups and observers stress that the local food tech scene remains in the infancy stage, with remaining challenges such as the lack of talent.\nSaid Mr Ow: “We definitely need more food scientists here who are driven to change food and nutrition.”\nPlayers in the industry will also need to strategise how to get their innovation out of the labs and onto dining tables, observers said.\nThe founders of Alchemy Foodtech said they are already in talks with several established food manufacturers to do so, and are hopeful that consumers will bite.\n“Food manufacturers have their own research teams but they may be more focused on developing new flavours or textures. With our specialisation in lowering GI, we are in a good position to help manufacturers come up with healthier alternatives faster,” said Ms Goh.\n“Feedback that we got from our studies show that people don’t find a taste difference when our product is added. Taste is crucial in getting acceptance and we think consumers who want the health benefits will accept our product.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     startup ', '     food ']}"

      Succeeding as a hawker: Industry veterans say conditions are challenging but not impossible 
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Walk into any hawker center in Singapore and one might come across one of six food ventures by Yu Kee Group including the eponymous Yu Kee Braised Duck Rice stall.\nApart from their famous duck rice, Yu Kee also owns food brands like Penang Kitchen,\xa0My Kampung Chicken Rice and Suka Ramai. It is also in the business of running food courts with its own two chains,\xa0halal-certified My Kampung Food Court and Kampung Food Court.\xa0\nThe group operates more than than 50 stalls, a quarter of which is located within hawker\xa0centres,\xa0including those run by social enterprises. These so-called\xa0socially-conscious hawker centres (SEHCs) were introduced in 2015 and have been in the spotlight recently as hawkers located within them grapple with the new model of hawker centre management.\nThe government said a\xa0review\xa0of this ""generally sound""\xa0model is underway to allay hawkers\' concerns over low profit margins,\xa0rising operating costs\xa0and challenging\xa0operating conditions.\nYu Kee\xa0founder Seah Book Lock told Channel NewsAsia that the group has come a long way from its hawker beginnings in the 1950s as a street pushcart stall. While he acknowledged the challenging environment for hawkers today, he said they ""can still succeed"" as he did.\nSEIZING THE OPPORTUNITY TO GROW\nMr Seah said Yu Kee started with a stall operated by his father at Lakeview Hawker Centre in the 1970s. In the 1990s, he and his four brothers expanded the business to eight stalls.\xa0\n“Around the 1980s,\xa0I realised that there were a lot of new neighbourhood centres and coffeeshops spaces in Yishun. Rent was cheap at that time and business at these eateries was very good,” he said.\n“People who moved from kampongs to these new flats had some money and they were willing to spend more on food unlike during my father’s day where people mostly ate at home,” Mr Seah added.\nIn the last decade,\xa0Yu Kee decided to set up a central kitchen which helped not only to maintain\xa0quality but also\xa0allowed them to scale up, he said.\xa0\nHowever, just when the business was growing with the central\xa0kitchen, Yu Kee was hit badly by SARS in 2003 and two bouts of Avian flu in 2004 and 2006.\xa0\n“We saw some brands\xa0which were selling chicken or duck dishes shutter their business and did not recover from that time,” said Mr Seah.\n“After the second Avian flu outbreak, we were scared by how affected the business was and I decided that we had to venture beyond duck rice. We started with Suka Ramai which offered halal char kway teow,” he added. The new brands came about after research and development of new recipes.\nLike Mr Seah,\xa0former hawker Jimmy Soh seized an opportunity to start Tenderfresh\xa0in 1982, which offers\xa0fried chicken\xa0at an affordable price.\n""Last time people rarely went to KFC. Only during birthdays or celebrations. At that time, nobody sold fried spring chicken at all. We were the only one,"" Mr Soh said.\xa0\nThe business idea was sparked when he worked as a chicken salesman. He noticed that his customers were rejecting undersized chickens for larger ones. He decided to sell them as fried chickens\xa0as he did not want\xa0to let\xa0them go to waste.\nIn the first year at Whitley Road Hawker Centre, business was ""really bad"" and Mr Soh\'s stall chalked up meagre sales - S$50 to S$60 daily.\n""I was forced to add new products to the menu\xa0like barbecued chicken wings. That recipe was so good that before I opened my stall, orders would come in for say, 300 pieces of BBQ wings and spring chicken,"" he said.\xa0\nAfter a few years a second Tenderfresh outlet was opened at a coffee shop in Jurong.\n""It\'s not that we made money and so we wanted to expand. I had the thought\xa0that if we had one outlet, there is a limit to how much money we can make. So we decided for my wife to open a second outlet so we can make more. We had the dream to grow bigger,"" he said.\xa0\nMr Soh said he wanted his brand to be seen everywhere and to become a household name\xa0so the company expanded rapidly and worked on its branding. For instance, the brand works with\xa0actor-host Ben Yeo who co-owns several outlets. From a hawker stall, Tenderfresh expanded first through coffeeshops but later moved onto having its own eateries\xa0such as its flagship store on Cheong Chin Nam Road and hawker-themed restaurant Hawkerman.\xa0\n""We had an outlet in Clementi and that\'s where the universities are. So we targeted students and came to be a student favourite,"" Mr Soh said.\xa0\nTenderfresh now has 68 outlets across its food brands. It also has a presence in regional capital cities such as Kuala Lumpur and\xa0Yangon. At one point, it had more than 100 outlets but some had to shutter due to manpower shortages.\xa0\n""At the end of the day, hawker work is very tough work. I have worked those hours and I know it myself. 14 to 16 hours a day with little breaks, it is not an attractive job,"" Mr Soh said.\xa0\nWhile operating conditions now may be different from when the two men started as hawkers, Mr Seah was optimistic that hawkers today can still succeed\xa0regardless of where their stalls are, SEHC or not.\nWhat is important is the recipe, the hawker\'s commitment\xa0to consistency and quality and good service, said Mr Seah. That is half the battle won, Mr Soh said.\xa0\nDIFFICULT CONDITIONS TODAY, BUT STILL POSSIBLE TO SUCCEED\nMr Soh said that when Tenderfresh\xa0first started out at Whitley Road Hawker Centre in the 80s, monthly expenses including rent and miscellaneous charges\xa0were about S$230. Today, running a hawker stall\xa0can run one\'s expenses up to S$3,000 to S$4,000, he said.\nHowever, he was quick to point out that the environment then was different.\xa0\n""There were\xa0not really these extra services like cleaning services and the area was quite dirty,"" he said. There were also subsidies for first-generation hawkers who moved from the streets to newly-built hawker centre premises, he added.\xa0\nApart from operational costs,\xa0raw material\xa0costs have gone up over the years and\xa0food prices are not commensurate with the increases, he added.\n""Over the years, these costs have increased by 40 to 50 per cent. The selling price has not\xa0increased 40 to 50 per cent. The selling price increased only about 20 to 30 per cent. In a way, they are earning less than first-generation hawkers,"" he said.\xa0\nTenderfresh used to offer its fried\xa0spring chicken\xa0for S$3.50 in the 80s.\nToday, it continues to offer\xa0the same signature fried chicken\xa0but at\xa0S$10.50. But the chickens used are now bigger and can be shared by two to\xa0three persons.\xa0\nDespite that, rising costs have eroded profit margins to about 5 per cent, he said. But\xa0Tenderfresh makes up for it in its volume of sales and collaborations with other F&B brands, Mr Soh added.\xa0\nIn such an environment, he acknowledged that hawkers need a strong commitment to succeed, adding that other jobs would offer better perks such as annual leave entitlement, medical benefits and regular working hours.\xa0\n""When the younger generation come out to work, they can look for a S$3,000 to S$4,000 job easily.\xa0When they come to join as a hawker, I doubt they can get\xa0S$3,000 to S$4,000. Some even can make S$1,000 to S$2,000 or even in worse cases, make losses. So do you think it\'s worth for them to give the hawker trade a try?"" said Mr Soh.\xa0\nMr Soh wondered if Tenderfresh would be as successful if it was to start and operate in the current environment.\xa0\n\nSUPPORTING\xa0HAWKERS TODAY\nTo support the vocation, Mr Soh has partnered up with young hawkers by opening up his centralised kitchen to help them deal with rising costs while expanding their business.\xa0\nMr Soh said that in the last few years, Tenderfresh has worked with four second- and third-generation hawkers including Yong Tan, the\xa0son of ""Hokkien Mee Master"" Tan Kue Kim, to preserve his father\'s legacy.\xa0\nUnder the collaboration of more than a year, an area was carved out of Tenderfresh\'s high-tech\xa0central\xa0kitchen to allow Warong Kim to scale up its food production with savings.\xa0\nThe brand expanded to set up two hawker stalls Warong Kim\'s Goreng Delights at two SEHCs at Our Tampines Hub and Kampung Admiralty.\xa0\n""For them to start up themselves, it\'s very costly. They have to put in S$300,000 to S$400,000 to start a central kitchen. You must also have at least 15 outlets then your central kitchen will make sense if not it will be a cost burden,"" he said.\n""It\'s also a win-win situation. I can have more business, my volume will grow. What we can supply them is way much cheaper,"" he added. The collaboration puts him in touch with F&B owners that could potentially complement the food offerings under Tenderfresh and diversify his business, he said.\xa0\nIn this way,\xa0Mr Soh said he can also extend a hand to help young hawkers\xa0and preserving\xa0disappearing traditional dishes.\n""You can succeed. Have a good recipe. Aim for quality instead of quantity or extras like \'Instagrammable food\' and so on. These things are no use,"" he said.\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     hawker culture ', '     food ']}"

      The banana money trail: Prices rising in Singapore, but farmers not gaining
  </h1>, 'text': ""DAVAO, Philippines: Of all the types of bananas his family’s fruit business sells, the Philippine Cavendish variety is the most popular, owing to its appearance.\n“They look almost perfect. There are fewer blemishes and fewer scratches, compared to the Malaysian ones,” said retailer Ben Phua. “Malaysian bananas have black spots.”\nThose spots are actually sugar spots and thus equate to sweeter bananas, but “not many consumers are willing to accept the look of the bananas”.\nThe price he pays for the Cavendish variety, however, has gone up by 25 per cent in the past three years. That works out at around 50 cents more per kilogramme, which is passed on to customers.\nThe reason for the hike is a fungal disease – one that all banana growers fear – which struck the Philippines hard in 2015 and has since wiped out plantations.\nThe country went from supplying 49.5 per cent of Singapore’s bananas that year to 37 per cent last year, or 21,900 tonnes – although that is not the only issue, as the series For Food’s Sake! discovers.\nShockingly, many farmers do not get a single cent from the price rise. Instead, they must bear the twin burdens of the epidemic and of continuing to produce bananas for consumers. They are given no other choice. (Watch the episode here.)\nPANAMA DISEASE\nIn 2014, the Philippines was the world’s second-largest exporter of bananas – after Ecuador – with the Davao region in the southern island of Mindanao\xa0as its banana production hub.\nBut by 2016, the country dropped to sixth because of what is known as the Panama disease, which blocks the banana plant’s water system, causing its stem to rot and leaves to wilt.\nTo date, the disease – which is spread through the soil and water run-off – has destroyed more than 15,000 hectares of bananas in the region.\nThere is no cure; the only way to arrest the spread of the fungus is to burn the infected plants to the ground.\nFarmers are also advised to replace their bananas with more a resistant variety. But more resistant means more expensive and a lower yield, and is no guarantee against infection either.\n“In the older varieties, the infection rate is at 50 to 100 per cent. The infection rate for the resistant variety is lower, at 20 to 40 per cent,” said plant pathologist Rogelio Gutierrez from the country’s Department of Agriculture.\nThere is little else the farmers can do. “Once an area has been infected … even after three decades, if you replant bananas in the area, the fungus will always resurface,” he explained.\nThe impact on farmers like Mauro Jonas has been severe. “For every hectare I’ve replanted, I’m forking out about 350,000 pesos (S$9,150) in expenses. So our debts ballooned. And we’re still not earning any income,” said the 42-year-old.\n“Until now, I’m struggling to pay my workers’ salaries on time. Sometimes I even have to pay them quarterly. That’s how tough it’s been.”\nWHY FARMERS AREN’T COMPENSATED\nIt is thanks to a land distribution programme in the 1990s that small-scale farmers own almost half of the banana farms in the Philippines now. But many of them lack the capital to produce quality bananas for export.\nTo finance their operations, they enter into contracts with multinational companies, which help to pay for the pesticides and fertilisers needed, among other things.\nBut there is a caveat: In the contract, the farmer must agree to sell his bananas exclusively to the company and at a fixed price for up to 15 years – epidemic or otherwise.\n“This is why farmers are struggling,” said 33-year-old Elizar Diayon, a farmer tending two hectares of land in the Compostela Valley province.\nHe gets paid 180 pesos per box of bananas, which is “too low” and “not even enough” to feed his family. And yet, “many farm owners don’t have any choice” but to accept the prices set by the companies.\n“The cost of the chemicals and other farming inputs are also deducted from what the company pays for our bananas,” he added.\nHe, for one, is trying to find a better-paying job. But there are around 45,000 farmers locked into such contracts. And their work is not easy, as bananas are “so hard to care for”, said Mr Diayon.\n“You need to place a cellophane sheet (in between the layers) to prevent the bananas from bruising,” he cited.\nHe added: “We also cover the bananas with newspaper to prevent sunburn. Lastly we have to cover the whole bunch with plastic. This prevents ants and bats from gaining access to the bananas.”\nHarvesting is also done manually. The bunches of bananas are heavy, so padded carriers are used to prevent the fruits from bruising.\nAll these steps are taken in order to pass the checks of supermarkets overseas. But in Singapore, the bananas may retail at up to 11 times what the Philippine farmer earns.\nPACKERS SHORT-CHANGED TOO\nWhile the farmers take great care of their fruits, do the multinationals do the same for them? According to Mr Diayon, the companies pay for crop dusting, but are not issuing enough protective gear.\n“We can’t wear the gear any more because it’s torn. They should issue new ones twice a year, but they only issue once a year,” he said.\n“I can feel that I’m getting weaker (from the pesticide). Sometimes I can go to work only a few times a week. Sometimes I’d vomit. I’m also having difficulties swallowing because my throat has become dry.”\nLawyer Irvin Sagarino, from the non-profit advocacy group Initiatives for Dialogue and Empowerment through Alternative Legal Services (Ideals) Inc., Philippines, has observed how the companies are putting farmers at a loss.\n“The quality of life and the financial situation of many banana farmers haven’t really improved. In contrast, banana companies seem to be getting bigger and bigger,” he said.\n“The problem lies in getting accurate data (on the selling price of bananas). Without hard data, it isn’t easy to prove that only the big companies are profiting. (They) will never share this information.”\nIt is not only the farmers but also the banana packers who have been taken for granted. The latter are the ones who sort, wash and pack the fruits at packing plants owned by export companies.\nThis process is hard to mechanise because bananas are easily damaged. So without the legions of packers, the production chain would come to a halt.\nFor years, they have been fighting to be hired as regular staff, and not freelancers from agencies under contract with the banana companies. If those business contracts are terminated, they would lose their jobs.\nLast year, a decade after a case was filed, the Supreme Court ruled that there was “substantial evidence” of an employer-employee relationship between one major exporter and its workers.\nThe court issued an order allowing a trade union to represent the workers in demanding the regularisation of their working arrangements and the granting of benefits.\nThese workers have also not benefited from the price hike. For years, they have been paid around 100 pesos a day at most – equivalent to what Singaporeans pay for a bunch of bananas.\nBLAME GAME\nIf so little of what consumers pay goes to the farmers and packers, then where has the money gone?\nPhilippine Banana Growers and Exporters Association executive director Stephen Antig claims that the exporters are also tied to a fixed price through contracts with international traders, including from Singapore.\n“Big corporate farms sign contracts with importers on a yearly basis, and prices are set annually … That has always been a sore point,” he said.\n“There was (once) we proposed that there should be a sharing of the profit, but they never agreed to open their books. And for that reason, we didn’t bother to insist, otherwise it might affect our relationship.”\nIt is a “known fact”, he added, that wholesalers are “raking it in”.\nTheir usual explanation is: ‘We have to take care of the warehouse. We have to take care of the distribution to the retailers. And it entails a lot of cost.’\nThe importers, in their turn, blame the exporters. Although the For Food’s Sake! team asked both sides for months, neither were willing to show any concrete numbers. What is certain is that the farmers are at the losing end.\nIn a 120-page study published this year, non-governmental organisation Oxfam found that banana farmers in the Philippines, especially in Mindanao, were “food insecure”. This means that they or a family member “had gone without enough food in the previous month”.\nOf the 147 farmers and packers interviewed, 37 per cent were moderately food insecure and 38 per cent were severely food insecure.\nThere is not much consumers in Singapore can do about that for now, until Fairtrade bananas become an option here. Fairtrade guarantees farmers a minimum price per box, which could possibly give Filipino farmers nearly double the current amount.\n“But that doesn’t mean this trip (to the Philippines) has been for nothing,” said programme host Lennard Yeong. “We’ve taken a big first step in realising the imbalance of power and profit in the banana supply chain.”\nWatch this episode of For Food's Sake!\xa0here.

      Fish balls made by hand and sold out daily? Meet one of a rare breed of hawkers
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: After scraping and mincing the flesh of the yellow-tail fish, hawker Tan Chee Meng grabs a fistful of it, massaging gently.\nAs he squeezes the mixture between his thumb and index finger, he uses a spoon to form it into a ball, which is then dropped into a simmering pot of water. This process is tedious, time-consuming, and some say inefficient.\nBut it pays off. By 1pm, his Hup Kee fish ball noodles would be sold out.\nDespite the roaring business, and the prospect of more sales by using pre-mixed fish paste or embracing automation, he insists on sticking to the traditional methods.\n“We’ve persisted for so long already. If we aren’t able to scrape the fish meat, we’d find other ways till we’re no longer able to do so,” he said.\n“We won’t consider fish paste … We’d (rather) give up on the business.”\nThis hawker from Malaysia, who operates a fish ball noodle stall in an Ang Mo Kio coffee shop, is one of very few hawkers in Singapore who still make their unevenly-shaped fish balls from scratch. And he’s proud of it.\nSTEPPING IN AFTER HIS MUM’S DEATH\nThe 38-year-old owes his skills to his father Tan Ah Chong, who started making fish balls in Pahang in the 1980s with his wife.\nBusiness was good, but his wife fell sick and subsequently died, leaving him devastated and unmotivated to continue with the trade.\nSo the younger Mr Tan stepped in, after completing his studies, to help his father. And he has been doing this for 20 years now.\nHe started off doing the “dirty” work: Descaling the yellow-tail fish (commonly used for making fish balls), removing the head and filleting the flesh. He also had to observe closely how his father made the fish balls.\n“This isn’t a skill that you can easily catch on to,” he said. “It takes time to accumulate experience. After some time, you’d understand the process.”\nScraping the fish requires a good measure of experience; the bones are located along the middle, so one must be careful and not apply too much pressure there.\nAnd one must scrape from the tail towards the head, to avoid getting fish bones into the flesh.\nThere is no big secret to their recipe, quipped the younger Mr Tan – just some salt, pepper and water, as far as they would let on. And mixing the yellow-tail fish with flour or other fish is a no-no.\n“It’s purely fish meat inside the fish balls,” affirmed his father. On the choice of yellow-tail fish, the 68-year-old said its flesh has plenty of texture and that “fish balls made of this are tenderer”.\n“The quality is very good. It’s good for the body too, and satisfying,” he added. “Every day, we have to finish selling the fish balls, to keep them fresh … But we often don’t have enough to sell.”\nBy scraping the fish themselves, they can control the texture and the taste, they said, insisting that their loyal customers would be able to tell the difference between a handmade fish ball and a factory-made one.\nMACHINERY A MISTAKE, COMING TO S’PORE WASN’T\nAt one point, the family did invest in machinery to churn out more fish balls. But that turned out to be a mistake, said the elder Mr Tan.\n“We didn’t sell the machine-made fish balls because even after many attempts, they were horribly made,” he said, adding that the look and texture of the fish balls ended up like tofu.\nOr as his son put it, “They weren’t fit for consumption.”\nThe father had visited a fish ball factory before, and knew how fast automation could be. But the machine he bought was left unused ever since they found it ineffective.\n“It’s very fast … but we aren’t taking up the challenge. No way,” he said. “For our production, it has to be done this way … Business would be good (but) it’s whether the taste is acceptable or not?”\nAbout two years ago, the younger Mr Tan and his brother decided to venture into Singapore to try their luck. Business was slow in the first year, and they had to put in long hours.\nBut over time, they built up a customer base with their handmade fish ball noodles. His day now starts at 6.30am, when he leaves home to prepare the food and open the stall at 7.30am.\nTheir work is not done when they are sold out, however: They would make fish balls until about 9pm for the next day.\n“Every fish needs to be personally scraped by me. It can’t be rushed,” he said. “Thus, making fish balls takes very long hours.”\nCustomers who turn up at his stall often ask, “Hai you ma (Still have any to sell)?”\nThose who are turned away may complain that he makes too few fish balls, but he would explain that since it is labour-intensive, production is limited. He would then point them to another fish ball noodle stall nearby.\n“When there are many customers, and we end up being sold out early, there’s no choice. We can’t produce our stuff on the spot,” he told CNA Insider, estimating that he makes up to 500 fish balls and 70 fish cakes on weekdays – and more at the weekend.\nHe has engaged a helper to ease his load by, for example, slicing shallots, chilli and dried bean curd. But she does not touch the fish balls.\nDISAPPEARING CRAFT\nMany yong tau foo or fish ball noodle stalls may claim that their products are handmade but are referring only to the shaping process.\nIn many cases, they buy ready-made paste from the factories and shape it at their stalls, hence fish balls from different stalls end up tasting the same.\nBut with people today focused on fast production output for “high returns”, the older Mr Tan understands why more are using fish paste – and rendering the art of handmade fish balls a disappearing one.\n“Youngsters aren’t learning this manual work because it’s too slow and low in production,” he said. “All are not learning. And the older ones have no energy to continue. This will disappear.”\nWhile several individuals have approached his family, looking for a partnership, he said production quantity was still a handicap.\n“But it (the quantity) is really limited. We can’t cope already with one stall, why bother opening a second? Hence we didn’t proceed to think about it,” he explained.\nBoth father and son acknowledged that without technology to increase production, they will not make it big. And they seemed content with that.\n“In a way, we aren’t able to make a lot of money. It seems good business … but you can’t have both,” said the older Mr Tan.\n“You need to ensure quality standards and … produce large quantities. I’m not sure how to handle this. Thus, it’s about having a clear conscience, doing one’s best in what one does.”\nRead about the\xa0family business that went from a kampung shed to a fish ball empire, built on automation.\n', 'related_topics': ['     food ', '     consumer ', '     CNA Insider ']}"

      From a kampung shed, how a family fishball empire was built on automation
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: It was in a shed behind their kampung house in Changi where the Lim family first made fish balls by hand – scraping, seasoning, mixing and moulding yellow-tail fish into balls well into the night.\nPatriarch Lim Boon Chay got into this trade out of necessity; as a provision shop owner in the 1970s, fish balls were among his best-selling items, but the quality and supply provided to him were inconsistent.\nOne of his customers recommended that he make his own fish balls, generously shared a recipe and taught him how to do it.\nMr Lim’s eldest daughter Novelle, who was a toddler then, recalled spending many hours playing at the shed, watching her parents and grandparents at work, and then helping out during the holidays when she was in primary school.\nThey even operated stalls at a wet market during the peak Chinese New Year period, when she would pitch in overnight.\nThat was how the DoDo brand of fish balls started, growing to a 150,000-square-foot factory in Senoko Way – and another in Malaysia.\nToday, with a workforce of 500, the two factories process over 15 tonnes of fish meat daily and more than 60 varieties of fish-based foods, such as yong tau foo products, for Singapore and some 20 overseas markets.\nBut all this would not have happened if Mr Lim did not have the foresight to venture into automation early on.\n“If we’d continued to make fish balls by hand, we wouldn’t have been able to grow the business because there’d\xa0be a limitation on the production volume,” said Ms Lim, the deputy CEO of Thong Siek Global, which also distributes the DoDo fish balls and other products.\nKAMPUNG TO FLAT, SHED TO FACTORY\nThe family’s big break came in the 1980s, when they had to move from their kampung house to a public flat, forcing them to upgrade their fish-ball-making shed to a proper factory. But operations were still labour-intensive.\nIt was during this time that Mr Lim travelled to Osaka, Japan on a study trip, and learned that fish balls could be frozen and were found in many forms and flavours there.\n“When he came back, he said, ‘Oh, this business can grow very big. It can grow beyond Singapore.’ And that’s when he started to look at exporting our products,” recalled his 42-year-old\xa0daughter.\nHe decided to automate processes to increase the output, and introduced the concept of vacuum-packed fish balls, which gave the product a four-week shelf life.\n“I think, in the 1990s, we were the first company to sell fish balls in the supermarket,” Ms Lim said proudly.\nAfter adopting the Japanese way of production, they were able to increase their output from three tonnes a year in the 1970s to more than six tonnes in 1984 to nearly 5,500 tonnes of all products today.\nTheir fully automated lines now include grinding, processing and auto-packaging facilities.\nWhen they first ventured into mass production, however, their challenge was to maintain the taste and quality of their fish balls. They had to design processes to suit their recipes.\nTo start off, they decided to use raw materials from Japan. “We knew there was already processed fish meat that we could use. It was consistent in quality and there was no fish odour, as compared to handmade,” she said.\nThe fish paste, or surimi, from Japan is composed mainly of fish. “This was the turning point of the business. So our product became more consistent in terms of quality,” added Ms Lim.\n“Along the way, of course, when we formed the fish balls into shape, it was by hand, (but now) we were using machines.”\nNow, they import surimi from many countries, such as Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia.\n“They wash away all the blood of the fish … the water-soluble protein, and what’s left are the proteins that are good for making fish balls,” Ms Lim said, adding that the taste is no different from their handmade fish balls.\nTAKING THE BUSINESS TO THE NEXT LEVEL\nThe family also invested in equipment from Japan to blend the seasoned paste (it contains yellow-tail fish fillet) based on their recipe.\nThe paste goes along an automated line, where a machine moulds it in the shape of a fish ball, which then passes through a metal detector, is cooked, vacuum-packed and frozen before it is distributed locally or overseas.\nFor the fresh fish balls, there is a “hand-shaped” machine to mimic the irregular texture of real handmade fish balls.\nMr Lim is so particular about their quality of the products that there is even a machine called a texture analyser. It mimics the human biting action, testing the hardness and flexibility of the fish ball from the production line.\nOne of the staff also samples and grades the fish ball. “It should be springy and firm,” said one of the quality control supervisors.\nThe paste is regularly sent to the research and development team to test its quality before it is made into fish balls.\nAs a small and medium enterprise, the company faced challenges, such as funding and talent retention, when the business was growing.\nBut Ms Lim acknowledged the support from various agencies, such as the Economic Development Board, the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority and Enterprise Singapore (formerly International Enterprise Singapore and Spring Singapore).\nIn 2015, Thong Siek Holdings received a further boost when food catering firm Neo Group bought a 55 per cent stake in it for S$7.35 million.\nFollowing the acquisition, Thong Siek expanded into new markets such as North America, Europe and Hong Kong.\n“We’ve come a long way, I think – from a family-run, backyard business to a structured, corporate business because we’re now part of the Neo Group,” said Ms Lim.\n“We’re now more structured, with policies in place, with management systems … My dad has brought the company to this level. I think, together with Neo Group, we’ll be moving the business to the next level.”\nIS HANDMADE BETTER THAN FACTORY-MADE?\nAlthough automation has taken over the operations, some processes are still too delicate to be done by machinery and are largely done by hand, such as the cutting of yong tau foo and inserting the fish paste.\nApart from supermarket chains, some of the company’s clients include stall owners, who find it difficult to hire manpower to make the yong tau foo items from scratch.\n“It’s really tiring. They’d have to get up very early in the morning, like 3am or 4am,” said Ms Lim.\n“(Many) stall owners don’t do the fish balls from scratch any more. Some of them buy the yellow-tail fillet from us (or) the ready-made paste … They’d just need to form them into shapes – into the fish balls – at their stalls.”\nShe has become so familiar with the products, especially the yong tau foo, that when she patronises a stall, she can recognise the taste of the paste if it is from DoDo.\nWhen asked if there is value in still making fish balls by hand, Ms Lim said it does “touch people’s hearts”.\n“People think it’s different, although the taste and texture are the same as what we produce in the factory. It’s the sentimental value, I think,” she added.\nShe disagreed that traditional fish balls are necessarily better than factory-made ones. Her factory, she maintained, produces good fish balls, similar to what some hawkers make on their own.\nTo produce its fresh local fish balls, the factory uses yellow-tail fish from Indonesia, which the supplier fillets and freezes before exporting.\n“The process is the same with the hand-scraped ones. We’d blend them, form them into shapes, and the difference is we won’t cook it, so that our consumers would buy the fresh fish balls to cook back home,” she said.\n“The key to the taste is the raw materials we use.”\nTo her, making fish balls is not only a business, but also a passion, having grown up with the product.\n“I think fish balls are now one of the signature products of Singapore. We’re proud to be part of this business,” she said.\n“I’ve seen it evolving from a backyard business to automation, from the Singapore market to the overseas market. So I’ve this mission to grow this business and bring this product to the world.”\nRead about one of a rare breed of hawkers whose fish balls are made by hand and sold out daily.\n', 'related_topics': ['     food ', '     consumer ', '     CNA Insider ']}"

      What politics and drugs have to do with the hike in rice prices
  </h1>, 'text': 'THAILAND/SINGAPORE: Because of its taste and texture, it is the key ingredient in the old favourite among Singaporeans, chicken rice. Hom Mali – or fragrant Thai jasmine rice – is also preferred by local Chinese restaurants.\nIt is one of Thailand’s premium exports, and the World Rice Conference has named it the world’s best rice five times since 2009. But that quality, for the most important staple in Asia, has come at an increasingly higher price.\nFor hawker Wong Teck Tham, the cost of the rice had increased by more than 10 per cent over the past five years, to about S$100 for every 50 kilogrammes.\nHe was shocked, however, when it then increased to S$108 around the middle of this year. “I’ve never used rice that’s so expensive,” he said.\nBut the\xa0hike has been far steeper for local rice importers: Up by 58 per cent since last year, according to the Singapore General Rice Importers Association.\nAnd with the price of Thai jasmine rice now at its highest in a decade owing to a supply shortage, they will have to remain on the alert for more hikes, as the series For Food’s Sake! discovers. (Watch the episode here.)\nHARVESTED ONCE A YEAR\nSingapore imports more rice from Thailand than from any other country. And the kingdom’s north-eastern province of Ubon Ratchathani is one of the main areas for growing Thai jasmine rice, which can thrive because of the soil and climate there.\nBut unlike other types of rice that farmers elsewhere can produce up to five times a year, Thai jasmine rice is harvested only once a year. And a delicate balance is involved.\n“We need water to run into the fields to a depth of 15 centimetres,” said farmer Vichai Pimpam.\n“If it rises any higher than that, it isn’t good because the rice stalks won’t grow straight, and the wind would blow it over easily.\nHerein lies a major issue. Owing to insufficient public funding, the irrigation system is lacking in the province. So a successful harvest depends on the whims of the weather.\nAnd extreme weather has not been uncommon in recent years. In 2016, Thailand experienced its worst drought in decades, and Ubon Ratchathani was one of the provinces that suffered the most.\nThe supply of Hom Mali rice from the harvest at the end of last year was also quite low, said Thai rice exporter Khajornkiat Sa-Nguankulchai.\nFactors such as the dry weather as well as floods caused the shortage, which in turn caused the price to increase, added Mr Chokchai Lorattanakul, the managing director of Ubonsangcharoen Rungruang Rice Mill.\nHe does not expect rice production this season to be better. And there has already been good demand this year, domestically and internationally, for the stocks that Thailand has, noted Mr Khajornkiat.\nRICE SCHEME GONE SOUR\nBut the weather has not been the only notable factor. A rice-pledging scheme from 2011 to 2013 under the previous government – headed by former Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra – has also been costly.\nThe programme encouraged farmers to grow as much rice as possible and bought the crop from them at 50 per cent higher than the market price. The supply was then stockpiled to create an artificial shortage to jack up prices.\nWhile the policy proved popular in the rural areas, the government could not sell the rice at prices covering the purchase cost, administration and storage. And a political scandal erupted.\nEventually the funds dried up, leaving hundreds of thousands of farmers unpaid and millions of tonnes of rice rotting in warehouses.\nThe cost to the country? An estimated 640 billion baht (S$26.7 billion), said Thailand Development Research Institute distinguished fellow Nipon Poapongsakorn, an expert on the Thai rice industry.\nAfter the military government came into power in 2014, it changed tack and encouraged farmers to diversify by growing other crops or stop farming altogether. This has contributed to the shortage of Hom Mali rice.\nAGEING FARMERS, POVERTY AND DRUGS\nGoing forward, prices may also continue to rise because young people do not want to become farmers. The income is too low and the risks too high for them, so they are moving to the cities.\nThis is becoming a serious issue, as the average age of Thai rice farmers is now 51. “In north-eastern Thailand, the agricultural land and labour are declining,” highlighted Knowledge Network Institute of Thailand senior fellow Somporn Isvilanonda.\n“At the same time, the remaining workforce is ageing. These factors are affecting the price.”\nTake, for example, 35-year-old Charuwan Chanthop, a daughter of rice farmers from Ubon Ratchathani. She moved to Bangkok when she was 16 and owns an art gallery now.\n“My family was poor. We knew nothing but farming. I asked myself, ‘Did I really want to be a farmer?’ Then I decided to leave and move to Bangkok to find a job that can support my family,” she said.\nThe drugs infesting her province, along one of the trafficking routes in the Mekong region, played a part in that decision.\n“My home town has a drugs problem. There are a lot of drug dealers in my village, so (families) want to send the kids away … (to help them) escape the problem,” she said.\nTACKLING THE PROBLEMS\nOne of the ways to overcome the labour shortage is to use technology. “More farmers are reducing costs by, for example, using machinery to harvest crops, as labour cost is higher during harvest season,” cited Dr Somporn.\nIn the long run, seed treatment using a chemical coating process can help to prevent shortages caused by diseases, insects and drought or heat.\n“This protects the rice in its first 30 days after planting. So just like a little baby … you need to protect it early on,” explained Syngenta head of seed-care (Asia-Pacific) Saad Haroon.\nThe agrotechnology company’s treated seeds may cost 10 to 30 per cent more than regular seeds, but such technology can pave the way to a brighter future for farmers.\n“This leads to approximately 6 to 7 per cent yield improvement,” said Mr Saad. “(The grower) has more rice that’s produced, and he can sell more and get more profit.”\nMeanwhile, consumers in Singapore must depend on rice importers to mitigate the impact of the price hikes and sudden shortages. Keeping stockpiles is one way of doing this, as shown by Singapore General Rice Importers Association chairman Michael Hiu.\nEven though he is forced to buy rice at a higher price, his stockpile means he is not at the mercy of Thai exporters.\nAnd he has raised his selling price for supermarkets, restaurants and hawkers by only one to two per cent each time, taking a cut in his profit margin.\n“They’re still our customers – their survival is equal to our survival,” he explained. “If we raise the price too high, we might lose the customers.”\nWhen asked about the cost of Thai rice going forward, however, he was not optimistic. “Based on current trends and the current (market) situation, we don’t foresee there’ll be a drop in the price,” he said.\nWatch this episode here.

      The harsh realities behind the rising sugar cane prices in Singapore
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: They are too young to have beer. But the many youngsters who go to the Chomp Chomp Food Centre at Serangoon Gardens can still drink to their heart’s content from the popular tower dispensers at the hawker centre.\nThe quenchers on their tables are sugar cane towers, however, and not beer – drink stall owner Brendon Tan’s solution for his thirsty customers.\n“We used to sell smaller cups,” he said. “Gradually we upsized from 700 millilitres to 1 litre, then 1.5 litres. People were looking for (a bigger) jug, so I thought maybe we can try a sugar cane tower.”\nIn the past year though, he had to raise the prices of the juice – for the first time in the two decades he has been selling the drink. A tower now costs S18, up from S$15.\nIn fact, the cost of sugar cane in Singapore has risen by much more. Between last November and this July, the price per box rose from around S$16.50 to S$29 – a 75 per cent increase.\nWith food prices rising by more than 10 per cent over the past five years, the series For Food’s Sake finds out what is behind the hikes in the prices of various foods and beverages.\nIn the case of sugar cane, it is a shortage like never before, said Mr Ray Sng, one of the co-founders of Daily Fresh Sugarcane Supplier, whose customers saw other drink stall owners experience a disruption to their supply.\n“Some of my customers in other hawker centers (told me) they’re selling (sugar cane) three days in a week,” he said.\nOn the other four days, they’ve no supply to sell. Or even when they have, they sell it until lunchtime because they have one or two boxes only.\nAnd the factors coming into play are not only short-term, but also long-term.\nWHAT THE RAINS AND FLOODS DID\nSingapore imports more than 99 per cent of its sugar cane from Malaysia, where the best areas for growing the plant are in the western states, such as Negeri Sembilan, Perlis, Kedah and Perak as well as in Muar, Johor.\nSugar cane’s water requirements are higher than other arable crops, yet too much water can also create problems, as presenter Lennard Yeong discovered when he travelled to Negeri Sembilan.\nIn the Jelebu district, being next to a river has helped farmer Mohammed Farid, whose family has been growing sugar cane since his father started in the 1970s.\nBut when it rained continuously for five days last December, the downpour flooded his farm, leaving his crop vulnerable.\n“(Too much rain) damages the sugar cane. Some rotted and turned sour,” he said. “I wanted to cry and scream out loud. It was very frustrating and disappointing.”\nIn February, his farm flooded again, along with other farms in the low-lying area – an unprecedented recurrence.\n“The flood was almost three to four feet high. So we had to cut the sugar cane in half (to save some),” he said. “I deployed all 20 of my employees from one area to the next.”\nOn both occasions, he was able to save only about 30 per cent of his sugar cane – a crop with a minimum growing period, ideally, of around nine months.\n“The most difficult thing I’ve ever faced has been to recover (my losses) from the flood,” he added.\nHEADING FOR CLOSURE\nEven if the weather takes a turn for the better, Singaporeans might still have to pay more to get their sugar cane fix in the near future.\nMany of Malaysia’s sugar cane farms are small family holdings, and that model of business may well become a thing of the past.\nTake, for example, Mr Mohd Arif Majid, who runs his two-hectare farm in Negeri Sembilan with the help of only one person: His 50-year-old wife Simisah.\nHe takes pride in that fact, but also struggles to send freshly cut stems to his buyers. While sugar cane is best processed within 24 hours of harvest, he sometimes has to start earlier.\n“If the request is for a lot of sugar cane to be available on Wednesday, maybe we’d have to start cutting on Monday. If the amount is less, then perhaps we’d start cutting on Tuesday afternoon,” he said.\nAge is also catching up on the 55-year-old, who might not have much time left to run the farm. He has four sons, but none of them plans to take over from him.\n“In the sugar cane business, you get your returns only after seven months (when you harvest),” he said. “My four sons prefer to be salaried workers and are working for the government. They feel more comfortable in office clothes.”\nLARGER FARMS SCALING BACK\nThe time-consuming job of planting and cutting sugar cane means owners of bigger farms must rely on foreign labour. And that is also posing a challenge.\nA shortage of workers is farmer Tan Wee Teck’s greatest problem, as the work “is too hot and too tough”. “You have to go row by row to look for the longest (stems),” he said by way of explanation.\nThe shortage extends to the labour-intensive task of processing the crop.\nThis includes removing the skin so the stems look cleaner, which is done manually because “not all sugar cane grows straight”, not to mention that “you have to leave some (skin) on or else the sugar cane would dry out”.\n“It would be very difficult to use a machine,” he said.\nIn 2006, he had around 30 workers – many of whom were Indonesians – in his 40-hectare farm in Muar. Now he has a workforce of 14, which has forced him to halve the size of his farm to 20 hectares.\n“Even if I raise the salary, the younger folks aren’t interested in farming. I can’t attract young locals. There would still be very few interviewees,” he added. “We aren’t able to produce more sugar cane.”\nAfter spending three days meeting farmers, Mr Yeong also found that some of them have started to downsize because the Malaysian authorities have been cracking down on undocumented migrants in the past few years.\nMIDDLEMEN GIVING UP TOO\nAs it turns out, even some middlemen are throwing in the towel.\nFor example, Mr Yap Siong Shee, who used to supply Singapore with sugar cane from farms in southern Malaysia, had to close his shop barely a year into operations because of the decreasing stock.\n“We (had to) go to places farther afield to buy (sugar cane), like Pahang and Perak,” said the former supplier in Malaysia. “(Petrol costs and salaries) became more expensive.\n“(For every) box, we were losing S$3 to S$4. So you can (calculate) that for 200 boxes … we were losing around $600 per day. So how much per month could I lose? So we couldn’t sustain this.”\nIn Singapore, two suppliers also called it quits and were absorbed by Daily Fresh, which delivers enough sugar cane stalks daily to make 50,000 litres of juice.\nThere are six other companies delivering sugar cane to Singapore daily, and it was initially not easy for Daily Fresh, incorporated in April last year, to gain the trust of the licensing companies across the Causeway.\nMr Sng said his company had to pay farms in advance to secure its share of sugar cane. And now its efforts to keep supply coming include a plan to start its own farm, if the land can be acquired.\n“It wouldn’t cover everything, but it would counter part of the problem,” he said. “I don’t think there’ll be a day in Singapore when we … have no sugar cane juice at all.\nFarms have closed down (but) there’ll always be somebody who’s going to come into the market.\nHowever, with consumers footing only a fifth of the current price hike driven by the bad weather – according to the supplier – Mr Yeong could not help wondering whether prices may rise further.\n“With an eye on the bottom line, whether (the big players) can keep the supply going may well depend on how much we’re willing to pay,” he said.\nWatch the series For Food's Sake here.

      No more 'hum' in laksa? Why cockles are becoming costlier and harder to find
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE and MALAYSIA: It has built its reputation on serving see-hum (blood cockles), and the star dish at the Two Chefs Eating House is still its garlic and chilli cockles. The Singaporean restaurant serves over 10 kilogrammes of these cockles daily.\nIn recent times, however, they have become even more precious to owner Lam Chan Wah. Five years ago, they cost him around S$1.50 to S$2 per kg, but that figure is now around S$4.50 because the supply has been dwindling.\nIn 2013, Singapore imported 2,720 tonnes of cockles from Malaysia, the source of more than 99 per cent of the Republic’s live cockles. That has now fallen to 1,700 tonnes last year. So what has happened?\nWith food prices rising by 2.1 per cent a year, on average, over the past five years, the series For Food’s Sake finds out what is behind the hikes in the prices of various foods, from rice to bananas to sugarcane.\nIt is not only about climate change or inflation caused by labour cost. The reasons are scandalous in some cases, such as chicken (price-fixing) and cockles being ruined by the direct impact of human development on the environment. (Watch this first episode here.)\nHowever, for Singaporeans who have grown up eating cockles as a must-have ingredient in their laksa and char kway teow, it is not only a matter of price.\nAs presenter and foodie Lennard Yeong discovered when ordering laksa at a stall, the hawker could not provide more see-hum than the usual amount, not even for extra money, because of the low supply.\nHEADACHE FOR FISHERMEN\nBlood cockles have always been a widely available source of protein in Singapore. They get their name from their red flesh, caused by high levels of haemoglobin. And their slightly metallic flavour makes them a delicacy – like oysters, but cheaper.\nIn Malaysia, cockles are a key income source for fishermen in the main breeding states of Selangor, Perak, Penang and Johor. But it is now a multimillion-ringgit industry teetering on the brink of a crisis.\nIn 2005, the country produced 100,000 tonnes of cockles for export and local consumption. But by 2015, only 16,000 tonnes were harvested. And the shortage is getting more serious.\nTake, for example, Mr Halim Mat Sa’ad from Kuala Juru in Penang. He has been in the business for 20 years, and he went from catching 250 kg of cockles per day in 2014 to 50 kg at most now.\nHis earnings have shrunk by two to three times over those four years, and nothing has prepared him for this problem. He said:\nIt isn’t enough to survive. This income issue gives me a headache.\nCockles spend their lives burrowing in the muddy seabed not far from the shore, and Malaysia’s coastline was once a fertile breeding ground, thanks also to its relatively slow currents.\nBut its cockles are dying off because the natural balance of their habitat is being disturbed. “It’s because the water is contaminated by acid, or chemicals are released into the water, causing pollution and harming the cockles,” said Mr Halim.\nIn Penang, the island’s second bridge to the mainland, completed in 2014, has also affected the fishermen’s livelihood because it changed the water currents, according to him.\n“When the water doesn’t flow fast enough, it causes the mud to build up, so it’s hard for us to fish for them,” he said. “The cockles can’t survive when the mud is too thick.”\nHIGH NITRATE LEVEL\nTo test what is in the water, Mr Yeong enlisted the help of the Centre for Marine and Coastal Studies at the Universiti Sains Malaysia.\nAnd the results of the samples indicated that the nitrate level in the seawater was “pretty high”, said research officer Nithiyaa Nilamani. It is one of two chemical compounds that are especially bad news for cockles. The other is phosphate.\n“Those are the nutrients that come from river runoff,” she said. And high levels of both mean that the mudflats have been affected by chemicals leaking from farms or nearby factories.\n“Nitrite would enter the system of the cockle, and it would bind with the blood system, and it would reduce the oxygen level in the cockles. So that’s how they would suffocate, and it would cause mortality.”\nStudies have traced the impurities to agricultural pesticides as well as waste from industrial and construction sites.\nPenang, for example, has been transformed into a tourism paradise and manufacturing hub over the past 20 years. It has seven industrial parks, including on the mainland, and by 2016, about 3,000 manufacturing companies.\nSMUGGLING AND OVERHARVESTING\nTo protect the cockle population, the Malaysian authorities have limited the amount of cockle spat (young cockles) that can be harvested. These are precious because they can help to culture new cockles.\nBaby cockles caught by fishermen in Johor, for example, are in demand in states like Selangor, Perak and Penang “so they can grow them there”, said Mr Hairul Akbar Saat, the general manager of the Pontian District Fisherman Association.\nThe spat can be distributed only within Malaysia. But not everyone follows the rules. He said:\nYou need a permit to distribute the cockle spat to other (Malaysian) states, but some greedy fishermen who want more income sell them to people who smuggle (the spat) to Thailand.\nThe Thais love cockles as much as the Malaysians do, but their coastline does not produce enough to meet the demand. That is why the smuggled spat can go for as much as five times the price in Malaysia.\nAccording to Mr Hairul, the baby cockles are thrown into cans or gunny sacks and stashed in lorries, usually under legitimate cargo. The spat can live one to two days on land and must then go back into water or perish.\nThere were 33 cases of smuggling reported in 2015 and 35 cases in 2014. Those found guilty may face a two-year jail term or a fine of more than RM80,000 (S$26,450).\nIn general, the overharvesting of baby cockles, when the mature ones are in short supply, makes it even harder for the population to recover, said Dr Hadzley Harith from the Fisheries Research Institute in Penang.\nCockles have a lifespan of about three years, and “if we cut the reproductive cycle … we’re promoting the shortage of cockles in the environment”, he added.\n“Our biggest task is to persuade the local (fishermen) to do proper management and to harvest the cockle (according to the size) … (and) that cockles aren’t an open bank (which they) can harvest daily or every time.”\nWHAT MORE CAN BE DONE\nOne person on a mission to help revive the cockle population is Centre for Marine and Coastal Studies director Aileen Tan. She wants to breed cockles in a fully controlled environment to reduce the dangers of contamination and overharvesting.\n“I’m trying to find other ways to culture cockles rather than in their natural site, which is now considered as polluted. So we’ve introduced cleaner or bigger-sized sediment for them to attach to,” she said.\n“If you see the cockles opening up, that means they’re comfortable with the environment. Digging into the substrate … shows that they’ve already started feeding. That means they’re no longer under stress.”\nAt the centre’s laboratory, Malaysia’s oldest at 35 years old, she has experimented with different kinds of sand for cockles to live in, instead of mud, which gets contaminated easily. And the cockles seem to prefer the finer sediments.\nIf her method works, she thinks that a lot of unused prawn ponds along the coastline can be used to grow cockles, with their favourite type of sediment placed there.\nCages could also be utilised, following the aquaculture example of many other seafood farms across Asia. The cages would protect the cockles from touching the sea floor and river bed, where the heavy metals and other pollutants tend to collect.\nDr Tan believes that these methods will guarantee healthier cockles and reduce their mortality rate.\n“Our waters aren’t going to get better. Capture fisheries aren’t making money any more. Aquaculture is the answer now. So this is the beginning of the aquaculture of cockles,” she said. “We need the cockles back desperately.”\nStill, it would take a while for the population to recover through farming and even longer for the price to drop. Are the days of cheap and ubiquitous cockles over, at least for now?\nSaid Mr Yeong: “It feels as if it’s time we get used to eating laksa and char kway teow without cockles, unless you’re willing to pay top dollar.""\nWatch this episode here.

      Ordered via Instagram, served in the 'hood: The chef who wants to unite people through briyani
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Seven\xa0adults and\xa0a toddler sit patiently at an Aljunied Crescent void deck on a breezy Sunday evening.\xa0Time ticks by; it has been more than 20 minutes,\xa0but there is no complaining, just\xa0the\xa0occasional glance at\xa0watches and handphones.\nAnd then\xa0as the lift door opens, conversations are suspended.\xa0\nPlastic containers are doled out, crumpled\xa0bills exchange\xa0hands, and as dusk falls, the loot\xa0is quietly trucked off.\xa0The deepest cravings have been satisfied - a\xa0lucky few have caught the ""drop"".\nThey hail from all parts of Singapore, lured by the promise of tender chunks of meat buried under mounds of\xa0fragrant basmati rice, complemented\xa0with a side of pineapple pickle. This is briyani\xa0so good\xa0it was once sold out in 28 seconds.\n""I have a guy who takes public transport\xa0from Jalan Bahar,\xa0orders one packet, comes here and eats in front of me,"" said the man behind this phenomenon,\xa0Ahmad Zahid. ""There was another girl who took a Grab down from Jurong, finished half her packet of briyani here and then went back to finish the rest of it.""\nBut cooking briyani is\xa0a\xa0pastime for the\xa041-year-old, and\xa0Zahid\xa0doesn\'t really care how many takeout boxes are sold\xa0- so\xa0long as he gets customers\xa0down to what he calls his ""hood"" and rediscover the humble\xa0void deck.\n""When I was growing up, the void deck was the epicentre of all our social activities. It was where we gathered, funerals were here, weddings were held here,"" said\xa0Zahid, who has lived on the estate since he was born.\xa0""I think people have forgotten just how socially significant the void deck used to be. It was a great equaliser.\n""Even if customers\xa0live in a place where there\'s a void deck, they haven\'t had the same experience as I have had. They see it as an empty space they have to cross before going home.""\nThose interested in ordering briyani\xa0have to first shoot\xa0a\xa0""follow"" request to Zahid\'s\xa0Instagram account, ""globalmatsoulkitchen"".\xa0\n""Drops"", where briyani is sold to a limited few,\xa0are announced there\xa0by\xa0posts of\xa0stark, almost Dada-esque, Black Metal inspired imagery, accompanied by\xa0extended, quirky\xa0captions.\nCustomers can then send their orders via WhatsApp to Zahid\'s\xa0mobile number, with orders taken on a first-come-first-served basis.\xa0Those who succeed are then texted pick-up instructions, and they would gather in eager anticipation at a void deck in the Aljunied Crescent neighbourhood.\nThe special of the day can range\xa0from vegan to stingray, honey chicken to mutton briyani.\n""You come here and you wait. It doesn\'t matter what status you have, you are just like anybody else,"" said Zahid confidently. ""And I can assure you that during the time you spend waiting, out of your comfort zone, it will be worth it.""\nZahid\'s briyani draws inspiration from a restaurant in Dubai he visited years ago while on holiday with his then-fiancee.\n""It was a very run-down, humble, unassuming kind of place,"" he explained. ""I looked at the briyani and it was like white rice with brown things below. It was interesting because it was just that and there\xa0was no gravy. But\xa0then I dug into it\xa0and I realised,\xa0this was what it was all about.\n""Having that plate of briyani there, it was almost like time stood still.""\nReturning to Singapore with\xa0several packets in tow, Zahid\xa0spent the next two weeks coming up with a basic recipe. However, finessing the final\xa0formula\xa0took\xa0close to three years.\nFollowing encouragement from friends and family, Zahid, a former bartender, began to whip up small batches of\xa0briyani during his free time.\nIn 2015, he made the career switch to full-time cooking. He currently works as a chef de partie\xa0at Asian restaurant Coriander Leaf.\xa0\n""I decided that this\xa0could be like a school project that never was,""\xa0Zahid\xa0added. ""Nine months after I started (full-time) cooking, I stopped the Instagram project. And when I was able to juggle both, I reactivated the account and started posting again.""\nHe draws his inspiration for cooking from two seemingly contrasting sources: Religion and black metal.\nZahid\xa0quotes the Arabic word ""silaturahim"", which can be translated to ""relations"".\xa0""The nature of the Muslim is that he is not an island, he is part of society and part of something bigger,"" explained Zahid. ""There\'s always a mention of being inclusive, you have to integrate.\n""Food is a conduit for that. It brings people together, it breaks down barriers.""\nZahid\'s Instagram handle is also meant to convey a\xa0sense of spirituality; the term\xa0""Soul Kitchen"" reflects\xa0the Sufi traditions of kitchens being places of refuge.\nThe ""almost-elitism"" and ""standard of excellence"" in\xa0Black Metal music - in particular the Norwegian bands of the second wave of the\xa01990s - also inspires Zahid to strive for the same standards in the food he makes.\n""You knew when these bands\xa0produced any albums that it was going to be good,"" explained Zahid.\xa0""I hope I can achieve the same quality with my cooking.""\nIronically, it\xa0was also a briyani craving which went unfulfilled that\xa0got Zahid started on his culinary journey.\n""In university, there was one particular day when\xa0things were not going great. There\xa0was this place just down the street where my apartment was,\xa0so after school I went to that place because I know they sold briyani,"" recalled Zahid, who was studying in Australia then.\n""When I went there, they said: \'I\'m sorry, we sold out. We will make a fresh batch, so come back at six o\'clock.\'\xa0So in anticipation of a good meal,\xa0I didn\'t eat anything. But when I went down later, they told me that it was not worth making a fresh batch just for one person.\n""That\'s when I knew instinctively, for sure, that never again would I depend on anybody to cook for me a meal. If I wanted to eat anything, I would learn to make it myself.""\nRather than having to rely on having\xa0briyani served up for him,\xa0Zahid now has the opportunity to feed a lucky few with his own take on\xa0the popular dish.\xa0\nA typical work day sees him pull 12-hour shifts, so Zahid takes advantages of days off in his schedule to prepare for ""drops"".\xa0""If the next day is a\xa0day off, I\'d be preparing the night before. If it\'s a lunchtime drop then I\'ll be preparing very early. If it\'s an evening drop, I\'d do a bit of preparation, go to sleep and wake up to continue.""\nZahid, who counts lion dance and playing in black metal bands among his other hobbies, admits that cooking consumes\xa0a large chunk of his leisure time.\n""I do\xa0the preparation, the cooking and the cleaning up,"" he said. ""By the time cooking starts, you know it\'s going to be hot, you\'re going to be thirsty and people are going to keep bugging you on the phone. You have to be in the zone.""\nBut he plans to continue for the foreseeable future.\xa0""(At the void deck), I see customers getting\xa0to know each other while waiting, old friends catching up, colleagues meeting after work,"" he explained.\xa0""This\xa0vindicates my decision to have it here.

      Inside the hospital kitchen: 8 things you never knew 
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: It's a monumental culinary challenge that would daunt any professional kitchen or top restaurant - whipping up some 4,000 meals a day, in three cuisines,\xa0catering to 40 types of diet.\nBut that's all in a day's work for the team of more than 100 staff at the\xa0central kitchen of Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).\nLocated in the basement, this kitchen rustles up\xa0Chinese, Malay/Indian and Western cuisines, for some 1,000 patients whose prescribed diets range widely from\xa0low-fat and\xa0low-purine to\xa0gluten-free.\nAbout the size of three basketball courts, the kitchen was bustling on one morning when CNA Insider was there:\xa0Machinery hummed in the background, and robots parked in one area bleeped, waiting to be activated to deliver the food prepared by the busy cooks.\nSenior production chef Tay Kok Beng is in charge of this crew and oversees the patients’ meals and those for the staff, including doctors.\nOften, he is the subject of the most brickbats, not only from patients complaining that the food is bland and unappetising - but also from colleagues in other departments\xa0who have a big say in the menu.\n“We have to work with dietitians and speech therapists because there’s a restricted diet we need to follow,” Chef Tay, a former hotel chef,\xa0explained, admitting that it is a challenge to balance taste and nutrition.\nHere is what you would want to know about hospital food.\n1. IT TAKES UP TO TWO YEARS TO CREATE A MENU\nMr Tay works in consultation with his colleagues to plan the menu, and it typically takes up to two years to come up with one.\nNot only must they cater for many patients, with a multitude of different conditions and dietary requirements, they are also limited by the number of choices they can provide – it is impossible to personalise every meal.\nBut to offer enough variety, dishes on the menu are not repeated within a 14-day period. So only patients staying longer would eat the same dish again.\nMr Tay’s colleagues also have different concerns, as the menu must meet the nutritional needs of every group of patients – such as vegetarians, those requiring a higher caloric intake, and kidney patients, to name a few – explained speech therapist Karen Chien.\nSo, for instance,\xa0a protein dish like chicken must be able to cater for medical conditions ranging from high cholesterol to diabetes. “There’s no one meal that can accommodate all our patients because (they) are so varied,” said Ms Chien.\n2. THE FOOD IS DIVIDED INTO TEXTURES\nTypically, hospital food is categorised into four textures: Regular (for the majority of patients), easy chew, soft-moist and blended.\nFor example, the blended diet caters for those with a swallowing problem or whose throat or tongue muscles are weak. Dietetic technician Jocelyn Huang described it as having the consistency of “very smooth puree, like baby food”.\nFor the easy-chew diet, the test is that one must be able to crush the food with a fork easily, and the item cannot be more than 1.5 sqcm\xa0in size.\n3. THE WRONG TEXTURE\xa0CAN BE LIFE-THREATENING\nThe speech therapists and dietitians pay attention to the food textures, particularly the blended diet, because of the risk of choking.\nThe blended food must be lump-free. It cannot be too watery nor too sticky, as the food could get into a patient’s airway and end up in the lungs, which can cause a chest infection.\n“That can be life-threatening for our patients, so what we’re trying to achieve is that the patients are safe with the food that we serve,” said Ms Huang.\nEnsuring that the consistency and textures of the food comply with international standards, and that it is appropriate and safe to consume, is one of the roles of her colleague Ms Chien.\n4. THE FOOD IS AUDITED DAILY AND MONTHLY\nThe meals are audited daily, to ensure the suitability of not only the textures but also the taste.\n“Sometimes (the kitchen) might add too much salt. That isn’t suitable for patients on therapeutic diets,” said Ms Huang. “So I’d ask them to … rectify the issue before they start serving the patients.”\nIn checking all three meals, she makes sure that the food presentation is appealing too.\nThere is also a monthly audit of the textures, taste and presentation, among other things, done by a team comprising Ms Huang, Ms Chien, principal dietitian Wong Siew Li, senior nurse manager Hasfizah Mohd Hanef and sous chef Goh Kim Hock.\n5. THE CHEF’S NOT ALWAYS THE BOSS\nMr Tay used to work in a hotel, where he called the shots in the kitchen. Not so now. And his chefs are often restricted in the ways they may enhance the flavour of the food.\nHospital chefs like him often find themselves at loggerheads with the audit team. “The speech therapists ‘fight’ with the chef quite a bit because we need our food to be very specific,” admitted Ms Chien.\n“Sometimes we see some texture inside (the food) that isn’t what we require … But sometimes the chefs are also faced with challenges that are beyond their control.”\nUltimately, it boils down to the patients’ needs. “Safety is the most important thing,” said Mr Tay. “And we want the patients to feel that they’re eating healthily.”\n6. PATIENTS CAN HAVE A SAY\nIf there are patients who dislike the food, Mr Tay or one of his assistants would go to the ward to get their feedback.\n“I can’t say, ‘No, not my problem.’ With the feedback we get, at least we’d know exactly what the patients want,” he said.\nTo address any complaints going forward about bland food, TTSH will be using a salt meter to test the salt content of meals objectively, highlighted Ms Wong. But she acknowledged:\nWhen they’re unwell, usually their taste buds are a bit affected. And even if we agree that (a meal) tastes flavourful … we might still get feedback from them that it’s bland.\nAn initiative the kitchen has already taken, especially for malnourished patients who find the food bland and struggle to finish meals, was to replace the vegetables with a high-calorie dessert, like bubur\xa0 pulut hitam.\n“It’s tasty, it meets the safety requirements and, at the same time, it helps to boost our patients’ nourishment,” Ms Chien said of the glutinous rice dessert.\n7. MACHINES ARE EASING THE LOAD\nThe kitchen has a number of elderly staff – the oldest is a 75-year-old cook – who assist in duties such as preparing the ingredients.\nIn the past, some of them had to wash the rice – up to 270 kg a day – and vegetables by hand, which was bad for their backs, tiring and wasted a lot of water.\nMr Tay found a rice cooker from Japan that would wash the rice and could be programmed to even cook chicken rice. He also bought a vegetable washer, which his staff admit cleans better than them.\n“In those days, you had to wash vegetables like clothes because some of the vegetables had worms and snails. So these are quite powerful (machines with) the pressure to get rid of (even) stones,” said Mr Tay. “All are happy.”\n8. ROBOTS DO THE DELIVERIES\nSome of the kitchen’s newest recruits are a team of 15 robots, known as\xa0automatic guided vehicles, which deliver the food to the wards for the nurses to serve to the patients.\nEach robot can lift about 15 trays of food. They have designated areas and paths to follow. They even have their own lifts. And if you are in its way, it would ask you, nicely, to move aside.\nApart from freeing up manpower in the kitchen, the robots take on other roles such as delivering linen, once they are done with their food rounds, which include bringing back the dirty dishes.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     food ', '     health ', '     CNA Insider ']}"

      Commentary: A piece of Southeast Asia in a Singapore dish
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The sun is setting, and a pot rages to a boil on the stove, the scent of aromatic spices wafting through the air.\nOn the table, fresh chicken is prepped for the oven, while fragrant coconut rice steams steadily in the cooker.\nA little girl sits on a high stool, looking on curiously as vegetables sizzle in a wok while sugar and chilli caramelise in a pan.\nThis is the home many of us grew up in, where food is literally the centre of the universe.\nWe would gather at dusk, sitting in our dining rooms, chatting about our days over a warm bowl of rice and delectable dishes, at times ending dinner with a bowl\xa0of sweet treats – red bean soup, kueh – the list is endless.\nIt is only when we grow older that we start to think more deeply about the origins of our food. As far as we know, Singapore generates precious little of our locally consumed produce. So where does all this food come from?\nSingapore sits in the cradle of Southeast Asia, and our palates have long been accustomed to the diverse and colourful tastes of our region. Yet many of us may not be aware of how much of our food comes from our neighbours.\nSoutheast Asia, a region of robust agricultural development and diversity, has availed the presence of a rich variety of produce making their way to our city-state.\n\n\nFOOD FROM OUR NEIGHBOURS\nIn every well-stocked kitchen in Singapore, one is likely to find at least a few essential products from ASEAN countries. A groceries shopping trip to NTUC Fairprice will reveal several interesting facts about the many origins of our food.\nWhile Malaysia is often perceived to be the main exporter of produce to Singapore, including meat, seafood, spices, fruit and vegetables, much of our kitchen stock also comes from other ASEAN countries.\nThis includes jasmine rice from Thailand, sweet potato and coffee from Vietnam, mangos from Myanmar and the Philippines, and even Kolo Mee from Brunei.\nEven in a simple dish of noodle soup that one might whip up in their kitchen, there might be chicken from Malaysia, organic chye sim from Thailand, and spices from Indonesia.\nIn another local favourite, fried rice, most ingredients are sourced from our neighbours too – rice from Thailand, eggs from Malaysia, garden peas from Vietnam, carrots from the Philippines, garlic and spring onions from Indonesia and shrimp from Brunei.\xa0\nThe region has, literally, come to our kitchen, being present in almost every local Singaporean delicacy, from nasi lemak to char kway teow.\nThe presence of ASEAN in Singapore kitchen is emblematic of the multi-fold and far-reaching benefits of enhanced regional trade in agricultural products.\n\n\nMalaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam are among the top 10\xa0exporters of food products to Singapore.\nThailand and Vietnam especially are among the top three rice exporters to Singapore, accounting for 62 per cent of its total rice imports.\nFOOD SECURITY\xa0\nA number of ASEAN initiatives have been put in place to enhance the sustainability of Singapore’s food imports, including the ASEAN Integrated Food Security (AIFS) Framework which provides an enabling environment for ASEAN member states to operate and cooperate in various aspects related to food production, processing and trade.\nWith the ever-present threat of climate change, episodic droughts, floods and other natural disasters, it is of utmost importance that Singapore join hands with other ASEAN countries to enhance food security in the region, including promoting conducive food market trade, agri-innovation and food security emergency arrangements.\nOne notable achievement in this respect is the ASEAN Plus Three Emergency Rice Reserve established in 2013.\nWith earmarked stocks and voluntary donations from 10 ASEAN member states plus China, Japan and the Republic of Korea, this reserve offers rice supplies for affected countries especially in times of acute emergency.\nNow when I recall my childhood, I think not only of the bursts of flavour in every bite, but the lustrous fields across the region from which my rice and noodles hail.\nWhen it comes to food, ASEAN is ever present in our home as much as we have always been right at home in the ASEAN region.

      Commentary: We are powerless to resist the lure of sinful food 
  </h1>, 'text': 'CANBERRA: The standard economic response to high and rising obesity is to levy what’s known as a “sin tax”. The thinking is simple – add a tax to the price of the undesirable food, this increases its price, and the demand for it goes away.\nHowever, there are both theoretical and empirical reasons to think the end of the obesity epidemic lies not in sin taxes but innovation.\nBehavioural economics teaches us that people don’t tend to make decisions by making fairly involved trade-offs between costs and benefits, as the theory of sin taxes assumes. We often respond to the demands of the moment using simple rules of thumb.\nPrices, for instance, don’t matter too much (unless they’re exorbitant). This is because we just need to respond as best we can to what our bodies are telling us to do.\nThis is especially true of the decisions that contribute to the obesity epidemic.\nDEMAND FOR FOOD IS “INELASTIC”\nUniversity of Queensland, Roy Baumeister, has established that a phenomenon known as “ego depletion” erodes our willpower.\nDecisions about lunch or dinner come after long periods of difficult decisions at work or elsewhere. In this depleted state, we can become unable to control our impulses through rational thought about costs and benefits.\nFurther, food is not something we can substitute with an alternative – we must respond to the need for food. Economist Peter Earl has shown that such needs reduce the responsiveness of our simple rules of thumb to price, and thus to sin taxes. We simply grab what’s available as long as we can afford it.\nWhat this means is that when you’re tired and hungry after a long period of work, you (literally) can’t think about making or searching around for a nutritious meal, and you just need a\xa0burger.\nThese theoretical observations align pretty well with the data. For instance, three major studies in the past decade have found that the demand for food is “inelastic”.\nThis means a 1 per cent change in price will result in a less-than-1 per cent change in demand.\nAnother study on sugary drinks suggested the decrease in demand that occurs for these might correlate with an increased demand for alcohol.\n\n\nINNOVATION MAY BE A SOLUTION TO OBESITY\nGiven what we know about the responsiveness of demand for unhealthy food, researchers at the University of Georgia have argued sin taxes might be a poor way to respond to the obesity epidemic.\nThat obesity overwhelmingly affects the poorest means the effect of a sin tax would probably be to extract significant taxes from them without substantially changing their behaviour.\nBut given people likely don’t want to eat badly, more innovation may be the solution.\nSocial and political theorist, Jon Elster, has drawn on an idea from ancient mythology to develop the theory of “rational pre-commitment”.\nMuch like Odysseus tied himself to the mast of his ship to stop himself from falling for the deadly seduction of the Sirens, we can use technology to commit ourselves to eating a healthy lunch or dinner.\nThese technologies might be very simple (like setting a limit on your spending), or they may create “anchors” that stick out even in an ego-depleted state to make unhealthy choices really unpalatable.\nFor instance, Dan Ariely designed a scheme where people committed to forfeiting a 25 per cent discount on their groceries if they didn’t buy healthier foods. You might even (another Ariely idea) design an app that automatically donates money to something you hate unless you eat healthily.\n\n\nIf people really do worry about their inability to eat well, then behavioural economics suggests there’s a market for such technologies to emerge which will have the effect of reducing demand for unhealthy foods.\nOn the supply side too there’s a market for alternatives to the unhealthy foodstuffs we buy when we’re depleted and unable to make rational choices. Hard work isn’t going away, so people are going to need food that’s quick and cheap and easy for lunch and dinner.\nThere’s a gap in the market which the likes of fast food fills. Some attempts have been made already with “healthy” fast foods, but what’s needed is something that better competes with sugary and fatty alternatives.\nAlternatively, companies might even gain an edge in the job market were they to take responsibility for their workers’ health and bring back something of a cafeteria culture, with healthier foods provided free or at a nominal price.\nThe obesity epidemic is a significant challenge for our society. And behavioural economics shows us that levying sin taxes is unlikely to solve it without some perverse effects.\xa0\nBut it also points to great opportunity for entrepreneurship and innovation to fill not one but two gaps in our markets.\nWe need only some bright-eyed kids with a laptop, a willingness to innovate to solve a social problem, and some knowledge of behavioural economics.\nBrendan Markey-Towler is a researcher at the School of Economics at The University of Queensland.

      Is the 'king of fruit' set to conquer the Chinese market?
  </h1>, 'text': 'BEIJING:\xa0Fragrant to some,\xa0repulsive to others. China’s love for durian has skyrocketed in recent years, and the ""king of fruit""\xa0is now used to flavour products from yoghurt to cheese and coffee.\nBut while the import market in the country\xa0is currently dominated by Thailand, Malaysia also wants a slice of the pie.\n\n\nHe Guofei, 27, who runs a fruit shop in a residential neighbourhood in Beijing, told Channel NewsAsia he is\xa0not a big fan of durian - but that this has\xa0not\xa0stopped him from learning how to pick out a good-quality one based on just its smell.\nThe sheer volume of durian\xa0sales -\xa0three cartons every day - means he has no choice but to get up close to the thorny fruit.\n“When a good batch of durians arrives, we will send out a message on WeChat telling customers we have new stock and ask if they would like some and we can deliver it to them,"" said He.\nBut it is not just the whole fruit itself that the Chinese want to get their hands on.\nThere has\xa0been an increasing number of shops selling durian-related food items in Beijing in recent years.\nSimon Sun, who has a job in IT, opened one such shop in the city\'s central business district about a year ago, when he saw the potential of the Chinese market.\nSelling novelty items like roasted durian, durian egg tarts and even durian cheese, he said sales have taken off and the shop has become a bit of an\xa0Internet hit.\nHe said he uses mainly durians from Thailand, which make up the bulk of durians that China imports.\nWhole fresh durians from Malaysia are\xa0locked out of the Chinese market for now because of the risk of pests being transported along with the fruit. Only durians in pulp, frozen or chilled form are allowed.\nHowever, businesses said\xa0there are ways to get the frozen whole fruit into the country via other cities.\nMalaysian politicians, however, continue to seek official access for their durian exports to China because of\xa0soaring demand.\nIf durian diplomacy prevails, approval for whole-fruit imports from Malaysia could happen within a year.\n“If this really happens, I will run faster than a rabbit,"" said Sun, who added that he is already making preparations.\xa0\nThe 35-year-old told Channel NewsAsia that while his current shop may be a franchise, he intends\xa0to give it\xa0up after starting his own company and brand last month.\n""Our focus is similarly on durians and its related products, as well as other fruit\xa0from Southeast Asia,"" said Sun.\n""We are looking into partnerships with supermarkets, housing estates and online apps as well.”\n\n\nMore Malaysian imports could mean durian prices falling in China.\nCurrently,\xa0the Malaysian variety\xa0could come with a hefty price tag. Sun told Channel NewsAsia that customers have paid up to US$150\xa0for a frozen whole Mao Shan Wang durian weighing about 1.5kg.\nBy comparison, a Thai durian could cost around US$45.\n“Durian has a unique taste and it’s very rich. After eating it, you kind of crave it,” said Chinese national Yang Yang, who added that she is willing to pay to feed her durian indulgence.\n“I have durian about once a week. I would often buy a large durian and can finish it in two days,” added 25-year-old Roxanne Zhou.\xa0\nThe spike in popularity of durians could partly be due to more Chinese nationals travelling to Southeast Asia, according to\xa0Tan Heng Hong, APAC food and drink analyst at market research firm Mintel.\xa0\nHowever he noted that besides the durian, other distinctively Southeast Asian products could potentially\xa0also end up making huge waves in the world’s second-largest economy.\n“When you visit a country, you probably will have developed a taste for the local food, so when you go home you start to yearn for snacks and drinks that you have tasted abroad,"" said Tan.\n""We see that a lot of businesses are catering to this market at the moment.”\nHe stressed, however, there are still vast challenges.\nFor example, onerous Chinese regulations and the language barrier are all obstacles that businesses need to overcome, before Southeast Asian products can become king in China.\n', 'related_topics': ['     China ', '     trade ', '     Southeast Asia ', '     food ', '     Travel ']}"

      Ensuring the elderly eat enough: The health implications of a better diet
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: Madam Lim Siew Heng was 38kg at her heaviest, underweight even for her\xa0petite 1.55m frame. In recent years, her weight dropped to below 30kg. Now aged 94, Mdm Lim was probably\xa0undernourished.\nHer granddaughter Candy Quek, 26, told Channel NewsAsia that dietitians would always advise Mdm Lim to eat better, and that her family would try to feed her nutritional drinks. However, Mdm Lim had a small appetite and would reject such offerings.\nThings changed two years ago after a fall that resulted in a pelvic fracture. She became bedridden as a result. “There was an urgent need for her pelvis to recover. We didn’t want her to be bed-bound,” Ms Quek said.\nAt this point, Mdm Lim started actively taking nutritional drinks\xa0and eating more. This worked wonders, Ms Quek said. Mdm Lim recovered and is able to walk, although she prefers getting some assistance for fear of falling again. She now has phases where she eats the same food in small portions for a period of time. Some of her favourites have been french fries, beancurd and kaya toast. Her weight has gradually been increasing.\nA study aimed at finding healthcare solutions for undernourished elderly like Mdm Lim was launched in August this year. By identifying and fixing the problem early, researchers expect\xa0the average length of an elderly person's hospital stay to be cut down by 15 per cent, and hospital re-admission within three months to reduce by 5 per cent.\nThe three-year study, being conducted by Changi General Hospital and SingHealth Polyclinics in collaboration with healthcare firm Abbott, will investigate the effects of nutrition management on community-dwelling elderly in Singapore.\xa0The study will recruit 1,200 people aged 65 and above until\xa0May 2019 to investigate the role of nutrition in improving health outcomes, reducing hospital re-admission rate and length of stay among elderly with nutritional deficiencies.\nREFERENCE CENTRE TO BE BUILT AT CGH\nThe study will be the first project conducted at the Nutritional Health for the Elderly Reference Centre within CGH's Integrated Building. It\xa0aims to establish an Asia-centric reference database on elderly nutrition by using a predictive algorithm to identify elderly at risk of undernutrition in the community. This will help to increase nutrition literacy by 30 per cent and develop an oral nutrition supplement suited for Asians.\nAssociate Professor Ng Tze Pin, research director in the department of Psychological Medicine at Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine at the National University of Singapore, said the involvement of SingHealth polyclinics in this new interventional study is significant.\n“It means elderly nutrition is now being given due attention for the first time in government primary care polyclinics. I see an important role of primary care polyclinic doctors and nurses in screening for malnutrition using simple questionnaire tools,” said Prof Ng, who was among three researchers who published the first study documenting the high prevalence of undernutrition among Singapore's old folk in 2007.\nMalnutrition among the elderly has been on the radar of researchers, policy makers and clinical practitioners in North America, Europe and Japan for more than three decades, he said.\xa0\nOn the timing of the study, Dr Samuel Chew, senior consultant in the Department of Geriatric Medicine\xa0at CGH, pointed to the rapidly ageing Singapore population, where one\xa0in four\xa0will be above 65 by 2030.\nTHERE’S A NEED FOR STUDY: EXPERTS\nMalnutrition, a risk for 30 per cent of community-dwelling\xa0people aged 55 years and older, is a serious health issue, said Prof Ng. “Numerous studies show that malnutrition leads to increased severity of disease and disability, length of hospitalisation stay and healthcare costs, poor quality of life and increased mortality,” Prof Ng said.\n“It is a paradox of the present time that while we are relentlessly combating obesity and diabetes, undernutrition among the elderly has been under the radar for a long time. It is good that a new study now focuses attention again on this under-recognised and under-managed problem,” Prof Ng added.\nDr Chew said there is a pressing need for a change in paradigm from healthcare to health, and from investigations and treatments to prevention.\n“Nutrition plays a key role in improving the quality of life of this particular vulnerable cohort of our population by enabling functional optimisation and independent living for as long as possible,” he said.\nA study focusing on Asia is also timely, as current data and evidence on the importance of nutrition in improving the health of elderly people come from\xa0Western populations, said Dr Low Yen Ling, director of research and development at Abbott Nutrition Asia-Pacific Centre. It will help develop solutions that are customised to the Asian context, she said.\n“By prioritising nutrition care in the hospitals and ensuring that people are well-nourished, we remove a barrier to successfully managing chronic conditions while lowering the financial burden on individuals and the healthcare system at large,” she added.\nWHY THE ELDERLY MAY NOT BE EATING RIGHT\nUndernutrition is not an inevitable side effect of ageing, but many changes associated with the process of ageing can cause poor nutrition, said Dr Chew. For example, ageing is frequently associated with decreases in taste acuity and smell, deteriorating dental health, and decreases in physical activity, which may all affect nutrient intake, he said.\nMs Eleanor Yap, who has been working with the elderly for more than 10 years and manages an e-magazine for seniors, said that the issue is not as straightforward as it might seem. She gave an example of an older adult who may be eating less due to depression, having suffered grief, failing health, lack of mobility and other factors. If an older adult is living alone, he or she may not be able to afford to full meals every day, she said.\nDr Low said that unlike in less developed countries where malnutrition is mainly due to monetary constraints, causes in developed nations are mainly related to underlying disease, hospitalisation, or inability to eat properly due to factors such as poor appetite, swallowing difficulty, depression\xa0and social isolation.\n“Yet often it is left undiagnosed or untreated. However, we know that with screening, early identification and intervention, it is a largely preventable and treatable condition,” she said.\nWHAT ARE THE SIGNS AND WHAT SHOULD FAMILIES DO?\nThe experts urged families to look out for unexpected weight loss of 5 to 10 per cent over six months, loose clothing or jewellery and new-found difficulty in getting up from a sitting position, unsteadiness of walking gait, and recurrent falls.\nOther common symptoms of undernutrition include tiredness, fatigue, or apathy, longer healing times for wounds, loss of fat, reduced muscle mass and reduced tissue mass.\nGood nutrition and a balanced diet, which include\xa0adequate calorie and protein to help maintain\xa0body weight and a healthy Body Mass Index, therefore\xa0reducing\xa0risk of muscle loss and strength, are important, said Dr Chew.\xa0Suitable foods are carbohydrate foods like brown rice, noodles, bread, potatoes, oats and other wholegrain cereals, protein foods like fish, chicken, meat, eggs, milk, cheese, tofu and beans, he said.\xa0\nHowever, if there is any problem with eating adequately, a fortified drink or oral nutrition supplement may be necessary, Dr Chew added.\nResearch shows that eating meals with others enhances dietary variety and nutrient intake. Meals eaten in groups are up to 46 per cent larger than meals eaten alone, and that the more people there are at the meal, the greater the intake, he said.\nDr Low said that most people who are malnourished do not even realise it as it can be invisible to the eye, and it often goes undiagnosed.\xa0\n“Routine screening and early identification is critical to identify and implement nutrition interventions in order to prevent or treat malnutrition so people can live healthier lives and carry on doing the things they love,” she said.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     food ', '     health ']}"

      Commentary: Why are we willing to pay S$20 for a bowl of ramen but not bak chor mee?
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Earlier this month, Singapore’s Hill Street Tai Wah Bak Chor Mee emerged first in the annual Top 50 World Street Food Masters list, making it the second time the hawker has been lauded internationally; it was one of two hawkers here to be awarded a Michelin Star earlier.\nOut of the top 50 in the World Street Food Masters list, 14 were Singapore hawkers. It says something about the high standards of our hawker fare in Singapore.\nYet, Singaporeans are a spoilt lot when it comes to food, and the people we take most for granted are hawkers.\nWE EAT A LOT OF HAWKER FOOD\nA 2015 survey of eight cities conducted by IKEA the furniture store found that Singaporeans did the least home cooking. Out of 1,271 Singaporean households, only 22 per cent cooked every day, compared to about 49 per cent in London, Paris and Shanghai, and 54 per cent in Stockholm.\nThis is probably because most Singaporeans eat at hawker centres. Eighty-one per cent chose to eat at hawker centres when not at home, according to a 2014 survey by Weber Shandwick.\xa0\nYet, we are very receptive to foreign food. When asked if Singaporeans would welcome a new exotic ingredient from a foreign country, 44 per cent said yes, but were confident that this would not impact local food culture. Forty-three per cent said the foreign ingredient would be absorbed into and become local food culture.\nEither way, the Singaporean is blase: 86 per cent believe that cheap and authentic food will always be available in Singapore. This explains why we will pay S$20 for a bowl of ramen but will scream “murder” if a bowl of bak chor mee costs more than S$5.\nABUNDANCE DRIVES PRICES DOWN?\nSingaporeans are very proud of our Singapore food. In September 2009, then Malaysian Tourism Minister Dr Ng Yen Yen said that chilli crab and Hainanese chicken rice were Malaysian but had been hijacked by another country. A food fight erupted on the Internet.\nNo one pelted anybody with rotten tomatoes, but Singapore food experts including K F Seetoh of Makansutra and restaurateur Violet Oon had to be called in to mollify frayed tempers.\nSo there is fierce loyalty and ownership, no doubt, but this has resulted in a perverse response: “Why should we pay for what is ours?”\nAnother problem is the ubiquity of our Singapore food. It would not be Singapore food if it cannot be found everywhere in Singapore.\nMarry two economic ideas: The economics of abundance with the scarcity principle and you and I know without the economists having to tell us so, plenty of the same drives down prices. Less is best, so you need to play hard-to-get to get noticed.\nA major stumbling block with that argument is that our palates have become undiscerning. My father would not eat fried Hokkien mee unless it was from the Upper Serangoon Road stall at the junction of Lavender street, and no bak kut teh would pass his lips but the pork ribs soup from the now defunct Ellenborough Market.\nYet, Singaporeans today would not know gourmet Singapore even if you shoved their faces into the food. They do not see that top class char kway teow has to be fried individually, plate by plate, and yes with lard. They do not see that there may be an argument for paying “ramen prices” for a heavenly offering - the individual kway teow noodles almost melting one into one another - fried with the passion and strength of an Olympic breaststroke champion.\nWhen I was little, we had favourite foods that we called “opium”. “Aiyoh, got to have my opium today, if not die,” was an often-heard phrase.\xa0\nIf you will not travel from one end of Singapore to another for that one and only nasi lemak, expect to eat an undistinguished lump of rice with a fried sausage, slice of Maling luncheon meat and a sunny-side up egg where the yolk is no longer runny.\nA WARNING TALE: THE TING TING MAN\nHow many of you have eaten the candy from the ""ting ting man""? This was the nomadic vendor who walked around with a large tray of the sweet on his head and a folded wooden frame on one shoulder.\nStop him and he would open the frame and set the tray on it. Then with a hammer and chisel, he would chip pieces of halva-like candy with a chirpy “ting ting ting”. The ingredients were cheap - sugar and maltose - but the preparation was arduous. The sugars had to be cooked to somewhere between a soft and a firm stage, then pulled until white and chewy.\nYet, we refused to pay more than 10 cents for a serving so the poor hawker could not afford to settle in a stall and got chased off the roads by the health inspectors. One Singaporean food, dead as a dodo.\nBy the way, across the Causeway, there remain a few ting ting men who are venerated as national treasures, the custodians of Malaysia’s intangible heritage.\nMargaret Chan is Associate Professor of Theatre and Performance Studies (Practice) at Singapore Management University’s School of Social Sciences.

      3 reasons you should stop counting calories
  </h1>, 'text': 'Your diet is imperative\xa0when it comes to achieving your body goals — be it losing fat or building muscle — but counting calories is definitely not the way to go about controlling what you eat.\nBasing your food choices on caloric content isn’t just tedious, doing it can also be counterproductive to your health and fitness efforts. Below, we break down the reasons why you should stop counting calories, and what you should be doing instead!\n1. Math is tiring\nA big reason why most of us can’t stand counting calories is the amount work and math it takes to log down every single thing we put in our tummies. When you take into account the fact that calorie counting doesn’t even work as you read on, that amount of work suddenly seems even more pointless.\n2. Calories aren’t created equal\nLet’s say a bag of chips and an apple both contain 100 kcal — does that make both food items equally good for you? Of course not.\xa0\nTherein lies the biggest flaw in calorie counting: Not all calories are created equal.\xa0\nThere are many low-calorie foods that aren’t necessarily good for you, and there are also plenty of wholesome, healthy foods you should be eating that are high in calories. This is especially so for high-fat foods.\xa0\nFat largely contributes to a food’s caloric content, and natural produce like avocados, fish, nuts and eggs contain substantial amounts of (good) fat and therefore, calories. A diet based on calorie counting would mean avoiding food like these but you shouldn’t because they contain essential nutrients that your body needs to function.\xa0\n3. Labels aren’t completely accurate\nYou read that right. In Singapore, food manufacturers and distributors are allowed a variance of up to 20% between the declared nutritional value and the food’s actual nutritional value.\nIf everything you ate that day has 20% more calories than stipulated, that means you’d be eating 400 kcal more than the recommended 2000kcal a day for females — how’s that for counterproductive?\xa0\nWhat to do instead\nNow that we’ve established calorie counting isn’t the best way to go about managing your diet, here’s what you should do instead:\n1. Be mindful when you eat\nIn our busy, modern world, we tend to multitask all the time. However, when it comes to dining, sit down and take the time to focus all your attention on your food. Being mindful of your meals allows you to be clearer about when you’re really full and keeps you aware of what you’re putting into your body.\n2. Go natural & nutritious\nInstead of measuring your day’s meals by their calorie count, make it a point to make most of your meals with natural, nutrient-rich food. This way, you ensure you’re feeding your body with everything it needs to not just function, but help you work towards your body goals.\n3. Listen to your body\nBesides being mindful of what you eat, pay attention to your body as well. Listening to your body allows you to better understand when you’re really hungry or when you’re having an emotion-fuelled craving, and can even alert you to certain food groups you may be lacking in your diet. Having control over your body is half the battle won when it comes to a healthier diet.\n', 'related_topics': ['     food ', '     Singapore ']}"

      Evolving food courts: Blending hawker fare and hipster cafe
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: \'Hello You Foodie\' screams a brightly lit, partly-neon sign at diners, who are also greeted by designer lights and retro tiles.\nCustomers might be fooled into thinking that they are walking into a chic, new cafe. Instead, the snazzy interior is in a food court operated by Food Republic. Other food court chains like NTUC Foodfare and Kopitiam feature similar designer fittings and bright colours.\xa0\nWhile food courts were once generally positioned as a simple dining option offering basic dishes, they are increasingly taking on a more sophisticated identity. They were a step up from hawker centres and coffee shops, but in recent years, the gap has widened as many food courts have raised their technology, decor and offerings by several notches.\xa0\nFood Republic, which manages 15 food courts, has outlets with different themes. For example, Vivocity has a 1900s village theme while the Wisma Atria outlet is modelled to resemble a Singapore food street of the 1960s. Food court chain NTUC Foodfare also has themed outlets among its 13 food courts. Its Kallang Wave Mall outlet has a sports theme, while its Khoo Teck Puat Hospital outlet has a scenic garden concept.\nKopitiam, which operates more than 50 food courts, said it has themed outlets such as Gourmet Heritage in Bedok, and the upcoming KopiTech in the new Funan.\n“Food court decor has become more sophisticated over the years, to meet rising customers’ expectations on what a food court ... should look and feel like,” a Kopitiam spokesman said.\nSuch efforts to spruce up food courts have not gone unnoticed.\xa0\nFOOD COURTS ARE BRIGHTER, CLEANER\nHousewife Jasmine Chan, 49, eats at food courts three to four times a week. Speaking to Channel NewsAsia outside the Kopitiam outlet at Plaza Singapura after having a vegetarian meal that cost S$4.80, she said: “I find the lighting brighter now, and that does make the place look better and cleaner. There’s also more variety here than in coffee shops, and I find food here affordable.”\nRetired couple Mr A.S Chia, 70, and Mrs Irene Chia, 60, have started to spend more of their spare time at food courts. When Channel NewsAsia visited the Food Republic outlet in 313@Somerset at about 4pm on a Thursday, Mr Chia was reading the newspapers while his wife sipped on a drink.\xa0\n“This is one of my favourite food courts. It’s quiet, especially at this time,” said Mrs Chia.\n“There’s no rush for me to leave. If I was at a restaurant or a coffee shop, I couldn\'t just sit there,” Mr Chia chimed in.\nOther than the space to take a break, Mrs Chia said she also enjoyed her meal from a Japanese store. The couple said that food courts have “improved amazingly” over the years and find that they are an affordable place to dine at and pass time.\nHaving said that, Mrs Chia also pointed out that prices are sometimes high, with her meal from a Japanese stall costing S$7. However, she said that the air conditioning and the ambience made it worth the price.\nUSING TECHNOLOGY TO EASE MANPOWER SHORTAGE, PROVIDE CONVENIENCE\xa0\nAs well as innovative decor, food courts have been introducing new technologies to make things easier for themselves and patrons. Food Republic has implemented contactless and mobile payment options. These give greater convenience to customers, especially tourists and working professionals, as they need not fumble with cash, its general manager Andy Kiu said.\nSelf-ordering and self-payment systems in Straits Food Village at Changi Airport Terminal 2 helped overcome a shortage in manpower, said Mr Vincent Tan, managing director of Select Group which runs the food court. Kopitiam customers can also skip the queue by ordering their drinks and breakfast sets via self-order kiosks introduced in 2016. The chain has also taken technology one step further by launching mobile payment app K-pay in May this year. The app offers patrons a 10 per cent discount off food and beverage items.\nMr Tan from Select Group said that at Tanglin Food Hall, a 40-metre conveyor belt transports used plates from the collection point to the washing area, eliminating the need to manually do the task. A similar system is used in Kopitiam, a spokesman said. At Kopitiam, robotic vacuum cleaners are also used to clean and sanitise floors, decreasing man-hours by at least half.\xa0\n“High rental and shortage of manpower will continue to challenge the industry and we will have to overcome with innovation ideas and enhanced productivity,” Mr Tan said.\xa0\nMORE VARIETY, MORE INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS\xa0\nThe evolution of food courts also extends to their core offerings, with a much greater range of cuisines on offer. Whatever their mood, food court patrons are likely to find something that suits their palate.\xa0Food court chains now sell everything from Korean to Vietnamese to Mexican cuisine, a far cry from the focus on local dishes that used to be prevalent.\xa0\nEddie Lim, the director of Li Xin TeoChew Fishball Noodles who opened his stall in 2009 at Food Republic, said that 10 years ago, food courts focused on serving good quality food local hawker fare, and nothing “particularly adventurous”.\xa0\n“Over the years, local food court fare has diversified, featuring more international cuisine selections. Besides the usual local dishes, such as fishball noodles and Hokkien mee, we’re beginning to see more innovative Japanese, Korean and Thai cuisine available in food courts at an affordable prices,” he said. \xa0\nWhile most meals at food courts can still be bought for less than S$10, NTUC Foodfare has gone to extra lengths to keep prices affordable. “Stallholders who wish to operate in our food courts and coffee shops are required to submit their food prices for our review. We will then evaluate them against the mode price of the same food type sold at other similar food courts to ensure that the prices are not unreasonable and remain affordable,” a spokesman said.\xa0\nTo add to an already large array of cuisines, some food courts also lease out their space to restaurants within their premises, and they come with their own sitting areas. Popular food chains like Pepper Lunch and Monster Curry also have outlets in food courts.\nWith more payment options and offerings to cater to all palates, food courts are seeing a growth in foreign customers.\xa0\n“Our efforts to provide customers with a seamless dining experience have attracted a growing number of international visitors, and acquired us a CTRIP Food Award 2016/2017 and a TripAdvisor Certificate of Excellence,” Mr Kiu from Food Republic said. Similarly, Select Group’s Mr Tan said that there is an increase in the number of expatriates and tourists visiting his eight food courts.\xa0\nFOOD COURTS HERE TO STAY: ACADEMICS\nIn 1985, the first food court, Picnic, was established at Scotts Shopping Centre along Scotts Road. It was considered revolutionary, as it offered affordable hawker fare in a comfortable, air-conditioned environment, and became wildly popular.\nThis prompted the establishment of more food courts in shopping malls, housing estates and industrial parks. As early as 1998, Kopitiam experimented with themed food courts, with a jungle-themed food court at Plaza Singapura.\xa0\nFood courts are now an integral part of Singapore\'s F&B ecosystem, and academics said that they are here to stay.\n“They have allowed hard-working entrepreneurs to preserve and serve their traditional recipes. Also, they serve as an informal gathering place that helps build a strong sense of community,” said Visiting Professor Sherri Kimes from the Department of Decision Sciences, National University of Singapore Business School.\xa0\n“With their variety and affordability, food courts will continue to be a mainstay on Singapore’s culinary landscape. Dining at food courts has become a way of life in Singapore, hence there is reason to believe that food courts will continue to thrive amidst future economic uncertainty,” said Dr Denis Ang, Course Manager of Diploma in Food & Beverage Business at Nanyang Polytechnic.\nRetiree John Tan, 69, for one, is pleased that food courts are here to stay. ""Some of these food courts are top of the range, but still, they cater to people with various budgets,"" said\xa0Mr Tan, who was taking a respite from the sun at Food Republic\'s Bras Basah outlet.\n""The ambience is better here than in a coffee shop, and the quality of food is also comparable.""\n', 'related_topics': ['     food ']}"

      Pho no! Hunting in Hanoi for the best wanton noodles
  </h1>, 'text': 'HANOI: For many first-time visitors to Hanoi, their food excursion in this fast-changing city usually includes pho (beef or chicken noodle) and bun cha (vermicelli and grilled chopped meat).\nBut as many local and long-time residents know, this 1,000-year-old-city has many other culinary delights to offer other than these two popular dishes.\nTop of many lists when the hunger pangs hit is a wonton noodle soup stall - My Gia Cho Lon 1960 - on Trieu Viet Vuong street.\nWith a base in Ho Chi Minh City, the noodle stall first opened in Hanoi back in 2001. Duong Thanh Tung, 35, took over the food shop three years ago.\nIt offers 10 special homemade Chinese-style noodle dishes, from noodle soup with grilled pork to noodle soup with stewed duck and Chinese herbs.\nThe most popular item here, however, is the wonton noodle soup which costs about 40,000 VND (US$1.76). The noodles are homemade but what really brings the customers back is the broth - a fresh, light and delicate soup with no MSG.\nThe stock is made from scratch using a secret family recipe that has been handed down for generations. When served with the springy noodle, crispy wanton and tender char siu, the flavour of the broth is enhanced and is certainly well worth the wait.\nTung says the recipe dates as far back as the 1920s and that the shop’s wanton noodle soup is a “combination of China’s Guangdong and Fujian noodle styles, adapted to Vietnamese local taste.”\nAccording to food historian Erica Peters, Vietnam has had a significant Chinese trading community since at least the 17th century. As they fled China’s southern regions of Guangdong and Fujian after the Manchus overthrew the Ming dynasty, the Chinese brought with them their cuisine to Vietnam, including lao huo zhou (slow-cooked stew), tan mien (noodle soup), and wanton soup, which evolved into Vietnamese soups such as lau (hot pot) and hu tieu (noodle soup with pork, shrimp, and bean sprouts).\nTung is fifth-generation Vietnamese. His family came from Fujian, China and they sold Chinese traditional medicines in Central Vietnam to make a living. But the medicine trade was forced to shut down in the 1920s as trading routes to China, where they sourced their merchandise, was cut off. That marked the start of the noodle business.\nWhat really sets Tung’s business apart from the rest, besides the secret recipe, is his sunny disposition. Tung greets every customer with a smile, sharing with them how best to enjoy his noodles.\n“You might want to mix the noodle up to get the best taste, because the main sauce is at the bottom of the bowl,” he said with a smile. “It goes well with soy sauce too,” he added, before calling out to a busboy to get a new serving of soy sauce.\nAs another group of customers arrived, he went out to the door and greeted them by name.\n“Most of our customers are regulars and I know many of them now,” he said. “Once a customer tries our food, there is a good chance he or she will come back.”\nMy Gia Cho Lon 1960 is located at 115 Trieu Viet Vuong Street. Opening hours: 7am-2pm; 5.30pm-10pm, daily.\n', 'related_topics': ['     food ', '     Hanoi ']}"

      ASIA'S FUTURE CITIES: High-speed rail on track to connect Vientiane to the region
  </h1>, 'text': 'VIENTIANE: On the outskirts of the Lao capital, a blue passenger train rattles from its station and across a dry landscape.\nReverberating sirens ring out as boom gates block a nearby road, a handful of motorcyclists almost bemused by the misfortune of being made to wait.\nThis is the only operating railway in the entire country.\nThe connector with Thailand spans just 3.5km of Laos itself before crossing the Mekong river on the Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge and towards Nong Khai.\nBut if China’s ambitious plans are realised, within five years, Laos could have hundreds of kilometres of high-speed rail line connecting its capital to the southern China border and the strategic city of Kunming.\nThe construction of the 414km project got off to a symbolic start last December, with a ground-breaking ceremony in the north of the country. It followed previous stalled attempts to begin construction and a decade of negotiations. \nFor Beijing it means its aspirations to link its mainland with Southeast Asia, all the way down to Singapore, will be a step closer to reality. The Chinese want southern access to the sea as part of its One Belt, One Road initiative.\nBut for Vientiane, a pit stop on this ambitious pathway, the impact could be profound. An already fast-growing city, the leap towards full connectivity with the region will come faster than most Laotians might have imagined.\nNow, with a physical infrastructure connection to the world’s biggest population coming, it is the land links that Vientiane wants to seize upon.\n“Previously we had been talking about the disadvantage of the geographic location of the country. But we are seeing this disadvantage turn into an advantage,” said Dr Leeber Leebouapao from the National Institute of Economic Research, a key policy advisor to the central government.\nWith the agreed-upon Vientiane-Hanoi highway also in the mid-term pipeline, Dr Leeber said he expected the capital to be “booming” as the central point between China and the region’s other hubs.\n“After the railway and highway are completed, connectivity will be facilitating more economic relations, more flow of people and money. Flowing in and out. It is a new phenomenon here,” Dr Leeber said.\n“This will become a trade centre for investors, factories, banks. Things will change very fast.”\n“Will the train help Laos by helping create economic opportunities in the context of it being a land-linked country? Definitely,” said Stephen Schipani, the officer in charge of the ADB-Lao PDR Resident Mission.\n“I always say ‘does Laos have access to the sea?’ And people look at you funny because they know Laos doesn’t have direct access to the sea. But in fact it does. It has access to a sea of people.”\nThat sea could bring new waves of visitors, including millions of tourists from southern China, as well as up to 100,000 overseas workers expected to be needed to complete the project, given Laos’ lack of expertise in the rail industry.\nIt could also bring new migration from abroad and domestically, as more people chase opportunities in the capital.\nVientiane is expected to see an increase of population of more than 50 per cent in the next decade, swelling it from a sleepy riverside city into, possibly, a strategic axis for trade and growth.\n“There are opportunities for value-added food, niche agricultural produce and organic crops are a big potential advantage,” Schipani said. “Scheduled train services can move that produce across borders.”\nThe proposed fast train will travel at 160kmh, reducing travel time from Vientiane to Kunming to just 10 hours.\nBut the true value of the project may only be realised if and when Laos’ southern counterparts complete their own segments of the railway, at the behest of Beijing. Negotiations about sections elsewhere are ongoing.\n“We are just a small country and there is a big market in China,” Dr Leeber said. “The question is how to take advantage of the opportunity. If we don’t, someone else will.”\nFollow Jack Board on Twitter: @JackBoardCNA \n', 'related_topics': ['     food ', '     Malaysia ', '     Southeast Asia ', '     officer ', '     Singapore ']}"

      Heritage and gentrification: Is there a win-win for neighbourhoods?
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: When Ms Hidayah Amin walks around her old neighbourhood of Kampong Glam, she does not hide her disappointment. To her, it “has no spirit anymore”.\n“Last time, this used to be a residential area. Today, it is just very sanitised and commercialised … the whole place is just for tourists,” she told the programme Talking Point.\nThe former resident feels that despite conservation efforts since 1989 to preserve Kampong Glam’s heritage, the gentrification of the neighbourhood, with its rows of restaurants, fashion boutiques and hipster cafes, has changed the area’s identity.\nPointing to transplanted palm trees, Ms Hidayah said: “It is a very Arabised landscape.”\n“There were a lot of races who lived here, but there were also a lot of Malays who, like my family, were here since the 1850s,” she added.\nKampung Glam - which is thought to be named after the ""gelam"" or cajeput tree - was settled in the 1800s by Malays and other Muslim immigrants from the region, as well as some Arab traders. Today, Ms Hidayah, claims, there is little in the landscape that is “Malay” anymore.\nWATCH: A former resident and current retailers’ views about Kampung Glam (2:24)\nElsewhere too in Singapore, from Chinatown to Tiong Bahru, the “gentrification” of old heritage districts has fuelled concern over whether it leads to the death of a neighbourhood’s authentic identity. (Watch the Talking Point episode here.)\nCan heritage and commercial development exist in harmony?\nGENTRIFICATION AND TENSION\nOne example of gentrification, according to Dr Yeo Kang Shua, is in Kreta Ayer, otherwise known as Chinatown, one of the top three destinations for tourists here.\n“The original use of the neighbourhood is no longer viable and the original residents living in that area have all moved out, and new users and functions have moved in, making the area quite different,” said the assistant professor of architectural history, theory and criticism at the Singapore University of Technology and Design.\nCommercial development in Kampong Glam has also seen its share of controversy and change. The sprouting of massage parlours, shisha cafes and pubs over the years was a source of concern to those like Ms Hidayah. But in 2005, changes to zoning rules for food and beverage establishments stemmed the setting up of new pubs and nightclubs.\nSaid Dr Yeo: “Today, you see gentrification especially in Bali Lane, where a lot of new boutiques, food and beverage (joints) have moved in … (so) there is bound to be tension.”\nMs Hidayah feels this tension, especially with the loss of her old neighbourhood’s history. While the buildings have been conserved and a heritage trail provides information about significant spots, the stories behind many of the old pre-war shop houses and those who used to live there are largely glossed over, she claims.\n“There is something interesting about each and every building. This is a hostel, and this is just another clothing store, but you do not link them with the real stories of these places,” said Ms Hidayah. She suggested, for instance, markers giving information about the families that used to live in each home - “someone who was a tailor lived here”, for example.\nDr Yeo said it is difficult to have a win-win situation when it comes to development and preservation. One exception so far has been Little India, which has managed to keep a balance between being a tourist destination and remaining relevant to locals.\nSTRIKING A BALANCE?\nTo avoid conflict, changes in neighbourhoods have to be gradual, said Dr Yeo.\n“Gentrification in the case of Chinatown tends to have a negative connotation. But gentrification which is controlled over a slow period of time injects life into an area where old users get phased out in the course of history.\n“So we need to find new users. The question is how fast we introduce them.”\nHe pointed to the Tiong Bahru neighbourhood, which once had a contentious surplus of hipster restaurants and cafes which residents claim had little relevance to their needs.\nMs Carolyn Oei, who has been living in the neighbourhood since 2009, pointed out how, for instance, “there is still only one provision shop left”. “At one point in time, people were complaining of hipster bistros and cafes. I mean, how many shops selling S$6 coffees do you need?” she said.\nBut she added that over time, residents have been proactive, asking for practical changes and commercial regulations in the neighbourhood to be implemented.\n“We still have the market, that’s good. Over the last three or four years, things have started to recalibrate,” said Ms Oei, who added that long-term residents are investing their time into maintaining a sense of vibrancy and creativity in their community through various projects.\nDr Yeo noted that stakeholders and developers, too, need come up with creative ideas to continue “a kind of social fabric” everyone wants to see.\nMODERNISATION AND CHANGE ARE NECESSARY\nBack in Kampong Glam, business owner Calvin Seah - co-founder of The Black Hole Group which operates food and beverage outlets and one hostel in the area - feels that the development that has taken place is part of the neighbourhood’s natural evolution to remain fresh and vibrant.\nSaid Mr Seah: “I think it (Kampong Glam) has modernised itself; there is no point keeping heritage for the sake of it until it becomes commercially irrelevant.""\n“We still have our traditional businesses and the new businesses to keep this area relevant and for people to come. If we all have just traditional businesses, then it becomes a fabricated place and we will lose out in relevance to society,"" he said.\nMs Jamie Koh, owner of The Beast Southern Kitchen and Bourbon Bar, agreed. “Crowds have come in. Not just the tourists but also the locals who might not necessarily visit the area otherwise, because it was known as a wholesale centre for fabrics.”\nMr Saeid Labbafi, who owns nine shops there and chairs the One Kampong Glam Association, said that businesses are conscious of the area’s heritage. “Many other historical places ... have lost their old trades or their businesses.\n“We are hoping that the remaining businesses which are in the area work towards conservation and their history.”\nTalking Point explores what it takes to authentically preserve Singapore’s heritage.

      Pets leave huge carbon 'paw-print' on planet, study shows
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Dogs, cats, hamsters, goldfish and other popular pets are not doing any better than human beings when it comes to preserving the environment, based on a study by New Zealand’s Victoria University of Wellington.\nThe research was carried out by professors at the School of Architecture and specialists of sustainable living, Brenda and Robert Vale, who analysed the ingredients of pet food to estimate common pets\' eco-footprint.\nTheir study – featured in science and technology news magazine New Scientist – compared the energy used in producing food for a Great Dane and that required for fuelling as well as building a 4.6-litre Toyota Land Cruiser that is driven 10,000km a year.\nThe result was, for many, astonishing.\n\nIn their book Time To Eat The Dog: The Real Guide To Sustainable Living, the Vales showed that owning a Great Dane can hurt the environment more than driving the SUV. Although their research gained huge international attention, it also attracted what the university described as “understandable hostility”.\n""The benefits of pets need to be viewed more holistically, rather than just through the prism of their \'carbon paw-print\',"" said Graham C Smith, CEO of UK-based natural pet food company Fish4Dogs.\n""Our environment, far from being threatened by pets, is greatly enriched by the part they play in our lives,"" he added.\nHowever, that did not stop the issue from being picked up again by environmentalists, as the global community celebrates World Environment Day on Friday (June 5).\n“The production of pet food includes intensive cattle farming, packaging, shipping process, storing places and distributing sacks and cans of pet food. Taking into account the 1 billion population of pets worldwide, all these different production stages seriously contribute to the increasing pollution of the world,” explained pet industry expert Zakaria Faiq, General Manager of Biogance.\n“The pets’ carbon footprint is a crucial topic that we should seriously take into account in the current context of global environmental concerns,” he added.\nUSE ECO-FRIENDLY PET FOOD\nEstablished in June 1972 by the United Nations’ General Assembly, World Environment Day serves as an international platform for countries worldwide to deepen environmental awareness and drive positive actions for nature.\nIn Singapore, Jun 5 also marks the local Eco Action Day – an annual nationwide campaign that strives to turn the Little Red Dot green through reduced energy and resource consumption.\nOn this day, residents of Singapore are encouraged to be ""particularly kind"" to their environment, with suggestions ranging from taking public transport instead of their own cars to replacing meat-base diet with greens.\nAs for pet lovers with a green heart, Mr Faiq suggested a simple way for them to reduce their carbon footprint.\n“Buy the right products, that is to say eco-friendly products, made with natural and organic ingredients, free of chemical molecules and also biodegradable,” he said.\nHe added that investing in natural and chemical-free grooming products and in biodegradable litters and poop bags will not only have “a considerable positive impact on the environment but also on our pet’s health and well-being”.\n“The manufacturers also have their part to play in this situation by modifying their methods of production that make too much waste and pollution.""\nIn Singapore, many pet owners are already using eco-friendly food and products, including Action for Singapore Dogs’ (ASD) adoption and rescue centre.\n“We feed our dogs Wellness Super 5 mix, which is organic dog food,” said Ms Wendy Low, Vice President of ASD – a network of volunteers helping stray and abandoned dogs find new homes through fostering and adoption programmes.\nAccording to Ms Low, ASD’s adoption and rescue centre is committed to green practices, and refuses to use harsh or toxic chemicals harmful to the environment to clean its kennels.\n“We also accept donations of used items such as toys, towels, collars, leashes, cages and even furniture which people want to discard, as well as medicine and food that are close to their sell-by date,” she added.\nADOPT PETS TO CUT CARBON PAW-PRINT\nIn Singapore, many pet owners such as Sally Doherty did not wait for the World Environment Day to go green.\n“We make our own food. So we use food that we’ve got in refrigerator and we make food rather than keep purchasing it,” said the Sentosa Island resident, who also advocates for pet adoption as a way to minimise carbon ‘paw-print’.\nBy adopting abandoned pets and neutering them, the owners help keep the animal’s population under control and limit the amount of energy required for their existence too, she said.\nHer view was echoed by ASD President Ricky Yeo.\n""Less strays on the streets mean that less resources are required to trap them, for example, the use of vans and lorries,"" he explained, adding there are currently about 8,000 stray dogs in Singapore.\nAccording to Mr Yeo, the pet population keeps growing every year, as people continue to buy them on impulse. “People still buy on impulse and as a reward for their children when they score good grades. The pet population is growing yearly, and as such, it is expected that there will be a higher number of abandoned pets.”\nTRAP, NEUTER, RETURN\nTo prevent pets from overpopulating and polluting the environment further, volunteers like Sally dedicate their personal time to help manage the pet population in their communities.\nOriginally from New Zealand, Sally is a cat lover and has been working with stray cats over the past three years.\n“When I moved here, there were a lot of stray cats living in the area. There were probably about 60 on Sentosa and the population kept increasing. Everywhere you looked, there would be a new litter of kittens being born,” she said.\n“So a group of us got together to trap them, neuter them and return them to new homes. Over the past three years, about 55 stray cats have been re-homed.”\nCurrently, the New Zealander has four rescued cats at home and runs a feeding-and-fostering programme for stray cats on the island, not to mention several puppies and their three-legged mother, abandoned by their previous owner. The pooches will remain under her care until someone offers them a new home.\n“Before deciding to own a pet, the first thing you need to consider is the responsibilities and commitment. See if you can maintain them on a long-term basis, said ASD\'s Yeo.\n""Having a dog is similar to having a child, and requires a strong head and heart to work out the issues along the way. Adoption is the best option, as there is a proper process to match the dog with the family, not to mention the post-adoption support.” \n', 'related_topics': ['     New Zealand ', '     food ', '     Singapore ']}"

      Nepal earthquake: Journey to the epicentre
  </h1>, 'text': 'BARPAK: The road to Barpak is a bone jarring one. For six hours northwest from Kathamandu, it winds deeper into Gorkha country, up steep mountains, over creeks and through impoverished villages. Dust whips at the wheels and windows of our 4x4 and before long even the cabin is choked with a film of earthy grime.\nAlong the way, there would be points when the road becomes impassable and local people rush to help push our vehicle out of deep, muddy ruts. We are headed to the mountains - the earthquake epicentre - but even by Nepal standards, this is a difficult place to get to.\nEventually the road runs out. It had been cut off at Baluwa - a village that is swarming with refugees from the hills who have come to shelter in the relative safety of the valley.\nA digger has made some progress clearing the sole path to the upper villages and towns, but multiple landslides of boulders means there will be no vehicle access for the foreseeable future.\nAlong with dozens of local people carrying heavy baskets strapped at their foreheads full of rice, water hygiene kits and even small babies, we begin the trek up. The path snakes past a river of growing rapids and across a wooden bridge with a worrying number of missing planks before it rises sharply up a sheer, slippery slope. Every step is uncertain and laboured. It remains like this for hours.\n\n\nEarthquake survivors begin the long walk from Baluwa to Barpak with aid baskets. (Photo: Jack Board)\nOur three-man news team is kitted out with cameras, lenses, a tripod, live broadcast equipment, food, water, medical supplies and a tent and tarpaulin. Sweat grips our faces and backs and there are many times I thought we won\'t make it as daylight fades.\nUtter destruction is clear as we climb higher. What was once the village of Mandre is now eerily deserted. Houses lay crumbled with former personal possessions dotted here and there - shoes, toys and broken furniture poke out of the forsaken rubble. The smell of rotting corpses, probably of animals, punches the mountain air at intervals. No one pauses to investigate.\n\n\nEarthquake damage at mountain village on Mandre. (Photo: Jack Board)\n \n\n\nEarthquake damage at mountain village on Mandre. One man carries a heavy load down the steep slope. (Photo: Jack Board)\nAs lightning illuminates the taller peaks ahead of us, where Barpak still lies, we abandon the path for the day, setting up camp in an abandoned home fortified by Australian Aid tarpaulins. It is welcome shelter from the midnight rains as we sit and eat canned fish and noodles. The silence is broken by an aftershock that lingers for just a couple of seconds. It is unsettling being on such broken ground as the earth rumbles.\n\n\nLocals carry aid packages up the slippery path to Barpak - the epicentre of the #NepalQuake - which is in need of supplies to prepare for the monsoon season. cna.asia/1E08uY4\nBy dawn, the track is busy with villagers rushing down to the valley to collect the next wave of food aids from international donors. Singapore, Australia and Canada have teams working to deliver relief. Some of the keener young locals actually run down the steep, broken stone steps, while others laden with large suitcases and boxes are forced to proceed with caution.\n\n\nNepalese who have left the mountain villages for safety in the valley.

(Photo: Jack Board)\nPrem, who was wearing a Singapore Police Force shirt, said his brother serves in the force, one of the many from here in the Gurkha contingent. He said more aid is badly needed in Barpak - the basics people here are used to like rice and lentils, not noodles and chocolate.\nSharp peaks with permanent snow caps emerge on the horizon and a mountain breeze cools our steps as we continue what seems an endless ascent. Finally out of the mist, elevated more than 2,000 metres is Barpak, as widespread destruction marks the spot.\nIt is here where the earthquake did its worst and, of the 1,200 homes, all but a handful are destroyed. Somehow it is still a beautiful place, sad but beautiful.\nThere is a constant tinkering throughout the town from locals attempting to disentangle the wreckage of their houses. There are piles of corrugated iron, broken bricks and splintered wood and many of the once tidy, narrow streets are difficult to pass through.\nLots of children with faces smeared with dirt are doing the work of adults, carrying large planks and stones that used to be part of their homes. They giggle and point at us as we walk by, the amusement of foreign strangers for youth still trumps the pile of devastation in front of them.\nManbahadur Gurung works in Bahrain as a construction worker to send money back to his family. The quake destroyed his small home and killed his wife. He wasn\'t here, and now he will never hold her again.\n\n\nManbahadur Gurung surveys his house in Barpak, where his wife was killed in the earthquake. (Photo: Jack Board) \n""I was thinking about my family that whole day, I didn\'t hear any news about my family,"" he said. ""When I contacted the police, then only I heard that my wife had died in the earthquake and my house had fallen down.""\n""The company where I was working, they didn\'t give me holiday time to come home. So I had to leave that job and pay for my own airfare back to Nepal,"" he said. ""I was totally shocked and I can\'t make any decisions for my family. I was going totally mad. Now I only live for my children\'s future.""\nA man calls out to us and asks to show us his new makeshift house. Tek Bahadur Ghale and his five brothers were neighbours, but now they are living under one roof - 24 in total in a shelter without proper walls or floor.\n\n\nA total of 24 family members live in this small shelter in Barpak after all their houses were destroyed. (Photo: Jack Board)\nHe said they expected to live there for at least the next six months. His father-in-law is unwell and the children are hungry and restless, but they consider themselves lucky that everybody survived. There are fresh graves marked by white stone on the hillside behind the town. There have been hundreds of new additions of late.\nMuch of the body retrieval process and medical treatment has been performed by members of the Indian Army stationed in Barpak since a few days after the quake. ""We came here initially for two or three days. We managed infected wounds, lacerations, contusions and lower limb fractures,"" said Dr Maj Sanjeev Malik from 60 Para Field Hospital, Agra.\n""All of the critical patients have been evacuated to Kathmandu. We are managing minor injury patients here. These people need food, shelter, fuel and restoration of transport, communications and power. In foods, particularly, they need cereals because these people have been getting biscuits, Maggi noodles, juice, which are not in their culture. What they require are cereals, rice for their household consumption,"" he said.\nLocals say they are pleased the Indians have helped them when others have not. They will leave soon though.\nThe tourist trade that helps stimulate its small economy may not return. Just one small guesthouse and restaurant is still open, albeit without power. \'I am providing food for the guests. But our reserved food is getting low and when it runs out, I am afraid for my family,"" said Min Gurung, the owner of Ruping \'La\' Guesthouse.\nThis village is a proud place full of strong people, but its foundations have been shaken. The path to survive has never been harder. \n', 'related_topics': ['     food ', '     Nepal ']}"
