      Meet-the-people sessions go hybrid: MPs adapt as engagement with residents shift online
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: While physical Meet-the-People sessions have mostly resumed, the way residents make their issues and concerns known has shifted online –\xa0with many more using online channels to reach out to their Members of Parliament.\nLast Tuesday (Jan 4), MP Jamus Lim (WP-Sengkang) wrote on Facebook that like many in Singapore\xa0who returned to their offices in the new year, the Workers’ Party resumed face-to-face ground activities last week.\nBut at his ward in Anchorvale, the Meet-the-People session (MPS) on Monday night was “scaled down”.\nLetter-writing volunteers continued to work remotely while a split team of core volunteers were there, with crowd control to separate waiting areas for vaccinated and unvaccinated residents.\n“Like many operations, we have also become very much hybrid in how we work,” said Associate Professor Lim.\xa0“Many residents now reach out to us electronically, providing sufficiently extensive details that we are able to assist them that way.”\nMPs CNA spoke to said that they’ve noticed the shift, which has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, along with the digitalisation of other aspects of life.\nAssoc Prof Lim said that while he\xa0has\xa0resumed\xa0face-to-face MPS every Monday, volunteers and many residents have become so adept at using online video conferencing tools such as Zoom that he has retained that option for MPS meetings.\nThis is useful in some cases where\xa0residents are unable to make it on Monday evenings, have an urgent case that cannot wait or are physically unable to travel to the session.\xa0\n“So like everyone else, we have learned how to weave in efficiencies into a hybrid format,” he told CNA, giving some examples of how he and the Anchorvale volunteers\xa0have adapted the virtual sessions over time to make them more efficient.\n“Like everyone else, we will evolve as the platform evolves.”\nMP Poh Li San (PAP-Sembawang) said she has not resumed face-to-face MPS and has\xa0been personally replying to emails from residents who need help. Some also contact her via Facebook Messenger.\nWhile most residents now use virtual modes to contact her, some who are not aware that face-to-face sessions have been suspended or those who are less tech-savvy still turn up for help.\xa0So every Wednesday evening, Ms Poh and a small team of volunteers head to her\xa0MPS office to attend to these residents, she said.\nMs Poh and other MPs interviewed said that residents now do not have to wait for the weekly sessions to reach them, don’t have to wait in line and responses can be faster for straightforward cases.\nMinister of State for Trade and Industry and for Culture, Community and Youth Alvin Tan (PAP-Tanjong Pagar) said that appeals and suggestions from residents come to him daily from many different channels. \xa0\n“I think we've had to adjust … MPS is not just MPS of old, where you know, you meet on Mondays or wherever day you designate, it’s really every day … It's almost quite relentless,” he said.\xa0\n“There is a boon and bane to being very available. You do inadvertently raise expectations.”\nMr Tan, who worked at multinational tech firms before joining politics, is one MP who has set up a large array of digital platforms from the now de rigueur Facebook page to a Telegram channel and a Tik Tok account.\nHe said that the primary channel residents use to contact him is email, and a significant amount of feedback also comes from WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Instagram direct messages.\n“I’m experimenting still, but I haven’t got an MPS type of appeal through Tik Tok,” he said.\nTo keep track of the cases, his team logs them on a cloud-based platform which also “pings” them if they have not responded to a certain case after some days, he said.\nDespite the conveniences, Ms Poh and Ms Foo Mee Har (PAP-West Coast) both said that they prefer physical meetings.\nSaid Ms Poh: “For physical sessions, we can comfort and interact with residents and speak with them, especially if their native language is not English.\xa0\n“Also, through the body language, we can better gauge if residents have other needs that they may not mention in emails or phone calls. Personally I still prefer physical sessions.”\nAll MPs said that if a case is complex, they would arrange a Zoom meeting, phone call or house visit to meet the resident. They also have skeletal crews manning their branch offices on MPS nights for residents who are not as tech-savvy.\nWhen COVID-19 safe management measures allow, Ms Foo said would like to go back to meeting residents in person at MPS. \xa0\n“Besides the warmth and assurance that we can provide residents when meeting physically, \xa0in-person meeting is most helpful for the more complex cases involving assistance that may be multi-faceted,” she said. \xa0\n“However, given the convenience of virtual channels for residents, we will explore continuing different formats.”\nOn the future of such hybrid forms of community engagement, Mr Tan said that different platforms have different users, so in the future, one would have to be quite mindful “what kind of content works on which platform” and also how the general public and constituents use the platforms to reach MPs.\nAssoc Prof Lim said that in many parts of the world, employees are now used to the work-from-home option, and social and community engagement is “no different”.\n“While we very much hope to be able to return to larger-scale weekend coffee sessions with residents and town hall meetings and constituency dinners, we also recognise that a subset of these –\xa0especially those where the nuances of a physical meeting are secondary compared to the content –\xa0could well go virtual,” he said.\n“I am thinking of, for instance, inviting international guest speakers to part of an event, or providing time-sensitive counseling to an individual in need.”\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Singapore politics ', '     Jamus Lim ', '     Foo Mee Har ', '     Poh Li San ', '     Alvin Tan ']}"

      Raeesah Khan stands by her evidence; psychiatrist says she did not have any disorder that would 'predispose' her to lying: COP report
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Former Workers\' Party (WP) Member of Parliament Raeesah Khan maintained\xa0that the party\'s leaders did not tell her to clarify a lie\xa0she had told in Parliament, according to a summary of further evidence she gave on Wednesday (Dec 22) to the\xa0Committee of Privileges (COP).\nThis is Ms Khan\'s\xa0second time appearing before the committee, which is looking into a complaint against her for lying in Parliament.\nShe admitted that she had lied in Parliament on Aug 3 about a\xa0sexual assault case, and had repeated the lie on Oct 4.\nOn Nov 1, Ms Khan admitted in Parliament that she had lied about accompanying a sexual assault victim to the police station because she was a survivor of a sexual assault. She also said she did not want to reveal that she had heard the anecdote in a support group.\nShe\xa0subsequently resigned as an MP and from the WP.\nWhen questioned by the COP on Dec 2, Ms Khan said that she had told WP leaders\xa0at a meeting on Aug 8 about the lie and was then told to ""retain the narrative"",\xa0which she took to mean that she should continue lying.\nShe also sent a text message on Aug 8 to two\xa0aides - Ms Loh Pei Ying and Mr Yudhisthra Nathan, telling them that WP leaders had told her to ""take the information to the grave"". Ms Loh and Mr Nathan had given\xa0evidence corroborating Ms Khan\'s account.\xa0\nBut WP chief Pritam Singh told the COP\xa0that this conversation did not take place, and that there had been no discussion during the meeting about whether or how to correct Ms Khan’s untruth.\nIn addition, he suggested to the COP that Ms Khan suffered from ""disassociation"" due to past trauma and asked that she undergo a psychiatric assessment.\nIn her testimony to the COP, WP chair Sylvia Lim\xa0also said that Ms Khan was ""doing things without thinking about what she was doing"".\nShe said that Ms Khan submitted documents to a WP disciplinary panel from a psychotherapist, with indications that\xa0Ms Khan\xa0was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)\xa0and that she is undergoing therapy.\nThe Office of the Clerk of Parliament said in a press release on Wednesday that the Committee\xa0invited Ms Khan to undergo a psychiatric assessment.\nShe agreed and saw Dr Christopher Cheok, acting chief and senior consultant at the\xa0department of forensic psychiatry at\xa0the\xa0Institute of Mental Health, on Dec 17 and Dec 20.\nResponding to the claims by Mr Singh and Ms Lim about her mental state,\xa0Ms Khan said that it was ""extremely out of line"" for them ""to have used mental illness as a means to discredit someone"", according to the summary.\n""Mr Singh had tried to paint a picture of her as someone who was mentally unstable, when she was of sound mind,"" said the report from the COP summarising the key points of Ms Khan\'s testimony.\nOn what happened at an Aug 8 meeting with\xa0Mr Singh, Ms Lim and Mr Faisal Manap, Ms Khan said that\xa0their evidence was untrue.\nAccording to her, the words “take it to the grave” were used by Mr Singh, in front of Ms Lim and Mr Faisal. She said that this was not a phrase she would ""ordinarily use"", the COP report said.\nShe added that there was no discussion during the meeting on whether she should disclose the sexual assault to her father and family, which Mr Singh claimed he had told her to do.\nMr Singh and Ms Khan had also given differing accounts of\xa0an Oct 3 meeting at her house, a day before the\xa0Parliament sitting where she repeated her lie when questioned by Home Affairs and Law Minister K Shanmugam.\nMs Khan had earlier told the COP that during this visit, Mr Singh told her that if she kept to her existing narrative, there would be ""no judgment"".\nBut Mr Singh said he told Ms Khan that “if the issue came up”, Ms Khan had “to take responsibility and ownership of the issue”, and if she did so, he “will not judge” her.\nMs Khan said that Mr Singh had\xa0never said the\xa0words “take ownership and responsibility”\xa0to her, nor did he tell her to clarify the lie in Parliament.\nOn the day of the Oct 4 Parliament sitting, Ms Khan\xa0sent Mr Singh a message, asking: “What should I do, Pritam?”.\nWhen asked about this, Ms Khan said that she was waiting for Mr Singh to respond to her message, to give her guidance about what she should do.\xa0As Mr Singh did not reply to her, she lied again.\nLater that night, sometime past 11pm, Ms Khan met Mr Singh and Ms Lim in the\xa0office of Leader of the Opposition.\nMr Singh\xa0previously said that Ms Khan was ""in a daze"" and had said:\xa0“Perhaps there is another way. That is, to tell the truth.”\nMs Khan agreed that she said those words,\xa0but disagreed that she had been ""in a daze"" when she said those words.\nMs Lim had said that\xa0Mr Singh responded by asking Ms Khan\xa0if she ""hadn’t already chosen a path"", the report said.\nMs Khan\xa0testified that she\xa0was ""shocked"" by Mr Singh’s response because\xa0there was ""no intention or directive"" from him to tell the truth at the time, said the COP report.\nMs Khan told\xa0the committee that Mr Singh had not presented her with a choice on Oct 3, but had told her that\xa0""if she continued the narrative, he will not judge her"", the report said.\nShe told the committee that she did not say\xa0she had disassociation. She clarified that she mentioned to the WP disciplinary panel\xa0that she may have symptoms of PTSD.\nWhen asked what symptoms they were, she said one of the symptoms was dissociation,\xa0but had never said that this was something that she was going through.\nDr Cheok explained that dissociation is a symptom, not a medical diagnosis. It refers to the loss of the integrative function of the mind, and may be experienced by normal people in different situations, said the report.\nThe psychiatrist gave evidence to the committee after assessing Ms Khan and interviewing her husband, and said that she ""did not suffer from any significant psychiatric disorder that would have impaired her ability to speak truthfully"" in Parliament or before the COP.\n""Dr Cheok said that Ms Khan did not suffer from any psychiatric disorder that would predispose her to telling untruths,"" added the report.\xa0\n""Having been in practice for more than 25 years, he\xa0said that persons with psychiatric disorders do not generally tell untruths more frequently than any other human being.""\nThe Office of the Clerk of Parliament also said that in response to the summons issued by the Committee on Dec 15, Mr Singh, Ms Lim and Mr Faisal produced ""certain documents"" on Dec 20.\nThey each signed a confirmation that they had produced before the Committee the documents requested, it added.\nDr Cheok also said that Ms Khan did not have PTSD and\xa0did not suffer from ""any significant or material dissociation during the material period"".\n""While Dr Cheok did not deny that Ms Khan had some symptoms of being psychological traumatised, he was of the view that the symptoms did not reach the threshold of a\xa0psychiatric disorder,"" said the COP report.\n""In his view, it was a normal reaction for someone who had gone through a traumatic experience, to continue to have some anxiety when speaking about the topic. This did not mean that the person would be mentally impaired or incapacitated.""\nHe testified that her judgment and decision-making capacity was not impaired and that she was of sound mind.\nDr Cheok was also asked if it was possible that Ms Khan’s judgment could have been affected by the trauma, in a way that caused her to have “false memory creation”.\nHe reiterated\xa0that Ms Khan did not suffer from dissociation and that in his assessment, when Ms Khan spoke of her assault, she was ""not affected to an extent that caused her to lose her mental capacity"".\nHe was then asked whether a person who is suffering from trauma, while still generally high functioning, could be ""capable of sending out a message that selectively contained a lie"".\n""Dr Cheok said that generally it is possible but there also may be other explanations why a person may give a falsehood. However, in the specific context of Ms Khan, Dr Cheok disagreed with this possibility,"" said the COP report.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Raeesah Khan ', ""     The Workers' Party "", '     Pritam Singh ', '     Singapore politics ', '     Committee of Privileges ']}"

      Pritam Singh's words 'your call' under scrutiny as WP leader recalled by COP to give further evidence on Raeesah Khan case
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Workers\' Party (WP) secretary-general Pritam Singh was recalled on Wednesday (Dec 15) by the\xa0Committee of Privileges (COP) to clarify his version of events at an Oct 3 meeting with Ms Raeesah Khan.\nThis was after WP chair Sylvia Lim on Monday\xa0produced a document recording his exchange with Ms Khan at a disciplinary panel meeting on Nov 29.\nThe COP said in its fifth special report issued on Wednesday evening that Mr Singh was\xa0given the opportunity to clarify his evidence following that.\nWednesday\'s session was a much shorter affair, clocking in at just under 40 minutes, compared to the nine hours of questioning that the\xa0Leader of the Opposition faced last week.\nThe document Ms Lim had submitted to the COP were\xa0notes that she had taken\xa0during WP\'s disciplinary panel interview with Ms Khan on Nov 29. It set out an exchange between Mr Singh (PS) and Ms Khan (RK):\nPS: Before Oct session, I met you + I told you it was your call. Did need to tell the truth in Parl occur to you?\nRK: Yes but consumed with guilt + own experience.\xa0Thought it wouldn’t come up.\nPS: Can’t lie right?\nRK: Yes.\nMr Singh testified that Ms Lim’s notes accurately reflected what he had said to Ms Khan during the disciplinary\xa0hearing on Nov 29.\nHe agreed that the phrase ""your call""\xa0might be understood that he had, on Oct 3, told Ms Khan that she had to make a choice as to whether to tell the truth or continue to lie, if she was asked on\xa0Oct 4 in Parliament.\nBut Mr Singh said that what he had meant when he said “your call” was that Ms Khan should take responsibility for her work in Parliament. And it had to be ""looked at in context"".\nOn Oct 4, Ms Khan went on to repeat in Parliament an untruth she had told on Aug 3 - that she had accompanied a sexual assault victim to the police station, who then came out crying as a police officer had made comments about her dressing and the fact that she had been drinking.\nOn Nov 1, Ms Khan made a statement in Parliament to apologise and clarify that she had heard the anecdote at a support group, but lied that she was with the victim as she did not want to reveal that she had been sexually assaulted at 18 while overseas.\nThe whole episode\xa0led to a complaint to the COP being made against Ms Khan, who has since resigned as MP for Sengkang GRC and from the Workers\' Party.\nMr Singh, who had known since Aug 8 that Ms Khan\'s account was untrue, has also been summoned before the COP to give evidence.\nWhile Ms Khan said that she had been told by WP leaders to ""retain the narrative"", Mr Singh has testified that he told her to\xa0""take ownership and responsibility"" for her untruth in Parliament - by which he meant for her to tell the truth.\nOn Dec 15, Mr Singh\xa0told the COP that ""It is your call to make"" were not the words he had\xa0used to Ms Khan on Oct 3, and the words he used did not offer Ms Khan a choice.\nHe added that Ms Lim’s notes also reflected that he had told Ms Khan at the\xa0Nov 29 meeting\xa0that she could not tell a lie.\nHowever, he agreed that it was reasonable to construe the words “your call” to mean that it was a choice for Ms Khan to make.\nWhen asked why he used those words to Ms Khan on Nov 29, he said: ""I think it was in the context of how she was responding to us.\n""I mean, that whole meeting on the 29th was a meeting where she was just continually crying and crying and crying. And in that context, I put a question which I felt could elicit a response, which would be helpful to the DP (disciplinary panel). So that\'s how I put the question.""\nMr Singh was also asked why he had not told Ms Khan on Oct 3 to own up and tell the truth in Parliament, and why he had not made things absolutely clear, in direct terms to Ms Khan.\nMinister for Culture, Community and Youth and Second Minister for Law Edwin Tong, who conducted most of the questioning in Wednesday\'s session -\xa0which was also released on video -\xa0said: ""In context, on the third of October, Ms\xa0Khan was a fresh new MP, a rookie MP one year in Parliament or barely\xa0one year.""\nMr Tong continued: ""And she had admitted two months prior to that she told a lie in Parliament, coming to see her senior leaders of the Workers Party. Would you not accept that\xa0in that context, really, the only thing that you ought to have said to her at that point in time should be: \'Look, Ms Khan, there\'s\xa0a lie on the record, you must go and own up, tell the truth in Parliament if it comes up.\'\xa0Make it very clear, in clear, simple direct terms. Would you agree?""\nMr Singh said that he believed he had communicated this message to Ms Khan in his own way, when he suggested to her on Oct 3 to take ownership and responsibility, said the report.\nMr Singh was also asked about evidence given by one of Ms Khan\'s assistants, Ms Loh Pei Ying. Ms Loh had said she was ""disappointed"" that Mr Singh had left the choice to Ms Khan as to whether she should tell the truth if she was asked about the anecdote in Parliament on Oct 4.\nMr Singh was asked why Ms Loh had this impression from a conversation she had Mr Singh\xa0with Oct 12 - that a choice was given to Ms Khan.\nMr Singh said that the words ""I will not judge you"" seem ""seared"" in Ms Loh\'s mind and she seemed to put a lot of weight on it, while not placing enough emphasis on the ""context"" in which the phrase was used, on taking ""ownership and responsibility"".\nWhen asked if\xa0he agreed that based on the evidence that Ms Loh had given on her takeaway with Mr Singh on Oct 12, her impression was that a choice had been given to Ms Khan on whether to tell the truth, Mr Singh said: ""I think it\'s ... more far more nuanced than that ...\xa0when she prefaces her statement by saying \'I suppose he was implying\'...\n""So I think there\'s quite a lot of grey there. And I would suggest that it was quite clear that Miss Khan, whether she\'s a rookie MP or not, I don\'t think these things even need to be explained that if you tell a lie, you have to,\xa0it\'s just not on, it\'s something you can\'t do.""\nIn a press release, the Office of the Clerk of Parliament said\xa0that the COP has issued a summons to Mr Singh, Ms Lim and\xa0WP vice chair\xa0Faisal\xa0Manap\xa0to produce documents, including internal correspondence between senior leadership, concerning issues raised in the Committee\xa0by Monday.\nThe COP had made requests for these documents from Dec 10 to 14 but the WP leaders\xa0have failed or refused to produce them, said the release.\nParliament said that the committee’s proceedings have ""largely concluded"", but it may hear further evidence ""if it sees fit"". Proceedings have been adjourned to Monday.\n""It will present its findings and recommendations to Parliament in due course.""\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     Committee of Privileges ', '     Raeesah Khan ', '     Pritam Singh ', ""     The Workers' Party "", '     Singapore politics ']}"

      Pritam Singh denies asking Raeesah Khan to take lie 'to the grave', but says no steps taken to correct untruth from Aug to Oct
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Workers\' Party (WP) chief and Leader of the Opposition Pritam Singh testified that he did not tell Ms Raeesah Khan to take a lie she had made in Parliament ""to the grave"", according to a third report released by the Committee of Privileges on the hearings into the matter.\nHowever, Mr Singh, who is also MP for Aljunied GRC, also did not specifically tell Ms Khan to admit the truth despite having communicated with her on multiple occasions, said the\xa0report on Sunday (Dec 12).\nMr Singh also agreed that from Aug 8 to Oct 4, he had not seen any steps taken which would be suggestive of ""coming clean"".\nThe report provided a summary of key points from the evidence provided by Mr Singh on Dec 10 to the Committee of Privileges, which is looking into the complaint against Ms Khan for lying\xa0in\xa0Parliament.\nMs Khan had told an\xa0anecdote in Parliament on Aug 3 about accompanying a sexual assault victim to a police station three years ago, and that the victim had come out crying because a police officer allegedly made comments about her dressing and that she had been drinking.\nThe former Sengkang Member of Parliament\xa0later admitted that she had heard the account in a support group, but had lied because she did not want to publicly admit that she was part of the group and had been sexually assaulted when she was 18 years old.\nOn questioning by the Committee, Mr Singh agreed that telling a lie in Parliament\xa0was a very serious matter, but denied that the police would be adversely impacted by the untruth told by Ms Khan, the report said.\nHe also said that he did not feel that a wrong had been done to the police by Ms Khan’s allegations.\nThese points and Mr Singh\'s account of events since Aug 3 were in the special report released by the Committee, along with four\xa0videos of\xa0Mr Singh\'s testimony.\nThe videos show\xa0that Mr Singh gave evidence for at least nine hours. In its press release, Parliament said that sensitive information had been redacted from the videos.\nMr Singh\'s account of an Aug 8 meeting with Ms Khan, WP chair Sylvia Lim and vice chair Faisal Manap, contradicts Ms Khan\'s testimony to the Committee.\nMs Khan had said in her hearing that Mr\xa0Singh, Ms Lim and Mr Faisal had told her that the best thing for her to do would be to ""continue with the narrative that she had already given in Parliament on Aug 3"".\nBut Mr Singh said in his testimony that there was no substantive discussion at the Aug 8 meeting at his home on what to do about Ms Khan’s untruth.\nAs Ms Khan was leaving Mr Singh’s house, he told Ms Khan, “We’ll have to deal with this issue, but speak to your parents first”, the report said.\nHe had wanted to give her time to speak to her parents, who did not know about the sexual assault,\xa0before coming clean in Parliament, said the report.\nThe report also said that ""Mr Singh agreed that it would be fair to say that Ms Khan would have left the 8 Aug meeting not being very clear in her mind about the Party leaders’ instructions on how to deal with her lie"".\nIt was previously reported that Ms Khan had sent a WhatsApp message to two other party members - Ms Loh Pei Ying and\xa0Mr Yudhishthra Nathan - after the Aug 8 meeting, claiming that she had been told by WP leaders to take the message ""to the grave"".\xa0\nMr Singh denied in his testimony that he had asked Ms Khan to do this.\nWhen asked why Ms Khan might have lied in her WhatsApp message, Mr Singh said that Ms Khan had told a WP disciplinary panel that she may have ""disassociation"".\nDissociative disorders involve a disconnection between a person’s thoughts, memories, feelings or sense of who he or she is,\xa0and can lead to feelings of detachment or amnesia. It can be triggered by trauma or abuse in childhood, according to the American Psychiatric Association\'s website.\nMr Singh\xa0asked the Committee to consider asking Ms Khan to go for a psychological assessment, the report said.\nMr Singh said that after the Aug 8 meeting, he did not check with Ms Khan\xa0whether she had spoken with her parents about her sexual assault nor did he have any discussions with Ms Khan about coming clean on the matter.\nMs Khan had shingles and did not attend the next parliamentary sitting\xa0on\xa0Sep 13. The next conversation they had about this was on Oct 3, a day before Parliament was to sit again.\xa0\nMr Singh said that “if the issue came up”, Ms Khan had “to take responsibility and ownership of the issue”, and if she did so, he “will not judge” her.\nThe report said: ""Mr Singh was asked if he had told Ms Khan directly, to tell the truth in Parliament. He said that he did not specifically tell her to speak the truth, in those terms.\n""Mr Singh however said that was what he had meant, by the words that he had chosen to use.""\nHe agreed with the Committee that none of the preparatory steps - which were taken in the lead up to a\xa0Nov 1\xa0statement where she admitted her lie - were taken before the sitting on Oct 4.\nMr Singh said that this was because he was not sure whether the matter would have come up during that sitting, and if it did not come up, then Ms Khan may not have clarified, the report said.\nThe report said: ""Mr Singh confirmed that he did not specifically tell Ms Khan to clarify the truth on 4 Oct, even if the issue was not raised.""\nAt the Oct\xa04 sitting, Home Affairs and Law Minister K Shanmugam gave a ministerial statement about Ms Khan’s anecdote, and sought clarification from Ms Khan.\nAs Mr Shanmugam was making his ministerial statement, Ms Khan sent Mr Singh a message, asking: “What should I do, Pritam?""\nMr Singh did not respond to Ms Khan before she stood up to answer Mr Shanmugam’s questions. Ms Khan then repeated the lie on Oct 4, in response to Mr Shanmugam’s questions.\nMr Singh said that he read Ms Khan’s WhatsApp message\xa0to him\xa0at 12.45pm, after the exchange between Ms Khan and Mr Shanmugam. Mr Singh told Ms Khan:\xa0""Will speak after sitting. Keep Chair and I posted.""\nMr Singh met with Ms Khan that same day in his office. The report said Mr Singh remembered that he, Ms Lim and Ms Khan had met late that night, some time past 11pm, for a “very, very short” meeting.\nMr Singh recalled that Ms Khan was in a daze and said:\xa0""Perhaps there is another way. That is, to tell the truth.""\xa0Mr Singh testified that he was very upset and replied:\xa0""But look at the choice you made.""\nMr Singh said that his takeaway, based on what Ms Khan said at the meeting, was that she was now prepared to tell the truth, according to the report.\nMr Singh testified that he was relieved because that was the first time he had heard her say she wanted to own up to what she had said in Parliament. He said:\xa0“Good, we’ll talk about it.”\nOn Oct 7, Ms Khan received an email from the police requesting her assistance on her\xa0anecdote. She forwarded the email to Mr Singh, Ms Lim and Mr Faisal, and asked for their advice on what to do.\nThe Committee\'s report said that Mr Singh confirmed that he did not advise Ms Khan to respond to the police, nor did he advise her not to meet the police to answer their questions.\nWhen asked why he had not advised Ms Khan to explain her position to the police, despite being invited by the police to do so three times, Mr Singh said that this was because it was clear to him that Ms Khan’s untruth had to be corrected in Parliament, where it was originally made.\nHe said that he had told Ms Khan to tell the police that she was\xa0going to answer in Parliament.\nMr Singh\'s account of another meeting on Oct 12 was also different from Ms Khan\'s.\xa0\nMr Singh said that at the meeting, Ms Khan was initially still unwilling to make a speech in Parliament to correct her untruth and Ms Lim was very upset about this. Mr Singh impressed upon Ms Khan that there was no other way but to do so, and Ms Khan eventually agreed.\nIn her testimony, Ms Khan had said that Mr Singh and Ms Lim had come to the view that the matter would not be dropped, and was not going to go away. The three of them discussed together, and decided that Ms Khan should come clean and tell the truth.\nOn Nov 1, Ms Khan delivered a statement in Parliament to apologise\xa0for lying, revealing that she had been sexually assaulted years ago.\nThis was followed by statements from the WP on Nov 1 on Ms Khan\'s statement and on Nov 2\xa0announcing the formation of a disciplinary panel to look into\xa0the statements that Ms Khan had made in Parliament.\nWhen asked if he should have disclosed that Ms Khan had confessed to WP leaders months before,\xa0Mr Singh said that he did not think that it was relevant.\nOn why he then revealed this at WP\'s press conference on Dec 2, he said that\xa0by that time, there had already been questions and ""chatter""\xa0in the online space as to when and how much the WP leaders knew about Ms Khan’s untruths.\nMr Singh therefore decided to address this issue, as he anticipated that journalists would ask questions about it.\nThe Committee pointed out to Mr Singh that this ""chatter"" online had existed for some time and was not new, and\xa0Mr Singh agreed.\nMr Singh also denied that he had disclosed their knowledge of her lie because he knew that these facts would also come out in the evidence given to the Committee, which held its hearing with Ms Khan on the same day.\nAccording to the report, Mr Singh said that it was ""not relevant for Party members, the CEC and the public to know these facts"".\nThe Committee proceedings will resume on Monday and at least two more witnesses - Ms Lim and Sengkang GRC MP Associate Professor Jamus Lim - are set to be called.\n', 'related_topics': [""     The Workers' Party "", '     Raeesah Khan ', '     Pritam Singh ', '     Committee of Privileges ', '     Singapore politics ']}"

  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The conflicting accounts of what happened after Ms Raeesah Khan lied in Parliament about a sexual assault case have opened a can of worms that reveal divisions in the Workers\' Party (WP), said political analysts, adding that the matter has raised questions about the party\'s credibility.\xa0\nOn one end, Ms Khan told the\xa0Committee of Privileges that senior WP leaders had advised her to ""continue with the narrative"" after finding out about her lie, as well as “directed her not to respond to the police”.\nThese were among the revelations published on Friday (Dec 3) in a special report from the committee, chaired by Speaker of Parliament Tan Chuan-Jin,\xa0which heard evidence over two days from Ms Khan and three WP members.\xa0\nWP chief Pritam Singh, however, said at a press conference on Thursday that Ms\xa0Khan repeated the lie in Parliament in October - two months after she first alleged that the sexual assault case was mishandled by police -\xa0despite being asked to clarify the matter.\xa0\nThe competing accounts\xa0have sowed ""uncertainty, confusion and perplexity in the Singaporean domestic populace, particularly the supporters of the Workers\' Party"", said\xa0Dr Mustafa Izzuddin,\xa0Senior International Affairs Analyst at Solaris Strategies Singapore.\n""It appears we have only seen the political trailer, with the full movie yet to be aired,"" he told CNA on Saturday.\n""One other implication is that the Workers\' Party was not able to prevent their dirty linen from being aired in public despite there being experienced leaders in their party ranks.""\nPolitical analyst at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) Dr Felix Tan said the entire saga will ""inevitably affect the credibility of the party and its leadership"", with differing accounts leading to unnecessary speculation and detriment to the party both in the short and long term.\nMs Nydia Ngiow, senior director of public policy consultancy BowerGroupAsia, said that the Committee of Privileges\' report has ""definitely opened a can of worms as it relates to the WP, attributing even greater responsibility to the WP leadership than previously thought"".\n""This issue clearly shows a party divided and each new layer that has been unveiled potentially erodes trust that WP built from their members and constituents even further,"" she added.\nMs Khan\'s account of events raises even more questions about WP\'s credibility, she said, ""particularly since what Pritam conveyed during the press conference on Dec\xa02 did not seem to portray a complete picture of the communications between the party leadership and Raeesah"".\xa0\n""Her account portrays the WP leadership as one that not only shirks away from taking tough and decisive actions in stemming issues before they escalate but more importantly, appears to condone dishonesty - raising serious questions about the competency of the party’s leaders, especially when they are looking to establish themselves as a trusted alternative within the opposition,"" she added.\nAssociate Professor of Law at Singapore Management University (SMU) Eugene Tan said the party will need to ""fully cooperate"" with the Committee of Privileges\' probe and put their account in the public domain beyond what was stated at their press conference.\nThey will also need to rebut the evidence provided so far, which is ""damning for the WP leadership"", said Assoc Prof Tan. ""It has the makings of a scandal which hints at lies by the WP leadership. This \'Liarsgate\' is potentially damaging to all in WP.""\nHe added\xa0that the party has to urgently and persuasively correct the narrative that is now in the public domain or face political consequences that are ""too severe to even contemplate"".\nDr Mustafa said that WP should take its time to digest the revelations from the Committee of Privileges hearings\xa0rather than ""resort to a knee-jerk reaction"".\nThe party should then respond ""candidly and steadfastly, with the hope of bringing the matter to a close"", he said.\n""This episode is post-Low Thia Khiang Workers\' Party\'s political baptism of fire in the 21st century,"" he added, referring to the former WP chief and opposition stalwart.\nNTU\'s Dr Tan said WP ""seriously needs to look at its processes on how they conduct themselves internally"" and also in public.\xa0\n""There is a need for the WP to regain voter confidence in the party moving forward. Furthermore, there is a need to look at how the party selects their candidates in the future,"" he said.\n""There are still many questions left unanswered at this point in time. There is a need for damage control ... this entire fiasco might lead to serious divisions and splits within the political party, which would not bode well for the WP.""\nDr\xa0Tan added that the WP leaders need to clear their name and regain public trust in the party, which has been on the ascent in the past few years.\nMs Ngiow said that while the immediate imperative is for WP to quickly establish and communicate clearly the facts to its party members and the public, ""the bigger challenge lies in convincing these segments that the party can be trusted to provide an unvarnished account in the process, given the significant doubt surrounding some of the decisions taken by the party leadership"".\n""Going forward, the party will also be closely scrutinised on how it responds to the damaging account put forth by Raeesah Khan to the Committee of Privileges, as this could lead to further rounds of allegations and counter-allegations that will only harm - and potentially devastate - the party’s credibility in the coming months,"" she said.\nShe added that ""suspicions and apprehension will continue to envelop the party in the interim - possibly leading to splinters within the party ranks"", pointing to the ""unfettered response"" from members like\xa0Loh Pei Ying and Yudhishthra Nathan, who gave evidence to the\xa0Committee of Privileges.\n""If these are not adequately addressed and a trust deficit continues to plague the party going forward, it could potentially have devastating consequences for the party, including possible leadership change ahead of its Central Executive Committee election next year,"" said Ms Ngiow.\nSMU\'s Assoc Prof Tan said WP ""must regain the narrative of this disturbing saga"".\n""We can expect the WP leaders to appear before the Committee of Privileges. There appears to be corroboration of what transpired in the saga and it is imperative that the WP leaders cast reasonable doubt on the evidence thus far. Much is at stake and the party must ultimately prevail in the court of public opinion,"" he added.\nDr Mustafa said that while the WP has taken a political hit from the spate of events, he feels the party\'s ideological brand will ""outlast its present political predicament"".\n""It has sufficient time to regain the trust of the Singaporean domestic populace and bounce back to be the opposition party of choice before the next general election,"" he said.\n""A significant challenge for the WP is whether it can retain the middle ground support it garnered in the last general election after this current political saga. Their support is critical for WP to retain its current constituencies while seeking to expand its reach to other constituencies.""\nAssociate Professor of Political Science at the National University of Singapore Chong Ja Ian said the extent of the effects will only be known at the next election, and that even the polls will be coloured by events that occur afterwards.\n""The WP is a political party. Like any organisation, issues will arise from time to time. We saw this with the PAP and TraceTogether,"" he said.\xa0\n""What matters is how the WP is upfront about what happened and how they handled what is a very difficult set of circumstances. Let us not forget that at stake is the treatment of a survivor of sexual assault and the associated trauma she faces. This is not a simple matter of covering up or negligence. There are different sensitivities and considerations involved.""\nOn the saga\'s overall impact on WP, he said it depends on people’s longer-term impression of the party as events unfold.\n""That is not something anyone can predict at this point,"" he added.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Raeesah Khan ', ""     Workers' Party "", '     Pritam Singh ', '     Singapore politics ']}"

      Commentary: Almost one year on, what has livestreaming of Parliament achieved?
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Since Jan 4, the public has been able to watch the proceedings in Singapore’s Parliament as they unfold, even if few might have lasted through the 10-hour marathon sessions in September and October.\nThis has raised the level of public engagement in the governance process and improved the quality of data and argumentation in our legislature.\nSurely, it has\xa0also chastened our politicians to maintain integrity and dignity in their approach to the thrust and parry of parliamentary debate. \nUnfiltered, the livestream hosted by the Ministry of Communications and Information was originally thought to be a bad idea - for fear it would feed the grandstanding, seeking to provoke rather than persuade with rigorous, rational deliberation. \nFar better, it was thought, to leave it to professional journalists. They would spotlight key debates and decisions, disciplined by the constraints of time and conciseness, and be guided by a “nation-building” ethos expected of them. \nOf course, this has long been overtaken by netizens and citizen journalists crafting what they think people should really be reading and thinking. \nAudiovisual recordings and transcripts of parliamentary proceedings remain available for record-keeping and deep analysis.\nSo, what difference has the livestreaming of parliamentary sessions made on national discourse?\nFirst, the live medium has lent immediacy to the reactions and responses of the public to parliamentary business. This is a lesser evil than the apathy or cynicism of citizens. \nOrdinarily, a few hundred viewers tune in to Parliament at any time, but more do so when they are made aware ahead of time that hot-button issues would be debated. \nViewers also invite contacts to join in through social media feeds but there is no doubt both supporters and opponents of parliamentarians do the same. Reactions can emerge swiftly. \nOn Sep 15, while the 10-hour debate on the value of Singapore’s free trade agreements and their implications on foreign worker policy raged on, the public was already offering assessments about the parliamentarians’ performance - primarily Progress Singapore Party Non-Constituency Member of Parliament (NCMP) Leong Mun Wai who put forward the initial motion of debate, Finance Minister Lawrence Wong, who offered a competing motion, and Minister for Home Affairs and Law K Shanmugam.\nSocial media lit up asking why Mr Leong could not be more persuasive about his specific issue with the FTA with India with its obligations on flows of workers to Singapore. \nOthers asked if the Government bench was trying to obfuscate the issue by alleging that Mr Leong was racist for picking on this particular agreement.\nAlso, who will forget the “hot mic” controversy involving two Ministers when they disparaged Mr Leong’s performance? \xa0This could only have happened because viewers were tuned in live, chanced upon it and fanned political wildfire by circulating the timestamp of the incident. \nIn the end, the People’s Action Party (PAP)-dominated Parliament passed Mr Wong’s motion on securing Singaporeans jobs and livelihoods\xa0and rejected Mr Leong’s motion. One of the front bench ministers caught on the hot mic, Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, apologised to Mr Leong for his “private remarks” the next day.\nAnother indication of this extreme form of engagement arose when Workers’ Party Member of Parliament (MP) Raeesah Khan (WP-Sengkang) admitted she had misled Parliament in August about the police’s alleged insensitive management of a victim of sexual abuse. \nOn Nov 1, word of her mea culpa circulated as she delivered it and netizens reacted contemporaneously.\nSecond, livestreaming has thrown up these ground-up reminders to parliamentarians that they are held to higher standards of ethics and decorum.\nThe virality of circulation through social media means parliamentarians can be held accountable for their conduct in ways that can be unexpected and more severe than might have been a year ago.\nThird, the development has spurred more evidence-driven debates on and detailed explanations of public policy and its implementation. \nIn Parliament in July and September, the Government released annual data under the FTA with India for the first time, indicating the number of intra-corporate transferees - overseas employees at multinational companies who have worked for at least a year in the company before being posted to a branch or subsidiary in Singapore – has been “consistently low”. \nHard numbers on workers entering through FTA provisions helped some members of public to recognise there were other reasons for the sense of insecurity Singaporean workers are feeling.\nThose other factors are now being addressed through measures announced in Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong’s National Day Rally (NDR).\nWe see the same with the complexities of the Government’s management of the COVID-19 pandemic. \nFacing complaints on the ground, it was possible to assess not just the validity, but also the sincerity, of the leaders’ explanation of the challenges in implementing the Home Recovery Programme.\nThe success of the livestreaming is not a question of whether vast numbers of people tune in as they might on Budget Day or the NDR. \nInstead, it should be about the less quantifiable aspects: The quality of response, its impact on policy discussions especially with the public, and its contribution to the strengthening of our democracy — that people know we can participate in policy formulation if we want to, listen to responses to our feedback, and assess our elected representatives’ contributions.\nThese boil down to why our votes matter. \nWe can watch how a dominant PAP exercises its power and assess the wisdom of the opposition and nominated MPs in saying ”nay” to a bill, as they did after a robust 10-hour debate in October on the Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Bill which became law that night. \nWith 104 parliamentarians including the nominated ones, no other media can do justice in terms of coverage.\nMaking the livestream available as a default provides the political and psychological countermeasure to an age of rising cynicism about mainstream media and ruling elites.\nThose who worry they are being fed selective parts of the situation know where and how they can view things uncut and in real time. This is also a deterrent against misinformation.\nThe open contestation of ideas on the live broadcast is far better than any civics or political theory lessons can deliver on how our parliament works. \nThis direct process of communication can motivate a higher level of well-informed and even real-time citizen involvement in the enterprise of achieving progress for our nation.\nDr Gillian Koh is Deputy Director (Research) and Senior Research Fellow at the Institute of Policy Studies, National University of Singapore.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Singapore Parliament ', '     Ministry of Communications and Information ', '     Singapore politics ']}"

      Cabinet reshuffle: Race for Prime Minister post remains open, say analysts
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The race remains open for the three ministers who are in the running to be\xa0Singapore\'s next Prime Minister, and their performance in\xa0new appointments\xa0after\xa0a Cabinet reshuffle on Friday (Apr 23) will bear watching, political observers told CNA.\nOn Friday, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong appointed seven ministers to new ministries in an extensive Cabinet reshuffle, which\xa0came only nine months after the\xa0Cabinet was formed.\xa0\nThis was triggered in part by Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat\'s decision to step aside as ""first among equals""\xa0of the fourth generation or 4G leaders in the People\'s Action Party (PAP), and to step down as Finance Minister.\nTwo ministers\' moves\xa0in particular,\xa0raised eyebrows among observers as their portfolios are changing less than a year from when they were appointed last July after the General Election.\nMr Lawrence Wong, currently the Education Minister, has been promoted from Second Finance Minister to Finance Minister, while Mr Ong Ye Kung will\xa0be relinquishing the transport portfolio to become Health Minister.\nBoth will be co-chairs of the COVID-19 multi-ministry taskforce. Meanwhile, Mr Chan Chun Sing, Minister for Trade and Industry, is moving to the Ministry of Education.\nAll three are seen as contenders for the post of Prime Minister.\n""FACE OF SINGAPORE\'S PANDEMIC RESPONSE""\nMr Wong\'s promotion to Finance Minister ""reinforces the notion that he is a serious candidate for premiership"", said\xa0Dr Gillian Koh, deputy director of research at the Institute of Policy Studies.\nIn particular, moving him from the Education Ministry after so short a time is\xa0""significant"", said National University of Singapore Associate Professor of Sociology Tan Ern Ser.\n""It suggests to me that he is on a trajectory likely to lead to a higher appointment. Moreover, he will be the incumbent co-chair for handling the COVID-19\xa0situation,"" he said.\nAs observers have noted before, Mr Wong\'s handling of the COVID-19 crisis has raised his profile and won him plaudits.\xa0He will now be joined by Mr Ong, whose move from the Transport Ministry also came sooner than expected.\nMr Ong and Mr Wong are ""now placed on\xa0equal footing as co-chairmen of Singapore’s multi-ministry taskforce on COVID-19"", Dr Koh noted.\xa0\nThis shows that the PAP leadership wants to present\xa0to Singapore and the world how both ministers can work together, ""where their skills and abilities might differ but also complement each other"", she added.\xa0\nSingapore Management University Associate Professor of Law Eugene Tan said that both ministers will be the face of Singapore’s pandemic response going forward.\n""That would put them very much in the public eye and how they work together and profile the 4G leadership is of utmost importance.\xa0They must inspire trust and confidence in Singaporeans in the 4G leadership,"" he said.\nA ""CURIOUS"" MOVE\nOn Mr Chan\'s appointment to the Ministry of Education, Dr Koh said\xa0the move\xa0was ""curious"".\xa0\nThe Education Ministry\xa0is an ""internally oriented ministry"" compared to the Ministry of Trade and Industry, where he has demonstrated Singapore\'s ""commitment to regional multilateralism through the\xa0Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership"", she explained.\n""(The new appointment)\xa0will give him the opportunity to strengthen his political capital locally. It is a ministry which has in the past years announced extremely important reforms and is now in the mode of implementing those reforms,"" she said.\xa0\n""We know he is the poster boy for meritocracy so as a narrative, it is helpful for him to helm this ministry.""\nMs Nydia Ngiow, senior director at consultancy BowerGroupAsia Singapore\xa0felt that while education is a heavyweight portfolio and the appointment suggests that Mr Chan\xa0remains a key contender for the 4G leadership, leaving the trade and industry portfolio means that he will not be featuring prominently in the Government’s efforts on COVID-19. \xa0\n""Despite Mr Chan having obtained the most ministerial experience among the three - as well as his appointment as second assistant-secretary general of the PAP which underscores his seniority in terms of party ranking - the fact that he has not emerged as a clear frontrunner underscores the lack of sufficient support within the PAP,"" she said.\nBesides the major appointments, Assoc Prof Tan said that the new assignments handed to\xa0Mr Edwin Tong and Dr Tan See Leng shouldn’t be missed.\nDr Tan, who will be Manpower Minister from May 15, will be handling the ""Achilles\' heel"" in Singapore\'s COVID-19 response - the migrant worker dormitories, said Dr Koh.\nMs Ngiow said that\xa0he is one of the ""fastest-rising politicians"" in recent history: ""He has risen faster than Mr Chan Chun Sing, who took two years to become a full minister at a ministry, but trails Mr Heng Swee Keat who was appointed Education Minister right after the 2011 General Elections.""\nMr Tong will stay on\xa0Culture, Community and Youth Minister but will replace Mr Chan as deputy chair of the People\'s Association. This will give him ""more exposure to the ground as a younger 4G leader"", said Dr Koh.\nFIELD STILL OPEN\nDr Koh said that while there has been a\xa0""consequential reshuffle"", the matter of Singapore\'s next leader is still undecided.\n""In terms of power and the accession of the 4G, it is still a bit of a ‘trying out’ and ‘testing out’ phase,"" she said.\xa0""But with each post, each minister is learning something and building up his or her political capital.""\nAssoc Prof Tan felt that the\xa0new appointments for the three ministers\xa0are ""not so much about testing them but sharpening their policy nous, (and) broadening their policy perspectives and exposure"".\n""The narrative of the 4G leadership as a team where their collective experience, expertise, and capabilities being harnessed is reinforced,"" he said.\n""The frontrunners remain Ministers Chan, Ong, and Wong. PM (Lee)\xa0was careful not to give anything away and instead steered the focus on the theme of business as usual to ensure Singapore emerges stronger in this crisis of a generation.""\nDr Koh agreed that there was continuity amid the major overhaul of the Cabinet.\n""What is also important to note is that the key front- or external-facing ministries – Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade and Industry - are helmed by senior and seasoned hands. And at the junior levels, there are the changing of posts but not much more significant moves,"" she said.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Singapore politics ']}"

      ‘I find it a pity’: East Coast GRC residents surprised by DPM Heng's decision to step aside as 4G leader
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Residents of East Coast GRC were surprised to learn that Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat would be stepping aside as leader of the fourth generation team, with some saying that it was a “pity”.\nMr Heng announced on Thursday (Apr 8) that he would stand aside as leader of the 4G ministers, citing his age, health and the need for a “longer runway” for the future Prime Minister.\nHe wrote in his letter to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong: “While I am in good health, it is in the best interests of the nation, for someone who is younger to tackle the huge challenges ahead.”\nWhen CNA visited East Coast GRC -\xa0where Mr Heng is serving as Member of Parliament -\xa0on Thursday evening, many residents had not heard of the news and did not express an opinion on the matter when asked.\xa0\nThose who spoke\xa0to CNA said that they were surprised by the announcement.\nDuring last year\'s election, Mr Heng led a five-member People\'s Action Party to secure about 53 per cent of the vote at East Coast GRC, winning against the Worker\'s Party.\xa0\nAssistant swabber Shaik Huzaini, 28, had not heard of Mr Heng’s decision when approached. However, he said that it was ""unexpected"", as he thought Mr Heng would be the “next one taking care of us”.\n“He cares for Singapore and the future generation,” he said, citing Mr Heng’s contributions\xa0during the COVID-19 pandemic. But Mr Shaik\xa0said that he was “neutral” about the decision and would like to see what happens in the future.\nAnother resident Mr Eldon Sng, 31, said that it was a “big surprise”, but “at the end of the day, (Mr Heng) has done his part as DPM (Deputy Prime Minister)” and wished him well.\nOthers said that it was a “pity” to see Mr Heng step aside from the position.\n“Personally, I think it’s a pity,” said Mr Ben Hiew, 28. “My impression of (him) is good. Because I’m a freelancer, the financial policies he implemented really helped me during COVID.”\n“But I think he knows his own health best. I\'m sure he made this decision knowing (what\'s) better for Singapore. My respect for him definitely increased,” he said.\nEchoing the same sentiment, Mr Poh En Tat\xa0said it was a pity that Mr Heng will no longer be at the helm of the 4G team. The 46-year-old said\xa0he thought\xa0that Mr Heng was “doing quite well” managing Singapore’s financial situation.\nHe added that he often saw Mr Heng around the neighbourhood on his jogs.\xa0\n“He’s walking the ground quite close to the people.

      DPM Heng stepping aside a setback, but not a 'blow' to succession planning: Analysts
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat’s decision to step aside as Singapore’s potential Prime Minister\xa0is a setback to succession planning, but depending on the leadership’s next steps, the impact can be contained, analysts told CNA on Thursday (Apr 8).\n“It’s a setback but not a blow to the succession planning,” said Associate Professor of Law Eugene Tan from the Singapore Management University.\xa0\n“The 4G leadership succession has been structured as a team effort with focus on the collective strength of the 4G leaders.”\nDr Gillian Koh, deputy research director at the Institute of Policy Studies said that while\xa0ministers have stood down in the past, it was never at such a high level. But she emphasised that there remains continuity in Singapore’s political leadership.\n“What is important to note is that it has been reiterated that\xa0PM Lee Hsien Loong will continue to stay on at the helm and Mr Heng will remain as Deputy Prime Minister and Coordinating Minister for Economic Policies,” she said.\nThe latest announcement does, however, raise questions about the People’s Action Party’s (PAP) ability to refresh its leadership, said Ms Nydia Ngiow, Senior Director at BowerGroupAsia Singapore, a strategic advisory consultancy.\nThe big question will be how quickly the 4G leadership will ""pick itself up to come together and act decisively"" in choosing Mr Lee\'s successor, she said.\nIf the 4G team can decide quickly, it will allow the new leader ""a long enough pathway"" to work with Mr Lee towards the next General Election, Ms Ngiow added.\xa0\xa0Associate Professor Tan Ern Ser from the National University of Singapore\'s Department of Sociology said: “It does appear like a severe disruption to the process. However, if there is someone ready to take it from here, then the impact would be minimal or insignificant.”\nDID GE2020 RESULTS PLAY A PART?\nWhen asked if Mr Heng’s decision to step aside came as a surprise, Dr Koh said that it depends. There were questions raised among the general public whether there could be a change in succession plans after General Election 2020, she said.\n“Of course, DPM Heng has said his decision is not linked to the GE but some Singaporeans were wondering if it might affect his standing,” she said.\n“So, to that group of people, whatever the reasoning that is offered now to Mr Heng’s decision to step aside, this announcement is not a surprise.”\nAlthough Mr Heng had on Thursday\xa0denied that the results of last year’s General Election had influenced his decision, Nanyang Technological University political observer Felix Tan said that could have played a role in his ceding the leadership.\xa0\n“I think there’s still some noise on the ground about his performance during the election,” said Dr Tan.\xa0\nThe last elections saw Mr Heng\xa0move from Tampines Group Representation Constituency (GRC) - where he had been a Member of Parliament since 2011 - to East Coast GRC.\nThere, the PAP’s five-member team led by Mr Heng clinched about 53 per cent of the vote,\xa0narrowly winning against candidates from the Workers’ Party (WP).\nLast year\'s General Election saw the PAP’s vote share slip to 61.2 per cent, while the WP was able to win the newly-formed Sengkang GRC as well as hold on to Hougang SMC and Aljunied GRC - becoming the first opposition party to win two GRCs.\xa0\nHowever Dr Mustafa Izzuddin,\xa0who is a senior international affairs analyst with management consultancy Solaris Strategies Singapore,\xa0said that the PAP might have fared much worse in East Coast without Mr Heng’s presence, adding that the Deputy Prime Minister helped turn the tide for the party.\nIn July last year, a few weeks after the elections, Foreign Affairs Minister Vivian Balakrishnan had said that 4G ministers were in “complete unity” behind Mr Heng’s leadership.\xa0\nThis suggests that it was down to a personal decision on Mr Heng’s part and not an issue of him not having his party’s support, said Dr Tan.\xa0\nWHO’S NEXT IN LINE?\nDr Mustafa noted that with Singapore keeping its COVID-19 situation under control and vaccinations being rolled out, it was an opportune time to revisit the idea of leadership succession as the country looked forward to its post-pandemic future.\xa0\nObservers identified a handful of candidates for the top role.\xa0\nNTU’s Dr Tan, the co-author of a book analysing the results of the 2020 election, suggested Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing was the most “highly likely candidate” to replace Mr Heng.\nMr Chan had previously been tipped as one of the frontrunners to be the next Prime Minister.\xa0\n“I think we can expect that Chan Chun Sing will rise much faster now,” Dr Tan said.\nAt 51, Mr Chan is at the right age to assume leadership from Mr Heng, who will turn 60 soon, said Dr Mustafa.\xa0\n“Basically, you need someone who is younger than Heng Swee Keat, but not too young where you do not have sufficient political experience,” he said.\xa0\nDr Mustafa also pointed to Mr Chan’s position in the PAP’s hierarchy, noting his position as deputy to Mr Heng in his role as first assistant secretary-general in the party, as an indicator that he may be next in line for the role.\xa0\nNTU’s Dr Tan pointed to Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung, also 51, as a “very strong competitor” who has performed “pretty well”.\xa0\nSMU’s Assoc Prof Tan also tipped Mr Chan and Mr Ong as contenders, along with Education Minister Lawrence Wong, 48.\n“A dark horse is Desmond Lee,” he said, referring to the 44-year-old National Development Minister.\nAssociate Professor Tan from NUS believes\xa0the “new frontrunner” is Mr Wong, whose profile has been raised since taking on the role of co-chair of the multi-ministry task force tackling the COVID-19 crisis.\nCABINET RESHUFFLE\nMr Heng’s announcement has thrown a spanner in the works for succession planning among 4G leaders, said Dr Tan, adding they are now essentially back to square one.\xa0\nPrime Minister Lee Hsien Loong may have to readjust, relook and reassess his team seriously, he said.\xa0\n“The likelihood is that we will see a new Prime Minister only after the next election. Because if a new Prime Minister were to take over at this point in time, it\'s too short a runway for him - or her - to really perform and to garner enough support from the ground,” said Dr Tan.\xa0\nDr Mustafa however disagreed, suggesting that the next Prime Minister could take the helm as soon as next year - the midway point between the last election and the next one.\xa0\nThe upcoming Cabinet reshuffle could produce a few surprises, said Dr Tan, pointing to the possibility of more first-time MPs taking on more senior roles.\xa0\nMr Lee had said that there will be a reshuffle in two weeks, and Mr Heng will be relinquishing his role as Finance Minister, while remaining the Deputy Prime Minister and Coordinating Minister for Economic Policies.\nIPS’ Dr Koh said to look out for who will take over the Finance portfolio.\xa0\n“The Ministry of Finance portfolio should go to a Prime Minister-in-waiting if the 4G wants to provide some forward momentum to the question,” she said.\nMs Ngiow also said to look out for the Cabinet reshuffle as she threw another name into the ring: “For instance, if Tan Chuan Jin is moved from his Speaker position to head a ministry, that would be a clear sign that even he is in the mix to be considered as a potential PM.”\nDr Koh added: “The key point is that the world and therefore Singapore is going through a period of radical uncertainty.\xa0\n""Any leader and eventual new Prime Minster of the country needs to be not just close to the pulse of Singaporeans but have significant exposure and strong networks within the international community to know how to guide the country through the post-COVID new normal as it is the condition of global health and geopolitics that matters greatly.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     Heng Swee Keat ', '     4G leaders ', ""     People's Action Party "", '     PAP ', '     Singapore politics ']}"

      ‘Setback for succession planning’: 4G team to select new leader as PM Lee stays on as Prime Minister
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE:\xa0Singapore’s 4G or fourth generation leadership\xa0team will need more time to select another leader from among them, they said in a statement on Thursday (Apr 8) after Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat announced that he will stand aside as head of the 4G team.\nMr Heng remains a member of the 4G team and will continue in his roles as Deputy Prime Minister and Coordinating Minister for Economic Policies.\nHe will relinquish his role as Finance Minister in the next Cabinet Reshuffle, slated in about two weeks. Mr Heng will also remain as first assistant secretary-general of the People’s Action Party (PAP), said Prime Minister\xa0Lee Hsien Loong at a press conference on Thursday.\n“Tackling Singapore’s pressing immediate challenges and ensuring that Singapore emerges stronger from this crisis remains our foremost priority.\xa0Under these circumstances, the 4G team will need more time to select another leader from amongst us,” said the 4G team in a statement signed by 32 People’s Action Party (PAP) politicians.\n“We have therefore requested PM Lee Hsien Loong to stay on as Prime Minister until such time when a new successor is chosen by the team and is ready to take over.\xa0We are grateful that PM has agreed to our request.”\nThe team issued the statement after a meeting of all the ministers and other office holders, including the Speaker of Parliament Tan Chuan-Jin and NTUC Secretary-General Ng Chee Meng.\xa0\nMr Heng, Mr Lee and the two Senior Ministers,\xa0Mr Teo Chee Hean and Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam, did not attend the meeting.\nThe 4G team\xa0asked for Singaporeans’ support and understanding as they choose another leader.\n“This unexpected turn of events is a setback for our succession planning.\xa0We recognise that Singaporeans will be concerned.\xa0We seek your support and understanding, as we choose another leader for the team.”\nThey added: “We will continue working as a team to serve our people, and to earn the confidence and trust of all Singaporeans.”\nThe leader of the 4G team is seen as Singapore’s next Prime Minister, and Mr Heng was regarded as Mr Lee’s successor after he was elected “first among equals” by his compatriots in early 2018. This new development is a clear indication that succession plans have shifted.\nIn 2018, when Mr Heng was announced as leader of the 4G team, Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing was designated his deputy.\nWhen asked if he will be next in line in the succession, Mr Chan said: “Now that DPM has decided to step aside as a leader of the 4G, the 4G team should be given the opportunity to relook at the question of succession holistically. And we will make a collective decision on who will be the next leader for the 4G in due course.”\nHe added that leadership succession “goes beyond just choosing a leader”, but is about finding and forming the strongest team for Singapore.\nResponding to another question about who are the frontrunners to be the 4G leader, Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung said Singapore’s succession planning should not be seen as a competition or “race”.\xa0\nThe team is not selecting a “boss”, but someone who will bring out the talents and strengths of everyone, he added.\n“When it\'s a race, you only have one winner at the end standing on the podium … with a team, we fight hard … on the field, and if we win, we have a trophy for the nation. And in that winning team, we will have a captain that can bring out the best of everybody,” he said.\n“So that process of developing a strong team and rallying around the \'first among equal\' leader takes some time.”\n""This is a process which takes more than a few months, but I think that it should not take more than a couple of years.\xa0And I hope that ... I will have a clear outcome before the next General Election,"" he said.\nElaborating on Mr Ong\'s analogy, Mr Lee\xa0said\xa0the selection process is about team building and developing relationships among the team members.\n""Over time, from that balance and that chemistry, you\'re able to identify who amongst the people can maximise the performance of the team, and make all the pieces fit together and add up to more than the sum of its parts.""\nMr Lee added that the long process was also why they decided to announce Mr Heng\'s decision now, before a successor is identified.\n""The public also has to know what the real status is in order to know what progress is being made and where they stand,"" he said.\xa0\n""If we were a listed company, we would have clear obligations to make this public within quite a quick time, which is what we have done.""\nThe 4G leaders also said that Mr Heng has played a critical role in leading key initiatives of the Government, including delivering five Budgets last year amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\n“We have all benefitted from his experience and expertise, and we look forward to his continued advice and contributions as we navigate our recovery and chart Singapore’s path forward,” said the statement.\nEducation Minister Lawrence Wong, one of the 4G team at the press conference, said that Mr Heng’s decision exemplifies the qualities associated with him as someone who is “selfless, with a deep sense of duty, and a strong conviction to do what is best for Singapore, and Singaporeans”.\n“Importantly, he has left a strong imprint on all of us in terms of his collaborative and consultative style of leadership,” said Mr Wong.\xa0\n“We\'ve all benefited from his experience and expertise,” he added.\nThe team also said\xa0they respect and accept Mr Heng’s decision to stand aside as leader of the 4G team.\n“We appreciate what a difficult decision it must have been.\xa0But no one could have foreseen the disruption of COVID-19, the great uncertainty it has created, and its long-lasting impact.\xa0We know that he has made the decision with Singapore’s long-term interests at heart.”\nThe statement was signed by Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan, Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen, Home Affairs and Law Minister K Shanmugam, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong, Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing, Communications and Information Minister S Iswaran, Education Minister Lawrence Wong, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu, Minister for Social and Family Affairs Masagos Zulkifli, National Development Minister Desmond Lee, Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung, Manpower Minister Josephine Teo, Ministers in the Prime Minister’s Office Indranee Rajah, Mohamad Maliki Osman and Dr Tan See Leng, Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Edwin Tong.\nIt also includes Speaker of Parliament Tan Chuan-Jin, Senior Ministers of State Heng Chee How, Chee Hong Tat, Amy Khor, Dr Janil Puthucheary, Sim Ann, Zaqy Mohamad, Dr Koh Poh Koon; and Ministers of State Assoc Prof Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim, Low Yen Ling, Desmond Tan, Sun Xueling, Alvin Tan, Gan Siow Huang, Tan Kiat How and NTUC Sec-Gen Ng Chee Meng.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Heng Swee Keat ', '     PAP ', '     Lee Hsien Loong ', '     Singapore politics ']}"

      'We are a misunderstood place': New MP Carrie Tan on Yishun, politics and her tattoos
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: Nee Soon GRC Member of Parliament Carrie Tan was surprised to be invited in 2018 for tea sessions with the People’s Action Party (PAP) - a precursor to becoming a candidate for the party.\nThe founder of Daughters of Tomorrow (DOT), a non-governmental organisation that helps lower-income women, felt that she had been quite critical of the Government. But she thought this would be a good opportunity to speak out for the underprivileged to the ruling party.\n“I feel like I need to help them understand certain things that I'm seeing, and certain issues that they may not have had the opportunity to deep dive into,” she said. “Every single tea session for me was an advocacy moment.”\nAlong the way, she met different ministers and MPs, and became convinced of “their conviction and their intention to really do good by Singaporeans”, she said.\nOne deciding factor was that when she spoke her mind, she felt that people listened.\xa0“I think one of the key considerations I had was ... Do I have to be not myself? Do I have to kind of fit into a certain box in order to get onto this process? I was a bit sceptical,” she said.\xa0\n“But it was very encouraging, because every step of the way, I was very honest. I shared my views, and people listened, and they were receptive to what I had to share … (and) I guess in the end, I felt like: Can lah!”\nShe said that in her years of trying to solve the issue of poverty, she had seen that the challenges low-income families face are “multi-faceted”.\n“Being in politics gives me a wider platform to take a more holistic approach to looking at some of the things that society needs to probably shift or change in order to provide better scaffolding and stepping stones for the poor among us,” she said.\n“WE ARE A MISUNDERSTOOD PLACE”\nSeven months on from the 2020 General Election, the Nee Soon South representative seemed\xa0quite at home at an Yishun Ring Road coffee shop having crispy prata and a barley drink.\xa0\nSitting along a busy thoroughfare flanked by two coffee shops,\xa0the interview was interrupted a few times by residents saying “hi” to their MP.\nWhen\xa0Yishun’s reputation as a magnet for cat killers, murders, petty crime and bad news in general is brought up, she bristled: “I love Yishun, I love the people here. We are a misunderstood place, okay.\n“We have the most charming, loveliest people. So many do-gooders,” she effused, gesturing at the people having their dinner or drinks.\n“You see the coffee shop uncles. They will like from here shout across to there. It's very kampong, I love it.”\nShe admits that there are residents who compare her to former MP Lee Bee Wah, who was MP there for 14 years, and was affectionately known as “Hua Jie” or “Sister Flower” among Yishun residents.\n“I think there's only natural and normal. There are different kinds of residents, some of them will compare and say: Hey, you know, last time Dr Lee used to do this this this, that that that ... I can learn from that,” she said.\n“Then there'll be other residents who say: Don't worry, just be yourself. We support you, just to do what you do.”\nA NEW SOCIAL ENTERPRISE\nThe little changes that Ms Tan has\xa0started to make can be seen in a banner with bright pink lettering advertising her weekly house visits. It reads “Bringing care to you on …” followed by the days and\xa0times, and the hashtag #Carriecares.\nAt her division, Nee Soon South, she has changed the language of the reminder notices for residents that fall into arrears for conservancy charges.\n“We've adopted a much more supportive stance to say that if you're meeting any kind of financial hardship\xa0that's causing you to not be able to pay your bills, please reach out to us ... Don’t bear this alone,” she said.\xa0\nThe town council is also making an effort to reach out to these residents to ask them if they need support, and referring them to support agencies, she said.\nMs Tan, who has stepped down as the head of DOT, also plans to pilot a new social enterprise, called RISE Community, at Yishun. While she’s known as an advocate for women’s issues and gender equality, she now wants to reach out to men.\n“I spent five, six years of my life building up an engine to enable the women. This is like the next step where I'm looking to do more work to enable men,” she said.\nThe details are under wraps, but she said the NGO will reach out to men who have lost their jobs or are in danger of losing them, to help them develop better coping mechanisms and create a supportive community for them.\nThere are many initiatives for people to gain new skills and match them to jobs, but she thinks that the ability to embrace such opportunities requires a mindset change. “I think we underestimate the extent of mental emotional toil that poverty has on people. We expect them to just pick their feet and then ... find a job the next day.”\nMore would be shared later this month when the initiative is launched, she said.\nWhen asked about her thoughts on the 2021 Budget that was delivered on Feb 16, she expressed concern about the fast pace at which Singapore’s economy is transforming.\n“Although it is necessary, I do find that we should consider putting more resources into helping those who are further behind at the lowest or lower income groups, who may find it harder to catch up,” she said.\n“I think that the cost of not mitigating the crisis that the lowest income groups are facing, that may come to bite us in the future, because then it will create consequences in terms of their mental, emotional and physical health.”\nACTIVIST OR MP?\nWith her salt-and-pepper hair, activist background and tattoos, Ms Tan is\xa0not in the usual mould of a PAP MP.\nWhen\xa0asked\xa0about her tattoos (there are three), she\xa0shared\xa0that the kite tattooed on her wrist symbolises “letting go”, and was inked in 2013, when she pivoted her social enterprise to a charity.\n“That was the best decision I made - to really scale up the work. Kite - you have to let go to fly further,” she said.\nDoes she still see herself as activist or is she more of an MP these days?\n“These are just job titles,” she said as she listed her various roles these days as grassroots adviser, parliamentarian, Nee Soon town council vice-chair and continued involvement in her social enterprises.\n“At the end of the day, I'm serving the people, and I'm passionate about moving certain causes.”\nIn the course of the conversation, she reflects that her views have evolved in the process of being initiated into politics and after talking to more people from different age groups, and with various cultural backgrounds and beliefs.\n“Being an activist, I can also sometimes have certain rather idealistic views about certain topics,” she said.\n“I definitely grew in my understanding and perspective of the diversity of opinions people have about different issues … having understanding and mutual respect in society is very important, and I think I have faith that in Singapore, we are a society where we can agree to disagree on things.”\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Singapore politics ', ""     People's Action Party "", '     PAP ', '     Carrie Tan ']}"

      'Good balance' of old and new faces in new Workers' Party CEC, say analysts
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The new\xa0Workers\' Party (WP) Central Executive Committee (CEC) has a ""good balance"" of old and new faces, and threw up few surprises, analysts told CNA.\nOn Sunday (Dec 27), the opposition party\'s cadre members elected five\xa0new faces to its top leadership while retaining Ms Sylvia Lim as chair\xa0and Mr Pritam Singh as secretary-general.\nThe four Sengkang\xa0GRC Members of Parliament, who won\xa0the Group Representation Constituency\xa0in the July General Election, were all voted into the CEC. They are Ms He Tingru, 37, Mr Louis Chua, 33, Dr Jamus Lim, 44, and Ms Raeesah Khan, 27.\nMs Nicole Seah, 34, is the fifth new face. Her East Coast GRC running mate Mr Kenneth Foo, 43, was also re-elected, after having served in the CEC from 2016 to 2018.\nWhile three of the Sengkang MPs are relatively new,\xa0having run and won in their first electoral outing this year,\xa0political observers said that their inclusion in the CEC was expected.\n""The \'Sengkang Four\'\xa0being elected to the CEC is not too much of a surprise. Having earned the mandate of the voters, the party cadres would need a compelling reason to deny them being on the CEC,"" said Associate Professor\xa0Eugene Tan,\xa0from the Singapore Management University\'s (SMU) School of Law.\nNanyang Technological University\'s Assistant Professor Walid Jumblatt Abdullah said\xa0it was a ""sensible"" move that would quell potential tension in the party that could arise if elected MPs were not also senior party leaders.\n""The WP has had infighting before, with Chen Show Mao challenging Low Thia Khiang ...\xa0it does make sense to have all\xa0those with (MP) positions in the CEC\xa0and it is also looking to quell any form of internal tension and factionalism.""\nOn Mr Foo\'s and Ms Seah\'s election, analysts\xa0said that the East Coast GRC team put up a good fight there despite losing to the heavyweights from the People\'s Action Party (PAP), which included Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat. The WP team has also continued to walk the ground there since the election.\n""Ms Nicole Seah appears to have made a strong impression on the party despite being relatively new to WP. Her trajectory within the party leadership bears close watching,"" said Assoc Prof Tan.\n""Mr Foo’s election suggests that he is highly regarded within the party and will feature in the WP’s plans going into the next General Election.""\nA WP member since 2006, Mr Foo contested in\xa0Nee Soon GRC in the\xa02015 General Election and\xa0was WP\'s deputy organising secretary from 2016 to 2018. Ms Seah, formerly of the National Solidarity Party, joined WP in 2015.\nAsst Prof Walid added that the team the WP sends to East Coast has traditionally been its ""Team B"", second to its Aljunied GRC team, and it was expected that the team members would be in the CEC.\nThe Aljunied GRC MPs, Ms Lim, Mr Singh, Mr Faisal Manap, Mr Leon Perera and\xa0Mr\xa0Gerald Giam were all elected to the CEC, along with Hougang MP Dennis Tan.\xa0\nThe other two committee members making up the 14 are former WP chief Low Thia Khiang, 64, and former MP\xa0Png Eng Huat, 59, who both did not run in the recent election.\nThe average age of the new CEC is about 45 years old, compared to about 49 years old in the 2018 committee.\xa0\nThere is a ""good balance"" of new and old faces in the line-up, said Dr Felix Tan, associate lecturer at the Singapore Institute of Management Global Education.\n“I think it’s high time that a younger team take over the helm,"" he said. ""It’s about getting this crop of younger members to develop … and this sort of renewal needs to happen for the party to regenerate itself.""\nWith nine members in their 20s to 40s, the team\xa0will have a longer runway to learn the ropes, analysts said.\n""They\'re good to go for many, many more years to come ... They have a good 10, 15 years ahead of them,"" said Asst Prof Walid, adding that there should not be too many concerns about renewing the party now.\nThere is still continuity within the WP with senior members Mr Low, Mr Png and Ms Lim remaining in the committee, analysts said.\n""Mr Low and Mr Png are the two oldest CEC members elected yesterday. For me, it is significant that they remain politically active and can be counted on to play a part in the party\'s plans in the next General Election.\xa0\n""They have not retired from politics and so the possibility of them\xa0being fielded in the next General Election\xa0remains a live one,"" said SMU\'s Assoc Prof Tan.\n', 'related_topics': [""     Workers' Party "", '     WP ', '     Singapore politics ']}"

      IN FOCUS: The implications of a delayed transition to Singapore's next generation of leaders
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The transition to Singapore’s next leadership had seemed largely settled at the beginning of 2020.\nThe wheels had been set in motion long before, with Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong saying as early as 2012 that he aimed to hand over the reins of power by the age of 70 in 2022.\nThere was some uncertainty about the process when a PM-designate had failed to emerge by the end of 2017, prompting\xa0Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong to ""nudge"" the process along with a Facebook post\xa0that said: ""One urgent challenge I would like to see settled is our fourth generation leadership.""\nThe younger political office holders, dubbed the fourth generation –\xa0or 4G –\xa0leaders, chose current Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat as ""first among equals"" by\xa0early 2018.\nThen COVID-19 struck, the economy tanked and the transition, like almost everything else in the midst of this pandemic, was facing potential issues.\nThe transfer of power to a fourth prime minister, which was expected by 2022, is now contingent on the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAs it became clear what havoc the COVID-19 pandemic would wreak around the world, Mr Lee pledged at his Fullerton rally during July’s General Election that he and his peers would see Singapore through this crisis.\nLast month, former Deputy Prime Minister\xa0S Jayakumar and Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong used the same idiom to underline this message: That Singapore should not “change horses in midstream”.\nMr Lee reiterated his commitment to stay in the leadership post at the People’s Action Party’s (PAP) conference on Nov 8, saying to party activists: “Leadership renewal remains one of my top priorities. But as I have explained, because of the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic impact, it is my duty to see our nation through the crisis, before I hand over responsibility for Singapore in good shape to the next team and into safe hands.”\nWhen this happens\xa0depends on how soon the threat of COVID-19 and its fallout abates, but Professor Jayakumar has said it could even extend to the next election, due in 2025.\n""What if Singapore is still in dire straits in four\xa0to five years’ time closer to the next General Election?"" Prof Jayakumar asked in his book Governing: A Singapore Perspective, which was published last month. Views that Mr Lee should ""remain longer at the helm have intensified"", he said.\n""Of course, if \'normalcy\'\xa0has been restored before the next GE, I think the public will support his desire to step down as PM. However, if the crisis persists, I believe many Singaporeans will want him to reconsider that aspect of his timeline as well, and hand over only after Singapore has turned the dangerous corner,"" he said.\nBENEFITS OF A “LONG RUNWAY”\nAnalysts CNA spoke to had differing views on what the revised timeline for the transition might look like, but had no doubt of the need for all hands to be on deck at this time.\nThere are advantages to having a longer runway for the next generation of leaders before they take over the reins,\xa0if it was “only for as long as it is needed”, said political observer and Associate Professor of Law Eugene Tan from the Singapore Management University.\nFor Mr Lee to hand over to his successor a ""clean slate"", with the pandemic under control\xa0and Singapore on the path to economic recovery, would be in keeping with the practice of previous prime ministers, he said.\nWhen Mr Goh handed over the reins to Mr Lee on Aug 11, 2004, it was after the severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, crisis had been dealt with. Mr Lee Kuan Yew did so on Nov 28, 1990, a day after securing points of agreement with his Malaysian counterpart, Dr Mahathir Mohamad, on Malayan Railway land in Singapore – a long-time bugbear in bilateral relations, Assoc Prof Tan wrote in a commentary.\nHe and other analysts said that the 4G leadership will also benefit from having more time to hone their skills with the mentorship of the 3G leaders.\xa0\n“This enables the people\'s trust and confidence in the government to remain strong, sustainable and secure which would ultimately benefit the 4G leadership,” said Assoc Prof Tan. “Third, a delay also enables the Government to focus on the pandemic crisis without being unnecessarily distracted.”\nMr Leonard Lim, country director for Singapore for government affairs consultancy Vriens & Partners, pointed out that the 4G leaders have had a comparatively shorter runway in politics compared to their predecessors.\n“The bulk of them entered politics in the 2011 GE and have only spent a decade in a much rougher environment in local politics, as well as a much more unpredictable geopolitical and economic environment. Mr Goh Chok Tong spent 14 years in politics before becoming PM, Mr Lee Hsien Loong 20 years,” he said.\nMr Lee spent 14 years as Deputy Prime Minister, while Mr Goh was PM-in-waiting for six years,\xa0after being chosen by his peers, before taking on the top job.\nAmong the 4G leaders elected in 2011 was Mr Heng, 59, who has been Deputy Prime Minister since May last year. He\xa0is also\xa0the Finance Minister and Coordinating Minister for Economic Policies.\xa0\nThe younger ministers in 2018 issued a statement in support of his leadership, and recognising Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing as his second-in-command.\nAfter Mr Heng was appointed first assistant secretary-general of the PAP, usually the precursor to being anointed prime minister, Mr Lee said in a Facebook post on Nov 23, 2018:\xa0""I support the decision of the younger team, and am happy with this outcome.\n""I have known and worked with Swee Keat and Chun Sing for some years now, and watched them grow in their different responsibilities. They have complementary strengths, and make a strong pairing.""\nIn a 2019 Cabinet reshuffle, Mr Heng was made Deputy Prime Minister – another sign that he would be the next prime minister. Senior Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam said then that it was a ""major step in leadership succession"".\n""Swee Keat is the best person to move up to become DPM and take over as PM during the next term of government. He has exceptional ability, mettle and the confidence of the 4G team,"" he wrote in a Facebook post.\nThe ministers who signed the 2018 statement endorsing Mr Heng included Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu, Minister in the Prime Minister’s Office Indranee Rajah, Manpower Minister Josephine Teo, Education Minister Lawrence Wong, National Development Minister Desmond Lee, Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung, Minister for Social and Family Development Masagos Zulkifli and Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Edwin Tong.\nCNA contacted the offices of Mr Heng and Mr Chan, inviting them to comment on the transition timeline, as well as the eight other 4G leaders mentioned above.\nAll declined to comment or did not respond.\nDELAY SHOULD NOT BE “INORDINATE”\nStill, while there are benefits to a longer transition, observers warned that the delay should not be “inordinate”.\n“Questions will invariably be raised in the event of an inordinate delay over whether the 4G leadership is equal to the task of leading Singapore in the post-COVID era,” Assoc Prof Tan said.\nAssociate Professor Tan Ern Ser from the National University of Singapore\'s Department of Sociology said the costs of having a transition that is much longer than expected outweigh the benefits, and would not give citizens much confidence in the 4G leaders.\n“If PM Lee stays on till 2025 or even beyond, it’d likely convey a negative impression that the key 4G ministers, despite being in their late 50s and mid-60s, having gone through a fairly long runway in leadership positions, and probably having PM Lee and the Senior Ministers around as advisers, are still not ready to fly solo,” he said.\nWhen then, might the transition be?\xa0\nAssoc Prof Tan Ern Ser thought it could take place as early as a year after Phase 3 of Singapore\'s reopening kicks in. This is\xa0assuming the pandemic does not resurge, and the economy and the job situation are on “an upward trajectory”.\nSMU’s Assoc Prof Eugene Tan said that to enable the new prime minister to make his mark before leading the ruling party in the next General Election, the handover may take place sometime between January 2023 and mid-2024.\n“But much will depend on how the COVID-19 pandemic evolves and the pace at which the Singapore economy recovers,” he said.\nAFTER 2025?\nBut what if the transition happens after GE2025? That is a possibility raised by Vriens & Partners\' Mr Lim, who said there are a few considerations complicating the timeline.\n“I see the handover taking place at the earliest in 2023, in the second half of the Government’s term. But that is also complicated by the Presidential Election needing to be held that year,” he said.\nThe latest the handover might happen is a year or two after the next General Election, he estimated, which is likely to take place around 2024-25. If the transition happens\xa0in 2026\xa0then, depending on precisely when the reins of power are handed over, Mr\xa0Lee would be 73 or 74\xa0while Mr Heng would\xa0be 64 or 65.\n“Considering the vastly increased contestation in local politics today compared to those periods, and that the political temperature rises several notches about 18 months before a GE ... it may make sense not to thrust a new PM into the role in the 2023/2024 window even if the COVID-19 crisis has blown over,” he added.\nAssoc Prof Tan Ern Ser said that he believes the changing political landscape and culture is another key consideration. \xa0\nMr Lee Hsien Loong has said that Singapore’s population desires more diverse views and representation in its politics, and that it is a trend that is here to stay. Results from a post-election survey by the Institute of Policy Studies also bore that out.\nIt was one possible factor that led to a dip in the ruling PAP’s popular vote share to 61.2 per cent in the 2020 GE and its loss in Sengkang GRC to the Workers’ Party. With the Sengkang defeat, the PAP team,\xa0which included NTUC secretary-general Ng Chee Meng and office holders Amrin Amin and Dr Lam Pin Min, had to step down as MPs.\nThey lost to a Workers\' Party team with three members taking part in their first polls –Professor Jamus Lim, Mr Louis Chua and Ms Raeesah Khan, who were led by Ms He Ting Ru –\xa0a lawyer on her second electoral outing.\nSaid Assoc Prof Tan Ern Ser: “Perhaps, the fact that GE2020 saw a 4G minister and two younger office holders losing a GRC to a team of political newbies, and some key 4G ministers facing hard fights in the GRCs they contested –\xa0even as PM Lee and SM Tharman remain highly popular – indicates that the key 3G leaders with their vast reserve of political capital still need to stick around a little while more.”\n“4.5G” LEADERSHIP?\xa0\nOne possible implication of the extended transition timetable is that the leadership changeover\xa0could “skip a generation”, analysts said.\n“With a delayed transition, it is entirely possible that the baton from PM Lee may skip a generation and be passed to those in their early and mid-50s by 2025, like Chan Chun Sing, Lawrence Wong and Desmond Lee,” said Assoc Prof Tan Ern Ser.\nIt raises questions over whether Mr Heng will succeed Mr Lee “in the fullness of time”, said Assoc Prof Eugene Tan. Depending on when the Prime Minister steps down, Mr Heng will be in his early- to mid-60s. Mr Lee Hsien Loong was 52 and\xa0Mr Goh was 49\xa0when they became prime minister. Mr Lee Kuan Yew and Mr Goh both stepped down before they turned 70.\n“A \'transition\'\xa0PM may not be the best arrangement for Singapore,” Assoc Prof Eugene Tan said. “I don\'t foresee a generational skip in leadership from 3G to 5G; instead, perhaps, from 3G to \'4.5G\'. However, this could be politically unsettling even if we came out well from the COVID-19 crisis.”\nMr Lim said that given the PAP’s penchant for long-term stability, a prime minister probably should serve at least two five-year electoral terms.\n“Heng Swee Keat’s age may thus be working against him the longer the succession is delayed … But I don’t think it will skip a generation. The handover will likely still be to a fourth-generation leader who is currently in the Cabinet.\n“It will be interesting to watch the dynamics in the 4G the longer the handover is pushed back, because going by the PAP’s longstanding practice, the 4G themselves will have to decide if the identity of the successor should be revisited.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     Singapore politics ', '     GE2020 ', '     Lee Hsien Loong ', '     Heng Swee Keat ', '     In Focus ']}"

      Not the time to 'talk of succession': Former DPM S Jayakumar on Singapore's leadership transition
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: With the COVID-19 pandemic continuing\xa0and set to be a long-drawn-out crisis, it could be better to further delay Singapore\'s political succession,\xa0former Deputy Prime Minister S Jayakumar has said.\n""The way I look at the present situation is - that we are in a very perilous and a very dangerous situation in our history as a country,"" Professor Jayakumar, 81,\xa0said in an interview\xa0on Oct 30 ahead of the release of his book titled Governing - A Singapore perspective.\n""The central point is - that I don\'t think this is the time, really, to talk of succession.""\nHe wrote in the book that,\xa0before the COVID-19 pandemic broke out, he had asked Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong about his decision to retire by age 70, and wondered if Mr Lee had announced his intentions prematurely.\nMr Lee, 68, had said earlier that he would step down after the General Election, which was held in July this year. He had also said that GE2020 would be the last election he would lead as PM.\xa0\nThis changed when the pandemic hit, and the Prime Minister\xa0said during and after the election campaign that he and the current generation of leaders will see Singapore through the crisis.\n""I am glad that PM Lee has given himself some flexibility on the succession timeline. In my view, however capable the 4G leaders, we should not change horses in midstream,"" Prof Jayakumar wrote in a chapter that discusses recent challenges for Singapore.\nThe core 4G leaders expected to take over the helm include Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat, Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing, Education Minister Lawrence Wong, Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung and Minister for National Development Desmond Lee.\nProf\xa0Jayakumar had this to say of their handling of the current pandemic: ""The 4G leaders have shown a steady hand under very difficult circumstances. I and many other Singaporeans were encouraged by the calm and unruffled manner in which they tackled the many twists and turns of the COVID-19 crisis.""\nIn the book, which was launched on Friday (Nov 6), he raised the possibility that Mr Lee could ""revisit his earlier intention not to lead the next general election as PM"".\xa0\n""What if Singapore is still in dire straits in four\xa0to five years’ time closer to the next General Election?""

He was elected as a Member of Parliament in 1980 and has held appointments in various portfolios, most notably as Minister for Law,\xa0Minister for Foreign Affairs and Coordinating Minister for National Security\nHe was appointed a Senior Minister in 2009 and retired from politics in 2011. Before joining politics, he had been the dean of the National University of Singapore\'s law school.\nRecounting how he was recruited by the People\'s Action Party (PAP) in 1980, Prof Jayakumar said that it was not easy to get people to join politics now, with the additional scrutiny from social media.\xa0\xa0\nHe said that Mr Toh Chin Chye, one of Singapore\'s first generation of leaders, first ""popped the question"" to him in 1974, but he said that he was not ready.\nHe was approached a second time in 1979, and was\xa0posed this question: “Supposing you are on the top of our\xa0list, and if you say no, and we have to go down the list and everybody else keeps saying no. We then go to the bottom of the list and then later, would you regret it if things went awry in Singapore?”\nThat evening, he discussed it with his\xa0wife and they concluded that they could not say no, Prof Jayakumar recalled: ""And that’s how I ended up running.""\nYears later, when he wanted to step down as Law Minister,\xa0Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong told him that he could not step down until he found a successor.\xa0\n""So then I looked around who are my best students in law school?

      Expect robust debate on 'emotive' issues in Parliament, but consensus remains key: Analysts on President’s Address
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: With a greater number of\xa0opposition voices in Parliament, Singaporeans can expect more robust debate in Parliament on critical issues, but as President Halimah Yacob emphasised in the President’s Address on Monday night (Aug 24), working towards building a broad consensus would be key, analysts told CNA following the opening session of the 14th Parliament.\nMadam Halimah said in her speech to the 95 parliamentarians that while multiracialism is core to Singapore’s identity, young Singaporeans prefer to talk about these issues more openly, and “in each generation, some will want to discuss sensitive issues afresh”.\xa0\nShe also said that another potentially divisive issue - a sense of the growing competition Singaporeans face from work pass holders - will be addressed.\xa0\n“These are emotive issues that can evoke strong reactions. Debates on such sensitive matters can easily become polarised. So as we open up more areas for meaningful discussion, Singaporeans must work even harder to listen to and understand one another,” she said on Monday.\nIn the 25-minute address that laid out the priorities for the next term of Government, Mdm Halimah also said that securing jobs will remain the Government’s priority for the next few years, and that social safety nets will be further strengthened in the “new normal” to come.\nShe also highlighted how Singapore is at an “inflection point” with new generations of Singaporeans coming of age and a new crop\xa0of leaders emerging.\nPolitical analyst Eugene Tan, an Associate Professor of Law at the Singapore Management University, said that the COVID-19 pandemic has hastened the need to address some outstanding issues and it is necessary to deal with them “resolutely and promptly”.\n“Whether it\'s about a fairer and more just society, local-foreign divide and immigration, and a more diverse, competitive and robust political system. How we respond will very much define our society in the post-COVID world and will determine if we can turn the crisis into opportunity,” he said.\xa0\n“We can\'t kick the can down the road and it\'s time to engage these emotive but critical issues.”\nTACKLING ISSUES HEAD ON\nMdm Halimah’s speech also reflected\xa0how society has changed over the years, observed Dr Felix Tan, associate lecturer in international relations at SIM Global Education. He said this should provide the cue for House members to discuss discomfiting or previously off-limit topics.\n""What stood out in her speech has been how this new government will have their hands full for the next five years dealing with a lot more social issues that a younger - and a more globalised - Singaporean mix are more concerned about,” Dr Tan said.\n“With the President making mention of such issues, perhaps, it is time that we should tackle these issues head on.”\nBut most analysts said that with more open debate, polarisation and discord can ensue, resulting in a fractious society.\nMdm Halimah\'s\xa0reminder to work towards building a ""broad consensus"" was a common theme of presidential addresses past.\xa0But it is one worth bringing up again, said\xa0Dr Gillian Koh,\xa0deputy head of research at the Institute of Policy Studies.\n""This is nonetheless an important point to reinforce given the larger group of opposition parliamentarians – 10 out of the twelve having been elected and from one party – the Workers’ Party,” Dr Koh said.\nOf the 93 elected Members of Parliament sworn in on Monday, 10 are from the opposition Workers’ Party (WP). Party chief Pritam Singh has been designated the official Leader of the Opposition. There are also two Non-Constituency MPs from the Progress Singapore Party for\xa0a total of 12 opposition voices in Parliament.\nPeople’s Action Party (PAP) MPs still dominate the House with 83 elected representatives.\nFAULT LINES AND SCHISMS\nThe worry that Singapore will become more polarised is the “backdrop” to many of the themes raised by Mdm Halimah, said Mr Leonard Lim, country director for Singapore for government affairs consultancy Vriens & Partners.\nSocietal differences that can drive such divides include competition between locals and foreigners for jobs, differences relating to race and religion, and polarisation between the haves and have-nots due to slowing social mobility and the changing jobs landscape, he said. In addition, differing political inclinations could lead to “potential fractures”.\n""The implication is that in this term of government, leaders must do their utmost to keep citizens as united as possible, even as these fault-lines threaten the social fabric and cohesion that have\xa0been painstakingly built up over decades,” he said.\nThere is potential for “ugly political schisms” with a larger opposition presence in Parliament, he added.\n“But the message from the President to prevent Singapore going down this route was clear – Parliament should be a platform for robust but respectful debate, and speeches and rhetoric should not descend into ugly politicking.”\nFor one observer, Mdm Halimah\'s call for Singaporeans to\xa0“learn to agree to disagree” was what stood out for him.\nAssociate Professor\xa0Chong Ja Ian from the National University of Singapore\'s Department of Political Science said\xa0the President\'s speech provided a\xa0“signal for Singaporeans and Parliament to begin talking about race and religion, something that mainstream political discourse has often tried to veer away from”.\n“Agreement may not come quickly, but they can only come if there is sufficient good-faith participation that come without some party wanting to force a preferred, preconceived approach over others,” he said.\nHe said that this would mean a focus on debating issues rigorously rather than launching personal attacks or insinuations of ill intent.\nSMU’s Assoc Prof Tan said that it is clear the Government is prepared for robust debates, but ultimately, the imperative is for these to be purposeful.\xa0\n“I don\'t expect the tone and content (of parliamentary debates) to be significantly different in this new term. But I expect the quality of debates to improve in terms of better engagement of issues and for a toning down on the showmanship and occasional histrionics,” he said.\nPolitical discourse\xa0will also be shaped partly by what happens outside the House with the onus now on citizens to be responsible in discussing such topics, said Mr Lim of Vriens and Partners, adding that hiding behind anonymity and reckless opinions should be called out.\xa0\n“One hopes that reasonable questions on policy matters, as well as thoughtful criticism backed up by evidence, will be surfaced by Singaporeans, considered carefully by the Government, and ultimately lead to more robust policy outcomes,” he told CNA.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Halimah Yacob ', '     parliament ', '     Singapore politics ']}"

      New office holders will bring fresh ideas and perspectives, says PM Lee at swearing-in of new Cabinet
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The new political office holders will bring with them fresh ideas and perspectives, and Singaporeans can be confident in the team, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Monday (Jul 27) at their swearing-in ceremony.\nThirty-three office holders were sworn in at two locations - the Istana and Parliament House. President Halimah Yacob presided over the ceremony which was broadcast\xa0live\xa0on national television.\nSeveral office holders, including\xa0Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat, took their oaths at Parliament House, which was linked by live video to the Istana where Mdm Halimah was.\nMr Lee also highlighted that the Cabinet is a multi-racial one, with seven non-Chinese ministers among the 20 full ministers. The team also has a mix of ministers and office holders from “successive generations”, he added.\n“The more senior ones have seen Singapore through past crises, and can offer valuable guidance and views to help overcome the challenges we face. The younger ministers are increasingly taking the lead, setting the agenda and engaging Singaporeans,” Mr Lee said.\n“The new office holders will bring with them fresh ideas and perspectives, and work hard to master the issues. It is a team that Singaporeans can be confident in, and one that will walk with you every step of the way.”\nNew office holders include Dr Tan See Leng, 55, who was appointed Minister in the Prime Minister’s Office, and new Ministers of State Mr Desmond Tan, 50, Ms Gan Siow Huang, 45, Mr Tan Kiat How, 43, and Mr Alvin Tan, 40.\xa0\nThe five are also first-term Members of Parliament.\nIn his speech, Mr Lee said that good politics depends on both sound institutions and high quality political leadership.\n“More than other countries, Singapore needs leaders who are capable and committed, men and women who have the courage of their convictions, who command the respect of Singaporeans and who can mobilise the population to achieve great things together,” he said.\n“In this election, you have voted for me and my PAP team. With your mandate, I have formed the strongest Cabinet I could, to take Singapore through this crisis and beyond.”\n“UNITE AND FOCUS OUR ENERGIES”\nThe work of the new Cabinet has already begun, Mr Lee said, as he asked for Singaporeans’ support for the new Government.\n“The elections are behind us. Whatever our political persuasions, never forget that we are first and foremost Singaporeans. Let us all unite and focus our energies on the major challenges ahead,” he said.\nOn the challenges ahead, Mr Lee said that Singapore needs to be vigilant amid the COVID-19 situation while it gets the economy going again, but the Government must also look further ahead.\n“Beyond the ongoing crisis, the Government must also keep our eyes firmly on the future; one day, the pandemic will be over, and the economic crisis will pass. When that day comes, we have to be ready for the post-COVID-19 world,” he said.\n“Our aim is not just to survive this\xa0storm, but also to set the long-term direction for our country. We must keep on improving Singapore, year after year, generation after generation.”\nBeyond economic prosperity, the Government must also fulfil the broader ambitions Singaporeans have for the country, Mr Lee said.\n“We aspire to be a fair and just society, with opportunities for all. We wish to fashion an inclusive community, where we look out for one another, reach out to those who need help, and show every Singaporean that they have a stake in our future,” he said.\xa0\n“We want to make this a home where Singaporeans always believe that their children will have better lives than themselves, and the human spirit can flourish. This is the nation we are building together.”\nPOLITICAL SYSTEM MUST WORK WELL\nMr Lee added that to achieve these hopes and dreams, Singapore’s political system must continue to work well for the nation.\n“The election has shown a strong desire among Singaporeans for greater diversity of views in politics. Voters want the PAP to form the government, but they also want more robust debate of policies and plans,” he said.\n“We have to give expression to it, and evolve our political system to accommodate it, while maintaining our cohesion and sense of national purpose.”\nSingapore’s 14th Parliament will have 10 elected MPs from the Workers’ Party and two Non-Constituency MPs from the Progress Singapore Party. Mr Lee has also said that there will be a formal Leader of the Opposition who will be given staff support and resources to perform this role.\n“I look forward to more vigorous but constructive debates in Parliament. I hope our colleagues across the aisle will step up to play their role of a responsible and loyal opposition,” Mr Lee said.\nThe opposition should put forward serious policy alternatives to be scrutinised and debated, he added.\n“This way, we can help voters better understand the issues, choices and trade-offs, and in the process, improve policies and plans, and deliver better outcomes for Singapore,” he said.\nMr Lee, 68, reiterated his intention see through the COVID-19 crisis. He had previously said he wanted to retire before 70.\n“My aim is to see through this crisis and hand over Singapore, intact and in working order, into good hands who can take the country further forward,” he said on Monday. “I ask Singaporeans to extend to the younger ministers the same support that you have given me all these years.""\nWatch the full ceremony:\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     Lee Hsien Loong ', '     Singapore General Election ', '     GE2020 ', '     Singapore politics ']}"

      President Halimah Yacob urges Singaporeans to unite behind newly elected Government
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: President Halimah Yacob has asked Singaporeans to unite behind the newly elected Government and give it their full support to see the country though the COVID-19 crisis.\nSpeaking at the swearing-in ceremony of new office holders at the Istana on Monday (Jul 27), Madam Halimah said she was heartened by how Singaporeans from all walks of life have mobilised resources to help each other in difficult times during the pandemic.\xa0\n“So for this next phase, I ask Singaporeans to similarly unite behind the Government that we have elected, and give it our full support to see Singapore through this crisis,” she said.\nWhile the COVID-19 situation in Singapore has stabilised, the crisis is far from over, said the President.\xa0\n“The Government called a General Election to secure a fresh mandate and a new full term, in order to make the necessary and difficult decisions to deal with the troubled times ahead. Now that the election is over, we must focus on the challenges and the agenda ahead,” she said.\nThe General Election held on Jul 10 was won by the People’s Action Party (PAP) with 61.2 per cent of the popular vote.

      In Focus: A General Election with a 'COVID twist' - how a pandemic may shape a pivotal contest
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: It is inevitable that COVID-19 will be a defining feature of the coming General Election (GE)\xa0– both as a significant campaign\xa0issue and a major factor in how the polls\xa0will be carried out.\nThe massive global healthcare challenge\xa0sparked by a minuscule virus has led to a disruption of the\xa0economy and an unprecedented\xa0“circuit breaker” in Singapore, changing the way people live and\xa0threatening livelihoods.\nThree weeks after exiting the circuit breaker, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Tuesday (Jun 23) called the election, which will be held on Jul 10.\xa0\n“The alternative is to wait out the COVID-19 pandemic. But we have no assurance that the pandemic will be over before this Government’s term must end next April,” Mr Lee\xa0said in an address to the nation.\n""An election now – when things are relatively stable – will clear the decks, and give the new Government a fresh five-year mandate,"" he said. He also said that COVID-19 will be with Singapore for at least a year and most probably longer, until a vaccine is developed and becomes available.\nAnalysts say that a scorecard for the Government\'s handling of the coronavirus outbreak would include items that affect\xa0all areas of people’s lives - and the tally will be\xa0taken in the upcoming GE, already seen by some as the opportunity for the electorate to pass judgement\xa0on the ruling People\'s Action Party’s (PAP) next generation of leaders, dubbed widely as the 4G leadership team.\n""Just like how the previous generations of leaders have had their moments of crisis management, this would definitely mark the leadership capabilities of the 4G leaders,” said political analyst Dr Felix Tan, an associate lecturer at SIM Global Education.\nThose who have been on the front line of the battle to deal with COVID-19 include Deputy Prime Minister and PM-designate Heng Swee Keat, who has seen through four Budgets to cushion the economic effects of the pandemic; Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing, who has headed efforts to secure supply chains and national stockpiles; and National Development Minister Lawrence Wong, who co-chairs the COVID-19 multi-ministry task force, and has been giving the nation regular updates on the virus situation.\nManpower Minister Josephine Teo has also had a central role to play as infections in the migrant worker community spiked in April, while Education Minister Ong Ye Kung had to manage the closure of schools and shift to home-based learning during the circuit breaker.\nPANDEMIC ECONOMICS\nGiven the economic fallout from the pandemic, with unemployment rising, experts agreed that jobs and perennial bread-and-butter issues would likely weigh even more on voters’ minds this election.\n""The key issues we anticipate in the campaign are first, the bread-and-butter issues of jobs, wages, career prospects especially coming out of the global COVID-19 crisis … COVID-19 has brought fresh interest in this issue,” said Dr Gillian Koh, deputy research director at the Institute of Policy Studies.\nThe Government is spending billions to subsidise Singaporean workers’ paychecks, create jobs and retrain workers in successive Budgets, and drawing unprecedented amounts from Singapore\'s national reserves.\nDr Koh said: “We see the incumbent emphasising that it is sparing no effort in ‘protecting workers’ … (but) opposition parties are likely to spell out their views if those plans will be enough and whether there are segments that feel that they have been neglected.”\nCRISIS MANAGEMENT\nA second set of issues would revolve around whether Singapore’s leaders are seen to have got the better of a virus that has left many world leaders foundering.\xa0\nSome, such as Taiwan’s Tsai Ing-Wen, New Zealand’s Jacinda Arden and South Korea’s Moon Jae-In, have boosted confidence in their leadership with their handling of the crisis, with Mr Moon’s Democratic Party scoring a landslide win in April.\nDespite\xa0Singapore’s comparatively\xa0high number of COVID-19 cases, the country has avoided the high death tolls and scenes of overwhelmed hospitals\xa0replayed in many countries around the world.\n""For Singapore, much will ride on how much voters emphasise and assign responsibility for the movement from the supposed ‘gold standard’ of testing and pandemic control earlier in the year to the rapid rise in the number of infections - particularly among migrant workers - that led to the circuit breaker,""\xa0said political science professor Chong Ja Ian.\nIPS’ Dr Koh was of the view that there has been a “remarkable level of engagement, transparency and accountability” in the Government’s handling of the pandemic so far.\n“The multi-ministry task force has been at pains to share what the transmission numbers are, what they are learning about the science to COVID-19, and why the government was taking the measures it did,” she said.\nBut Dr Tan said that there have been questions raised about how the government has attempted to control the spread of the pandemic within the community.\xa0\n“While the government has made tremendous efforts to mitigate this unprecedented crisis, there have been lots of questions about the decision-making process and the measures that the government have had in place during the circuit breaker\xa0phase,” he said.\n“FLIGHT TO SAFETY”?\nAs well as passing judgement on how Singapore has coped with the crisis, voters may also contemplate how\xa0the opposition parties look to exploit COVID-19 as a campaign issue.\xa0\nThat being so, and given the Herculean scope of the crisis, would it benefit the opposition to poke holes in the Government’s COVID-19 response?\nThis is especially as Cabinet Ministers have repeatedly called for unity in the fight against the virus in Parliament and on national broadcasts on Singapore’s COVID-19 future.\nAlthough he has called for a thorough review of the COVID-19 response in the future, Workers’ Party chief Pritam Singh said in Parliament on Jun 5\xa0that the party had refrained from “publicly criticising the Government on its handling of an unprecedented crisis in ways that would undermine the national effort” - highlighting the sensitivities of being perceived as armchair critics.\nAssociate Professor Eugene Tan from the Singapore Management University said that taking on the Government on its handling of COVID-19 is seen as “par for the course”, as long as voters do not perceive their campaigns as undermining national unity.\n“There will be a variety of views of how the outbreak and the economic impact have been handled and voters will like to see the issues aired so that the voters’ concerns and interests are addressed post-election,” he said.\n“It will be foolhardy for any government to say that it has done enough. There will always be gaps, unmet needs, and new issues. I expect the PAP to make the case that it is prepared to do more and that it has the capacity to help Singaporeans overcome the immense challenges that lie ahead.”\nSome observers said that the PAP has already begun campaigning with the recent national broadcasts delivered by key Cabinet Ministers that have dwelled on themes like Singapore’s future post-COVID and the need to strengthen the nation’s social cohesion in a time of crisis.\n“The national broadcasts can be seen as the government\'s attempt to showcase its achievements and also acts as a form of campaigning rally for the government to unite Singaporeans during this period of great uncertainty,” said Dr Felix Tan.\n“It targets Singaporeans\' sense of pragmatism. There will be those who fear that there might be a possibility that a government, besides the PAP\xa0will necessarily lead to a situation that Singapore will never be able to get out of.”\xa0\nThis is why, as much as the opposition can use the COVID-19 as a political weapon, it will most likely be futile, he added.\n“Given how severe this crisis and its ramifications have been, there will be little motivation for a stronger \'alternative\' voice,” he said.\nDr Koh made a similar point, saying that voters worried about the ongoing crisis would be more inclined to support the incumbents in\xa0“flight to safety” effect.\n“They will chose a relatively more experienced team or party than the opposition if they are not sure the latter can make positive contributions to the need to maintain livelihoods and also manage local municipal demands.”\n“COVID-19 TWIST”\nDespite being held in the midst of a global pandemic, the election is unlikely to be reduced to just COVID-19 and related issues, said Assoc Prof Eugene Tan, but the coronavirus will often be the segue into discussing other issues, whether they relate to government accountability, immigration or the costs of living.\n“Opposition parties will not let the issues on the election trail be scoped so narrowly, and voters will also seek an airing from the parties on issues that concern them,” he said.\n“The PAP could pay the price if it is seen as framing the election issues too narrowly. For the opposition, they will also have to be mindful of voters’ concerns as well and not to be seen to be tone-deaf to how COVID-19 is impacting people and businesses.”\nOne issue that has been a theme in the past two General Elections, but has now got a “COVID twist”, is immigration and population growth, said Dr Koh.\n“Opposition parties have been bringing up this issue as an outcome of what happened to foreign workers in the COVID crisis here,” she said, adding that the economic downturn brought on by the crisis may mean fewer foreign workers being hired here.\n“While local workers may suffer, the government provides support for them to companies. Opposition parties will have to engage in the details of these programmes and explain if these provide the security Singaporean workers\xa0seek,” she said.\nBREAK FROM THE PAST\nThe crisis has also led to much talk about a post-COVID Singapore, and a break from the past, which could see\xa0other concerns being aired.\nSaid Assoc Prof Tan: “Other issues such as social inequality, social injustice, climate change (and)\xa0digitalisation’s impact will feature in any conversation on the remaking of Singapore.\n“This might be the first election where material issues (jobs, livelihoods, costs of living) will compete with “post-material issues”, or issues that speak to societal values, for air time … The ‘crisis of a generation’ will certainly spawn a plethora of issues about where Singapore is heading.”\nSocial inequality will feature in any discussion about the economy during the hustings, as would Singapore’s policies toward migrant workers, said Assoc Prof Chong.\xa0\n“In particular, voters will have to decide on whether past approaches to the economy are sufficient for addressing the challenges ahead or if key aspects of Singapore’s way of doing business needs fundamental readjustment to face the emerging circumstances,” he said.\nHe added that social fissures, inequality, reliance on migrant labour and their treatment will affect voters’ lives either directly or indirectly.\n“The pandemic highlights the interconnectedness among these issues and how they really are not separate. This set of issues need to be managed comprehensively, with adequate deliberation and care rather than rushed through under the guise of ‘efficiency’. Haste might not serve anyone well in the end.”\nPOFMA, PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS\nDr Koh said that issues related to freedom of expression, specifically laws that deal with online falsehoods, may arise.\xa0\nThe Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA) came into effect last year despite criticism from some quarters. Directives to label online posts as falsehoods have since been issued to several parties, including opposition politicians and editors of alternative news sites.\xa0\n“This is a vexing set of issues as the balance is between expression and wanting quality debate and ensuring the election process is not undermined by foreign interference,” said Dr Koh.\nWhile eclipsed by COVID-19, POFMA and changes to Presidential Election procedures\xa0are issues that would resonate with voters, added Dr Felix Tan.\n“There has been much unhappiness over how the government has been a little too hasty in rushing through decisions on these two issues,” he added.\nFormer presidential candidate Dr Tan Cheng Bock, who had challenged constitutional changes that led to the 2017 Presidential Elections being reserved for Malay candidates,\xa0is now leading the Progress Singapore Party in its first General Election.\nAssoc Prof Chong said that an underrated issue is the climate crisis: “Many voters usually pay limited attention to environmental issues, but issues like the emergence of new diseases and pandemics relate to environmental degradation. There is a chance that it could become a bigger electoral issue.”\nConducting an election during a pandemic may also result in unforeseen contingencies - such as a major spike in infections and community transmissions during the campaign period or voting, said Assoc Prof Chong.\n“This could affect the results of elections or erode the legitimacy of their results. Much as we would like to avoid such situations, the pandemic has so far proven that it can unleash previously unexpected situations that are challenging to handle,” he said.\n""HOTLY CONTESTED IN THE VIRTUAL REALM""\nThere have been contingency plans made to mitigate the spread of the virus should an election be called, with guidelines issued by the Elections Department this month.\nMuch of the flesh pressing and the drama of mass rallies that defined past elections will be impossible, as gatherings of more than five people are not allowed in Phase 2 of Singapore’s re-opening.\xa0In place of rallies and walkabouts, election candidates will get an average of three minutes of airtime on Channel 5 and livestreaming facilities for online rallies.\n“Political parties and candidates will need to leverage digital campaigning tools more extensively, compared to the past elections,” said Dr Carol Soon, senior research fellow at the Institute of Policy Studies.\n“Irrespective of the party candidates hail from, they will have to contend with information clutter, people’s short attention span, and the lack of physical intimacy and social cues when interacting with their constituencies.”\nExperts disagreed on whether an election carried out largely online will benefit opposition parties or the incumbents, with some saying that less resources will be required to carry out campaigning online, and others commenting that the lack of physical rallies - which have always had far larger turnouts for opposition parties - would be a major disadvantage for\xa0opposition candidates.\nDr Soon said that past research has shown the advantages that bigger political parties have in the real world spill\xa0over to the online world, as they had more funds to conduct more sophisticated forms of digital campaigning. However, the growth of user-generated content and peer-to-peer platforms in the past decade, has levelled the playing field for political parties.\xa0\n“Now, there is an even wider range of low cost and no cost options for election campaigning. They include social networking sites, live videos, instant messaging apps and online meeting platforms,” she said.\n""Creating interactive and compelling content that engages and resonates with the concerns of constituents is mission critical for online campaigning. Parties, big and small, should have dedicated manpower, full-time or on a volunteer basis, to develop and execute an integrated online strategy.""\nFurthermore, the new Constituency Political Broadcasts for all candidates on TV enable political parties to leverage the power of TV, which is one of the most used and trusted media during election time, she added.\nSaid Assoc Prof Eugene Tan: “The election will likely be noticeably quieter in the real world but I expect the campaign to be hotly contested in the virtual realm. So this seeming incongruence is yet another likely feature of a COVID-19 GE.”\nDownload our\xa0app\xa0or join to our Telegram channel for the latest GE2020 updates:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\n', 'related_topics': ['     Singapore politics ', '     Singapore General Election ', '     COVID-19 ', '     In Focus ']}"

      'It's crunch time': Opposition parties react to GE2020 announcement, WP puts up video featuring Nicole Seah
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Several of Singapore\'s opposition parties were quick to respond when Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong called an election on Tuesday (Jun 23) afternoon, with The Workers\' Party (WP) putting up a video on Facebook featuring a slate of fresh faces, as well as a few familiar ones.\xa0\nAfter PM Lee\'s national broadcast, the Elections Department announced that President Halimah Yacob had dissolved Parliament and issued the Writ of Election. Nomination Day is set for Jun 30 and Singapore will go to the polls on Jul 10.\xa0\nWP\'s Facebook post was simply captioned: ""GE2020: Coming Soon.""\nThe video offered brief glimpses of 12 faces in total, including WP chairman Sylvia Lim, organising secretary Dennis Tan, former National Solidarity Party election candidate Nicole Seah and a new face - Ms Raeesah Khan, the founder of non-profit organisation Reyna Movement.\xa0\nAlso spotted:\xa0Ms Lee Li Lian, who is tipped to run in Sengkang GRC, economics professor Jamus Lim, lawyer Fadli Fawzi, Ms Cheryl Loh\xa0and Mr Kenneth Foo, who\xa0contested in Nee Soon GRC in 2015, as well as\xa0youth wing exco member Yudhishthra Nathan.\xa0\nThe last two faces in the video were of Mr\xa0Leon Perera, who heads WP\'s youth wing, and secretary-general Pritam Singh.\nA few prominent party members were not featured, including former chief Low Thia Khiang, former\xa0Aljunied GRC MPs\xa0Chen Show Mao and Faisal Manap, as well as potential candidates Gerald Giam and Yee Jenn Jong.\nMeanwhile, Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) chief Chee Soon Juan put out a Facebook post to confirm he will be running in Bukit Batok SMC and to call for support.\xa0\n""My friends, the Writ of Election has been issued. It’s crunch time. I’ll be doing battle again at Bukit Batok and I hope that you will give me your support as you have all these years,"" he said.\xa0\nSDP chairman Paul Ananth Tambyah accused the ruling People’s Action Party (PAP) of putting its own political wellbeing ahead of Singaporeans’ safety by calling an election in the middle of\xa0the COVID-19 pandemic, but nevertheless said his party was ready to contest the polls.\xa0\n“We have been preparing for early elections for more than a year since our campaign launched in February 2019,” he said in a media release later on Tuesday.\n“The writ has thus come as no surprise and we are ready to present our case to the people of Singapore for a fairer and more just society. We are used to the uneven playing field but this time the PAP has outdone itself by banning rallies, limiting ground campaigns and totally monopolising the state media for broadcasts of their agenda.\n“We can only hope that Singaporeans will be able to see through these machinations to recognise that this is a unique opportunity to send the PAP a message, to deny them a two thirds majority and to make sure that they finally start to listen to the voices of ordinary Singaporeans so a crisis like this is never repeated again.”\nThe Singapore People\'s Party (SPP) said it was looking forward to the election, having earlier announced that it would stand in Potong Pasir and in Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC.\xa0\n""The possibility of a General Election\xa0has been on the cards for some time,"" said SPP chairman\xa0Jose Raymond.\n""In terms of our outreach in Potong Pasir, work began three years ago and we are looking forward to the contest, in an area which we hold close to our hearts.""\nHe added that the party aims to reach out to as many residents as possible, including in Bishan-Toa Payoh, and will conduct campaigning ""given that we aren\'t out of the woods yet in terms of the COVID-19 pandemic"".\nThe Progress Singapore Party, which earlier announced that it would contest eight constituencies,\xa0said on Facebook: ""Progress Singapore Party, under the steady leadership of our Secretary-General Dr Tan Cheng Bock, is ready to serve Singaporeans and fight for the future that we all deserve.""\nThe National Solidarity Party said it welcomed\xa0Mr\xa0Lee\'s call to dissolve\xa0Parliament.\n""This General Election is not just an election to choose a government that can respond to crises\xa0such as COVID-19. But also one that has checks and balances by opposition parties. A government that is responsible, transparent, honest and accountable to Singaporeans. Vote wisely,"" it said on Facebook.\nPeople\'s Power Party chief\xa0Goh Meng Seng contended that Nomination Day should be delayed for overseas candidates to return to Singapore.\n""It should be at least 14 days for potential candidates overseas to make their way back for Nomination Day from today. In view of COVID-19, we should not put our citizens\' health at risk just for this GE,"" he said.\nMr Goh, who led a team to contest Chua Chu Kang GRC in 2015, earlier said that he would be contesting in an SMC this election due to ""some technicality in getting one of our key potential candidates back from overseas"".\nAdditional reporting by Cindy Co and Lydia Lam.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Singapore politics ', '     Singapore General Election ', '     GE2020 ', ""     Workers' Party "", '     WP ', '     Singapore Democratic Party ', '     SDP ', '     Singapore People’s Party ', '     SPP ', '     Progress Singapore Party ', '     PSP ', '     National Solidarity Party ', '     NSP ', '     People’s Power Party ', '     PPP ']}"

  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Workers\' Party (WP) chief Pritam Singh on Sunday night (Jun 21) said that an article written by People\'s Action Party (PAP) Member of Parliament Tan Wu Meng was ""politically motivated"" to divide Singaporeans.\xa0\nIt was Mr Singh\'s first direct response to an opinion piece by Dr Tan Wu Meng\xa0titled Mr Pritam Singh Supports Alfian Sa’at,\xa0which was posted on the PAP website on Jun 19.\xa0\nIn the article, after listing several Facebook posts by\xa0Mr Alfian in which the poet\xa0claimed to support Malaysia, Jurong GRC MP Dr Tan\xa0said: ""I suggest (Mr Singh)\xa0read them carefully, and then tell us if he still thinks Alfian is a \'loving critic\'\xa0of Singapore.\xa0If he does, perhaps Mr Singh considers himself a \'loving critic\'\xa0of Singapore too?""\nMr Singh had made the comments about ""loving critics"" of Singapore\xa0during the debate on the Fortitude Budget in Parliament on Jun 5.\n""LEAP OF LOGIC""Mr Singh\'s initial response to Dr Tan was a brief Facebook post which said: ""A loving critic. A son of Singapore.\xa0Not perfect.

      Potential PAP candidates? Senior public servants step down ahead of General Election
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: With the prospect\xa0of a General Election growing, the recent resignations of a number of senior officials in the public sector have taken on added significance, as in past years, with the expectation that they will stand as People’s Action Party (PAP) candidates.\nSoon to join the growing list of former public servants is chief executive of the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) Tan Kiat How, whose impending movement was announced on Monday.\nAll eyes will now be on these potential candidates who have already been spotted, either on the ground\xa0or engaging residents at community events online.\nPolitical observer\xa0Eugene Tan said that before the “circuit breaker” the PAP focused on “soft introducing” potential candidates from the private sector. As the election draws nearer, candidates who are formerly from the public sector are now in the spotlight.\n""The public sector, including the military, remains a favourite ‘hunting’ ground for the PAP,”\xa0said the Associate Professor of Law from Singapore Management University. “However, we can expect more candidates from the private sector this time. Anecdotally, it would appear that the candidates with a private sector background will outnumber the public sector ones.\n""The preference for candidates with some public sector experience and expertise remains strong for the PAP, especially for those earmarked for political appointments after being elected.""\nPolitical analyst and SIM Global Education associate lecturer Felix Tan said there appears to be\xa0""no huge deviation"" from the PAP\'s pre-election modus operandi this time.\n""This has always been a tried and tested formula that the PAP can\xa0rely on,"" he said. ""They have the necessary competence and experience in the public service, which will be important in the running of the governmental bureaucracy. So, it comes as no surprise that the PAP will once again tap on such resources.""\nHere’s a look at the potential candidates and where they may be contesting:\nTAN KIAT HOW, 43, OUTGOING CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF IMDA\nMr Tan is stepping down as chief executive of IMDA\xa0on Jun 20.\xa0\nIn response to CNA\'s queries, the outgoing chief executive said on Monday (Jun 15) that he will be taking ""a short break"".\n""My plans are still being firmed up. It would be premature to share them now,"" said Mr Tan, adding that he\xa0and his wife are expecting their first child in August.\n""I would like to spend time with her and prepare for the baby’s arrival.”\nMr Tan was appointed IMDA\'s chief executive in January 2017 to lead the merger of what was the Infocomm Development Authority and the then-Media Development Authority to form IMDA.\nHe has been engaging residents in East Coast during recent webinars on digitalisation. On Jun 13, he was a guest speaker in a webinar for East Coast GRC residents and on Jun 6, he was a panellist in a webinar hosted by Member of Parliament Lee Yi Shyan, who oversees Kampong Chai Chee in the GRC.\nIn the Jun 6 webinar, Mr Tan said: “Kampong Chai Chee is very close to my heart, every weekend I’m at Block 216 market. In fact, this morning I was just there tabao-ing (buying takeaway) peanut pancakes for my parents.”\nMr Lee, along with former Manpower Minister Lim Swee Say, are the two incumbent MPs from East Coast who are expected to leave the GRC. East Coast GRC, which the Workers’ Party contested in the last election, was the GRC where PAP had its closest winning margin in GE2015.\nDESMOND TAN KOK MING, 49, FORMER PEOPLE’S ASSOCIATION (PA) CHIEF EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR\nMr Tan stepped down as PA chief on Jun 15, after a stint of three-and-a-half years. \xa0Mr Tan led PA’s ground operations as part of the whole-of-government COVID-19 response, said PA in announcing his departure.\nBefore joining PA, he was a brigadier-general and his last appointment was Chief of Staff of the General Staff in the army.\nMr Tan was tagged on May 31 by Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean, anchor minister for Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC, in a Facebook post which said that they had a meeting with 150 activists from Punggol.\nPasir Ris-Punggol, one of two GRCs with six seats, shrank to become a five-member GRC with the release of the Electoral Boundaries report in March. It was contested by the Singapore Democratic Alliance in the last election.\nGAN SIOW HUANG, 45, FORMER REPUBLIC OF SINGAPORE AIR FORCE BRIGADIER-GENERAL\nMs Gan was promoted to the rank of brigadier-general in 2015, becoming the Singapore Armed Forces’ (SAF) first female general.\nWhen she resigned from the SAF in March, she held the position of Chief of Staff-Air, and she is now the deputy chief executive of e2i, the employment and employability institute under the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC). She is also chief commissioner of the Girl Guides Singapore.\nIn March, she was spotted in Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC with Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen, who is the GRC’s lead minister. She has also been distributing masks and food to residents there.\nBishan-Toa Payoh, which currently has five MPs, will become\xa0a four-member GRC in the upcoming election after part of the it was carved out to form Marymount SMC.

He is now with NTUC.\nOn Mar 22, Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong, who helms Marine Parade GRC, posted a photo of himself with Mr Fahmi, former IHH Healthcare CEO Dr Tan See Leng, Mountbatten MP Lim Biow Chuan and MacPherson MP Tin Pei Ling.\n“My dream team for West Coast GRC or anywhere,” he wrote.\nLast month, Mr Fahmi\xa0was also out and about with Speaker of Parliament Tan Chuan-Jin, another MP\xa0from Marine Parade GRC.\nMarine Parade GRC, which was contested by the Workers’ Party in 2015, has had part of it hived off to Potong Pasir SMC but remains a five-member GRC.\nNG LING LING, 48, FORMER SENIOR OFFICIAL AT MINISTRY OF HEALTH\nMs Ng, who was Her World\'s Woman of the Year in 2018, left the health ministry’s Office for Healthcare Transformation (MOHT) in March. She is now a consultant for MOHT, the Straits Times reported.\nShe joined the National Council of Social Service in 2001 from the banking sector, and had\xa0led the Community Chest from 2013 to 2018.\nShe is to be the speaker for a Zoom webinar with Jalan Kayu residents on Jun 20 hosted by Ang Mo Kio GRC MP Intan Mokhtar, who has been introducing Ms Ng to residents online.\xa0\nMs Ng was at Ms Intan’s virtual Meet-the-People session on Jun 11, and has been part of other Zoom sessions for residents in the area. She is also the co-chairman of the Social & Financial Resilience Committee of Ang Mo Kio GRC and Sengkang West SMC Grassroots Organisations.\nAng Mo Kio GRC is the other six-member GRC to be downsized to five members.

However, putting out the guidelines early would mean that there could be further changes, as the COVID-19 situation evolves,"" it said.\xa0\n""As COVID-19 is likely to still be present beyond April 2021, by which time the GE must be held, we strongly encourage candidates and political parties to plan for modes of campaigning that minimise large group gatherings,"" it added.\xa0\nSDP said in a statement on Monday night that the uncertainty over the rules for campaigning\xa0is a ""clear demonstration that the COVID-19 spread is still very much not under control"".\n""Elections in Singapore have always provided PAP maximum exposure and the opposition minimum reach to the electorate. This GE, widely predicted to be held in July, will make the gap even wider,"" said SDP.\nThe opposition party\xa0repeated a number of recommendations it had put forward two weeks ago, with the addition of another proposal to extend the period between the issuing of the Writ of Election and Nomination Day from five to 10\xa0days.\n""This will allow parties to organise our campaigns and make the necessary logistical preparations including safety equipment for volunteers and polling agents. This is especially important if the ELD only announces the election rules following the issuance of the Writ,"" said SDP.\nELD had said that in the ""worst case scenario"", full campaign guidelines will be made known when the Writ of Election is issued.\xa0Nomination Day has to\xa0be at least five days but not later than one month from the date\xa0the Writ is issued.\nThe other SDP proposals are to provide 21 days for the official campaign period instead of the current nine,\xa0to\xa0give all parties access to the Mediacorp TV channels every night, over and above the traditional political broadcasts, and to provide all parties access to radio programmes every day.\nIt also suggested to reserve column space in newspapers for parties to publish their\xa0manifestos as well as discuss their ideas or proposals, and to allow parties to address residents at food centres, void decks and common areas subject\xa0to safety social distancing rules.\nELD had\xa0said on Monday that\xa0measures to ensure voters have access to the campaigning messages of political parties and candidates will be put in place\xa0should large group activities be restricted. This may include additional TV broadcast time for candidates and political parties.\nSaid SDP: ""This election, quite unlike others in the past, will require Singaporeans to be even more actively and intensely engaged.

      What are the COVID-19 safety measures for Polling Day? Here’s what voters need to know
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: The Elections Department (ELD) has issued contingency plans on how the next General Election (GE) will be held amid the COVID-19 outbreak.\nSafety measures include dedicated time-bands for seniors to vote, setting up more polling stations and having voters wear gloves before entering polling booths.\nAbout 2.65 million Singaporeans are expected to head to the polls on Jul\xa010, and all 93 parliamentary seats are contested in this election.\nHere’s what you need to know to vote safely:\nBEFORE LEAVING YOUR HOUSE\n\xa0- Check the recommended time for voting allotted to you. Voters will be given a recommended two-hour voting time-band, which will be indicated on the poll card and e-Poll card on the SingPass mobile app. This is to spread out voters across polling hours.\n- Senior voters aged 65 and above will be allotted recommended\xa0voting time-bands from 8am to noon. Senior voters who require assistance may be accompanied by one household member. Senior voters who are unable to vote during their allotted time-bands in the morning can still do so at other times of the day when\xa0they will be able to join priority queues.\n- Can’t make your slot? While voters are encouraged to\xa0stick to their allotted time-bands, they may vote at any time the polling stations are open. Younger voters who show up in the morning may have to wait longer, says ELD.\xa0\n- For about 400 polling stations with fewer senior voters,\xa0younger voters have been assigned morning hours (from 10am to 12pm), after seniors vote in the early morning.\n- The number of polling stations will increase - from 880\xa0to\xa01,100. This will cut the average number of voters per polling station from 3,000 to 2,400.\n- Use http://VoteQ.gowhere.gov.sg to check the queue situation before setting off to vote. Voters should not bring non-voters, such as children, to polling stations.\nREGISTERING TO VOTE\n-\xa0Bring your original valid NRIC/passport as well as the\xa0Poll Card or ePoll Card to facilitate checks by election officials.\n- All voters will be screened for fever and respiratory symptoms at the start of the queue.\xa0\n- Those with a fever of 37.5 degrees Celsius or above have to vote during a special voting hour of 7pm to 8pm. Those on stay-home notices at home also have to vote at this time.\xa0\n- Other voters are advised to avoid this hour, but will be allowed to vote if they turn up then.\n-\xa0e-Registration\xa0means\xa0machines, not humans, will verify voters against the electoral roll at polling stations. This eliminates contact with election\xa0officials.\xa0\n- Voters must\xa0wear face masks and should lower them\xa0only when election officials need to verify their identity.\n- Unlike polling agents and candidates, voters need not\xa0use the SafeEntry app to check in and check out. The e-Registration system records when voters register at the polling station and can be used for contact tracing if necessary.\nAT THE POLLING STATION AND\xa0VOTING\xa0\n- Voters are to stay 1m away from others while waiting to enter polling stations and within polling stations.\n- They need to sanitise their hands and wear disposable gloves before receiving a ballot paper. After voting, they are to dispose of their gloves at the exit.\n- This will minimise the risk of contaminating the self-inking “X” pen, which will be used by other voters or ballot papers, which will be handled by counting assistants.\n- Voters may also bring their own pens to mark the ballot papers.\n- Cleaners will be deployed to clean common touch-points, such as polling booths and self-inking “X” pens, within the polling area at least once every half hour. After polls close, cleaners will thoroughly disinfect the polling stations.\n- Five minutes - the amount of time a voter should spend at a polling station. This includes registration, hand sanitisation, wearing of gloves and\xa0voting, ELD says.\n- Polling hours are from 8am to 8pm.\nSPECIAL VOTING HOUR\n- Those found to have a fever and on stay-home notices at home can only vote between 7pm to 8pm.\n- There will be no temperature screening, since voters with fever are allowed to vote during the special voting hour.\n- A smaller team of election officials at every polling station\xa0will don full personal protective equipment.\n- Cleaners will sanitise the polling equipment\xa0after each voter’s use.\nOTHER MEASURES\n- COVID-19 patients and those in quarantine will not be allowed to vote.\n- Voters on stay-home notices at designated facilities will vote at special polling stations away from other voters.\n- Five special polling stations have been gazetted at Marina Bay Sands (four)\xa0and Marriott South Beach (one). Any additional ones will be published on Jul 7.\n- All such voters\xa0will remain in their room, and a mobile polling team will go to them.\n- ELD urged voters who are unwell not to vote. After the election, they can apply to be restored to the register of electors without paying a S$50 penalty.\xa0\n- Overseas voting at the 10 overseas polling stations will proceed subject to the approval of the overseas authorities and the prevailing COVID-19 situation in those cities.\n- The cities are Beijing, Canberra, Dubai, Hong Kong, London, New York, San Francisco, Shanghai, Tokyo and Washington. They will implement similar safety measures to polling stations in Singapore.\nWHERE CAN YOU FIND INFORMATION?\n- To check your constituency,\xa0polling station and allotted time, you can look at the Poll Card,\xa0ePoll Card or go to the ELD website.\xa0\n- ELD will be airing videos on how to vote safely on TV in four languages and four dialects.\n- A shorter version of the video will also be played online.\n- There will be posters at HDB notice boards and community clubs as well as print ads in newspapers.\n-\xa0VeLDA, a web assistant, can address voters' queries in Malay, Mandarin, Tamil, Cantonese, Hakka, Hainanese, Hokkien and Teochew.\nOTHER REMINDERS TO VOTERS\n- Mark your choice of vote in demarcated area on ballot paper.\xa0Marks made outside demarcated area will be disregarded.\n- Do not take photographs or videos in the voting area - this is to safeguard voting secrecy.\n- Smoking is not allowed within the polling station.\n- Avoid bringing big bags which will require security checks and cause delays.\n- There will be no parking of vehicles within/near polling stations, but drop-offs and pick-ups are allowed for those with mobility issues.\nThis story was first published on Jun 8\xa0and updated on Jul 1 to reflect the latest announcements from the Elections Department.\nDownload our app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates: https://cna.asia/telegram\n\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Singapore General Election ', '     Singapore politics ', '     COVID-19 ']}"

      Former PSP members file application to form new political party Red Dot United
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Former members of the Progress Singapore Party (PSP), Mr Ravi Philemon and Ms Michelle Lee, have filed an application to form a new political party named Red Dot United.\nA group of like-minded individuals aged from 25 to 55 have come together to form the new party, said Mr Philemon in a virtual press conference on Friday (May 29). Mr Philemon will be the secretary-general of the party, while Ms Lee will be the chairman. \xa0\nThere are more than 10\xa0people in the group that filed the application to form the party, some of whom are former members of other political parties. Besides\xa0Ms Lee and Mr Philemon, two others are former PSP members, Mr Philemon said.\nMs Lee quit as vice-chairman of PSP in March, citing family commitments while Mr Philemon resigned on May 12. Before joining PSP, Ms Lee was once part of the Singapore Democratic Party and had contested in the 2011 GE.\nMr Philemon, who ran as a member of the Singapore People’s Party in the 2015 elections, said that he had been planning to start a political platform for “many years” but when\xa0PSP was formed, he put his plans on hold to join Dr Tan Cheng Bock’s party. However, after some time, they decided to “part ways amiably”.\n“As to why we left PSP, it is possible that we asked too many questions,” he added.\nSaid Ms Lee of the new party members: “These are people who reached out to us, to ask us about future plans, and in the discussion of going ahead with this, they expressed a lot of enthusiasm and support. We wish PSP the best, we are not trying to pull people over.”\nHe indicated that many of the party members are below 35 years old and they will focus on engaging youths. The members include professionals and business owners, Mr Philemon added.\nWhen asked why they did not want to join an existing political party, Ms Lee said: “There\'s a need for a new perspective, new ideas and new methods to be brought into this space.""\nMr Philemon also said in a statement to the media that their goal is to ""build a political-social platform and not just another political party"".\n""Red Dot United will be present, not only in times of general elections, but also in the years in between them. \xa0We will work for change on the ground with our fellow Singaporeans, to enable thought leadership and active citizen participation in the decisions and plans that affect our lives and the path of our nation,"" he said.\nHe\xa0indicated that the party, whose registration has yet to be approved, is interested in working with other political parties.\n“We have also spoken to some other party leaders in the opposition space and will always seek to build each other and fellow Singaporeans up,” he said.\nIn response to CNA\'s queries, a Ministry of Home Affairs spokesperson said on Sunday that the Registry of Societies received the application to register Red Dot United on May 26.\xa0\n""The average processing time for a registration application is about two months.\xa0The Registry of Societies is not able to provide any other information about the application,"" said the spokesperson.\n“After a couple of weeks we intend to write into the registrar societies to request for them to expedite our application,” said Mr Philemon.\nSingapore has to hold its next General Election by April 14, 2021. There have been signs that the polls may be called soon.\nDeputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat had said last week that the elections are coming nearer by the day.\n""The sooner we get it done, the earlier we can rally everybody together to deal with these very significant challenges ahead, and also to deal with these very significant uncertainties in the months and years ahead,"" he had said on Wednesday.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Singapore politics ', '     Singapore General Election ', '     Progress Singapore Party ']}"

      Members resigning, expelled 'no big deal' for Progress Singapore Party: Tan Cheng Bock
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Progress Singapore Party (PSP) secretary-general Tan Cheng Bock on Thursday (May 21) addressed recent reports of members who had resigned or were expelled, saying that their departures were ""no big deal"" to the one-year-old opposition party.\nThere have been people with ""big egos"" who joined PSP out of self-interest, instead of contributing to Singapore\'s development, said Dr Tan in an outreach session streamed live on Facebook on Thursday night.\n""I believe in giving everybody a chance to join our party,"" Dr Tan said during the video conference.\n""Over time, we realised that some joined expecting what the party can do for them ... We want the people, when they come and join the PSP, to do something for the country and not for themselves.""\nThere have been reports of two members resigning and another two members expelled from PSP in the last two months.\nAmong them are Mr Ravi Philemon, who resigned from the party last week and former vice-chairman Michelle Lee who left the party in March. Former party member Daniel Teo was expelled from PSP earlier this month, as was former member Jan Chan in March.\nResponding to a question from the public on the seemingly “high” turnover of PSP members, Dr Tan said: “If those people who come in to join the PSP, hoping to extract something from the party for themselves, I think even if they leave, I will not feel sorry.”\n\nDr Tan said\xa0that there were some party members who had ""big egos"" and believed that their way of doing things was the ""only correct way"".\n“But we have party discipline. We have party ways for allowing people to come and express their disappointments and dissatisfaction.”\n“But when they have big egos, it is very difficult. When their egos get hurt, they react very negatively,” he said.\nHe also said that PSP has more than 1,000 members,\xa0and having between 20 and 30 people resign was “no big deal”.\n""To me, it\'s no big deal. Currently, there are so many waiting to join us,"" said Dr Tan in a session where he also appealed to viewers to join the party.\nBesides Dr Tan, eight\xa0members of the party also answered questions from the public in a Zoom meeting to reach out to\xa0residents in the west of Singapore.\nThey included assistant secretary-general Leong Mun Wai, vice-chairwoman Hazel Poa and\xa0PSP members such as workplace safety senior trainer Abas Kasmani, marketing executive\xa0Jeffrey Khoo, lawyer Wendy Low\xa0and law undergraduate Choo Shaun Ming – who at 22 years old is the youngest on the panel.\nDr Tan also said that while PSP has been through ""a lot of pain"", it has learned\xa0from the challenges it faced\xa0and grown in the process.\n""Any young political party has to go through this, even the PAP (People\'s Action Party) when they started, there was a lot of infighting, there were a lot of problems. But they overcame it.""\nThe PSP was established in March last year.\nSingapore Management University law don Eugene Tan said the recent developments at PSP can be seen as “growing pains of the newest kid of the block”.\n“The jostling for influence within the party is not unexpected and par for the course as the party firms up its line-up of candidates, its choice of constituencies to contest in, and the party\'s overall electoral strategy,” he said.\n""It appears that the jostling was rather intense, extending to some members engaging in inappropriate means to further their goals.""\nOn May 12, Mr Philemon quit after being implicated in a video made by a former PSP member, who claimed that the party had received foreign funding. The PSP member who made the video, Mr Teo, was expelled from the party on May 1 and PSP has refuted the allegations.\nPolice reports were made over the video and Mr Teo issued public apologies to Mr Philemon and other opposition politicians mentioned in the video.\nIn March, Mr Chan\xa0was reported to the police after posting religiously insensitive comments on Facebook and was later expelled by the party.\nFormer vice-chairman Ms Lee\xa0resigned in March. The party said in a statement then that she had left to spend more time with her family\xa0and refuted rumours that Ms Lee was asked to leave.\nPolitical analyst Gillian Koh said that such developments can be seen as a “natural process” that takes place with new political parties.\n“When the Reform Party was first formed, there was a similar pattern of people joining and then people leaving especially as the General Election in 2011 drew near,” she said.\nBack in 2011, the party headed by Mr Kenneth Jeyaretnam saw a mass resignation of nine members, including current PSP vice-chairwoman\xa0Ms Poa. The former civil servant in the Administrative Service contested under the National Solidarity Party (NSP) in 2011 and once headed NSP, but quit before the 2015 General Election.\nDr Koh said there will also be members who join to “get a feel of the leadership and their political positions”.\nShe added that the issues of discipline, with police reports made, were quite unusual, but that the expulsions could also be put down to PSP being a young party: “It is a balance between growth and control, and the need for establishing norms and codes of discipline.\n“In the PSP case, some former members are known entities, and others, fresh faces. This means it is more difficult for the party leadership to establish what their backgrounds are, how competent they are, or, in the realm of more sinister scenarios and possibilities, how trustworthy they might be.”\nSome of those who joined PSP, such as Ms Lee and Ms Poa, were former members of other opposition parties, while some were new to politics – including Mr Teo.\nHowever, such negative news could still result in “some liability to the PSP brand”, she said.\nOn the flip side, the party has been swift and consistent in dealing with cases of party discipline, said Assoc Prof Tan.\xa0\n""That has done much to reduce damage to the PSP. In fact, it may even be regarded as good handling of potentially debilitating issues for a new party,""\xa0he said.\nPolitical observer Derek da\xa0Cunha told CNA that while the\xa0expulsions and resignations “do not have a good look” for the PSP, it is still too early to say if they will be of significance at the ballot box.\n""Between now and when the poll actually takes place, any number of events can intervene to shift the electoral advantage one way or another,""\xa0he said.\xa0\n""The main concern of the vast majority of Singaporeans has always been their material well-being. To what extent would their material well-being have declined – in terms of retrenchments, a sizeable cut in wages, and actual or paper losses in investments – under the weight of the COVID-19 pandemic even if circuit breaker restrictions have eased or are fully lifted, will be a key factor in the upcoming General Election.""\nSingapore\'s next election has to be called by Apr 14, 2021.\nEditor\'s Note: An earlier version of this story said that “in 2011, the party founded by Mr Kenneth Jeyaretnam saw a mass resignation”. This is incorrect. It should have been the party “headed” by Mr Kenneth Jeyaretnam. We apologise for the error.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Singapore politics ', '     Progress Singapore Party ']}"

      Commentary: 2019 – a year for political consolidation or a year for elections?
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Political watchers had eyes on Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat’s Budget speech on Monday (Feb 18) for one key indicator: Whether with strategic handouts, it would signal elections this year.\nTwo blockbuster announcements were eventually made: The much-awaited Merdeka Generation Package worth S$8 billion, and the Bicentennial Bonus worth S$1.1 billion. The jury is still out as to whether taken together, both provided any definitive signal of intent.\nThere is also the question of the healthy surplus of S$15 billion that this term of government has been projected to generate by the end of FY2019.\nCould this then signal elections later - in 2020 - as some have suggested? The implication here being that the surpluses could be spent on handouts next year.\nTo this, Mr Heng said: “It is not about ‘we are near the election so let’s spend this, let’s spend that’ … (and) it doesn’t mean that next year (2020), we are going to spend that S$15 billion.”\nHe could not have been expected to say very much different.\nUltimately, in divining whether a general election might be called this year or next, ahead of the mandated deadline of April 2021, a blinkered focus on the Budget could prove myopic.\nMore appropriate hints could instead be found from examining the political imperatives of the People’s Action Party (PAP).\nIn this regard, it is likely that the PAP will use 2019 as a year for consolidation, rather than as a year it seeks a fresh mandate.\nCONSOLIDATING BEHIND THE LEADERSHIP OF HENG SWEE KEAT\nMr Heng only took on the post of first assistant secretary-general of the PAP in November 2018, and with it, the mantle of presumptive prime minister.\nIn the months since, small steps have been taken to hint that he is growing into a larger role\xa0with larger responsibilities.\nOn Dec 31, 2018, Mr Heng travelled\xa0together with DPM Teo Chee Hean\xa0to Putrajaya as emissaries\xa0on behalf of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, to convey a message to Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. It was a significant signal, especially given that their\xa0meeting provided the impetus for foreign ministers from both sides to ultimately meet the following week for talks on brewing bilateral issues.\nDomestically, in response to an editorial in Chinese daily Lianhe Zaobao, it was Mr Heng who responded for the Government, to what he saw as questions on whether the Government had gone soft and slack.\nMr Heng has clearly started on an accelerated transition. The question is whether this is just the beginning, and whether more time may still be needed.\nWith recent episodes such as the massive cybersecurity breach at SingHealth, the ongoing fallout with the leak of data from Singapore’s HIV Registry\xa0and the spate of training-related deaths in the Singapore Armed Forces, there is still much for Mr Heng and his team of fourth-generation (4G) leaders\xa0to address and set right before polls are called.\nIndeed, as much as the public looks to Mr Heng to progressively exercise his leadership and influence in dealing with recent lapses, the next prime minister will also benefit from having as much time as needed to work with, shape and make his mark on the team that he will take over once PM Lee steps down.\nAs it stands, all eyes are on the Cabinet reshuffle expected in April. Only then will the Government take its longer-term shape, with Mr Heng likely to be elevated to Deputy Prime Minister, and current DPMs Teo Chee Hean and Tharman Shanmugaratnam making way for younger leaders to step up across the Cabinet.\nEspecially since this will be a Cabinet for the future, the imperative will be for Mr Heng to work with Prime Minister Lee on the reshuffle, and thereafter provide sufficient runway for each minister in a new portfolio to build on his or her policy chops.\xa0\nThe intention must be for Mr Heng to take over a team of ministers that is stable and has had sufficient experience. In particular, if younger ministers are identified to eventually take over key portfolios such as finance and transport, the rest of 2019 will be an important period for consolidation.\nELECTORAL CONSIDERATIONS\nSome of the most important considerations for when polls may be called, however, could boil down to the mechanics of political transition.\nFirst, anchor ministers in three group representation constituencies (GRCs) retired from Cabinet in the last reshuffle – Mr Lim Swee Say (East Coast GRC), Mr Lim Hng Kiang (West Coast GRC) and Dr Yaacob Ibrahim (Jalan\xa0Besar GRC). Their positions as leaders in the GRCs will need to be filled.\nSecond, there are other gaps, for example\xa0in Marsiling-Yew Tee, where the PAP lost the senior figure of Mdm Halimah Yaacob, when she resigned to run for President. Arguably, Marine Parade GRC could itself do with a sitting anchor minister, following the election of Mr Tan Chuan-Jin as Speaker of Parliament.\nThird, and potentially most importantly, the next GE will see more GRCs\xa0and more single-member constituencies (SMCs) contested. Not only will the PAP have to identify more senior leaders to helm smaller three-member GRCs, it is likely that competitive SMCs will also have to see more senior party leaders take charge.\nThe question now\xa0is whether with these considerations, and potentially more retirements in the works, the PAP could in fact do with more time to blood junior ministers, test out newer leaders in each constituency, as well as\xa0complete its current cycle of recruitment and renewal.\nUltimately, only the PAP will know how ready it is for hustings.\nFor now, for the pundits who may read the tea leaves on when the GE may eventually be called, the consolidation of the PAP’s leadership transition and electoral calculations should weigh as much, if not more than how it uses the tools in the government purse.\nPrime Minister Lee has said that he would like to step down by the time he turns 70.\nThe year in question is 2022.\nThere is more than enough time for this 4G team to use 2019 to focus on consolidation.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Heng Swee Keat ', '     Lee Hsien Loong ', '     Singapore politics ']}"
