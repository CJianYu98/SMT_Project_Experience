      Commentary: Singapore, don’t let this World Cup lesson go to waste
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The dream was nearly complete, the quest for the greatest World Cup result of all time nearly accomplished. In a tournament ruled by underdogs, a pup of a country - not yet 27 years old - hoofed, hared and hustled to the very last, only to fall short against a supremely gifted French outfit.\nEven then Croatia refused to stay down, as has been their story for the last five weeks in Russia, and what a narrative it was. Back home their small and declining population continue to suffer the effects of economic and political uncertainty, with a football federation awash in corruption scandals that have directly impacted players - including one now recognised as the best at the World Cup, Luka Modric.\nLike many of his teammates, the captain was made a refugee during the Balkan War, after rebels\xa0torched his house and executed his relatives. But Modric and his cohorts flourished partially because of such challenges, not in spite of them. And at the World Cup, their indefatigable nature came to the fore in group matches I had the fortune of witnessing in person, through three straight gruelling knockout games which stretched into extra time, and all the way to the final itself.\nHere their legs burned and chests hurt but having known worse pain, they pushed and pressed to keep their dream alive, far past the limits of their abilities, until one goal behind became two became three became the end of the line.\nCroatia did not learn to do this from an elaborate blueprint presented on animated powerpoint slides. They did not practise this on stylishly-pruned grounds of a fancy million-dollar facility. This was as basic a football - and sporting - principle as it gets: Team work, hard work, pure and simple, pays off.\nHEY SINGAPORE, DO YOU EVEN DO SPORTS?\nIt would appear this message has not been lost on Singaporean fans, both hardcore and casual. Throughout the competition, Croatia’s gutsy displays have won online hearts in the thousands, and at a public viewing party for the final I overheard plenty of keywords like “determined” and “fighting spirit” every time a checkered red-and-white shirt threw himself at the ball.\nAll of which has made me wonder: Why can’t we convert this consumption, this awareness into advancing Singapore’s football and sporting culture?\nHold up first - do we have one? Let’s bring it back to our de facto national sport. Parents who want their kids to make a career out of football - few and far between. Void deck and street soccer court culture - fast disappearing, if not disappeared. Youth academies - forced to relocate after residential complaints about noise.\xa0\nOh, and there’s that national team stuck in a loop of damnation.\nAll this, while Singaporeans sit glued to their couches, devouring football in the EPL and other European football divisions every weekend, and the World Cup every four years.\nHigh-quality, first-rate sporting spectacle taking place not halfway across the world, but on a screen in front of you: Is this not how all athletes - from weekend warriors to professionals to greats - are influenced and inspired, too?\nI’m no footballer, but football is how I started. Arsenal vs Man Utd on the telly, with the imperious Patrick Vieira - Vicks patch and all - storming from box to box, just running and going at it hard, just doing whatever it takes to propel his side to victory, just like the Croats of today.\nWatching him, I wanted to kick about with the other kids downstairs, so I started jogging to improve my stamina, got hooked on endurance sport, joined kayak racing as a CCA, then rode the endorphin wave into the national squad for dragon boat and later, rowing.\nThis is, in essence, about loving sport, a journey that can start in a living room and be nudged along by supportive parents, PE teachers and the like. Because in the absence of a dedicated sports ministry and the rapid dissolving of local sports media, the onus is truly on us, the people, to kickstart a genuine sporting culture.\nHow we respond to the news of the day matters, too. Take the unfolding Ben Davis\xa0saga: Enough with the finger-pointing and blame-laying, there are only so many instances where online outcry brought actual change.\nThe best response, I feel, is to take real action - get out there and kick a ball, get your kids to kick a ball, and don’t stop until Singapore has a critical mass of footballers doing well enough to warrant a change of deferment criteria.\nIt will take time but we are young, not even as young as a certain World Cup finalist, and the years can be used to slowly wean mindsets to embrace a more conducive attitude and ambition when it comes to sport.\nTake one argument on the Davis situation which I came across on Twitter. It lost me from the get-go using phrases such as “not a guarantee” and “return on investment”, but regained my attention with the claim that Davis’ chances of playing in the EPL are “romantically dreamy”.\nI’m sorry but football, and sport, is all about dreaming - and the keeping on of dreaming. Just ask Croatia.\n', 'related_topics': ['     World Cup ', '     Croatia ', '     sports ']}"

      Commentary: Overhydrating presents health hazards for young athletes
  </h1>, 'text': 'MICHIGAN: Every coach’s favourite cheer is “stay hydrated” and “keep urine clear” during the\xa0heat.\nIn 2017, a University of Texas football coach created a urine-based “Longhorn Football Hydration Chart,” which labelled players with yellow urine as “selfish teammates” and those with brown urine as “bad guys.”\nThis “hydration shaming” practice has permeated high school sports, thereby encouraging a sporting culture which equates superior performance with superior hydration.\nOverzealous obedience to this advice has uncovered a dark underbelly to superior hydration practices: Overhydration.\nWhen high school football player Walker Wilbanks died in Mississippi in August 2014 from overhydration, the doctor said that the cause of death was an “unpredictable freak occurrence"".\nTwo weeks prior, another high school football player from Georgia drank “two gallons of water and two gallons of Gatorade” after football practice to prevent muscle cramps and then died.\nThus, over the last four years, two high school football players have died during August football practice from overhydrating – a medical condition known as exercise-associated hyponatremia.\nConversely, no football player has ever been known to die from dehydration, although seven died during this same four-year period from heatstroke, which may be related, but not always.\nI watched runners almost die after drinking 100 cups of water during a marathon because they were scared of becoming “dehydrated.” So, I got interested in thirst.\nTurns out, the neuroendocrine thirst circuit dates back 700 million years and is found in most animals, including bugs and worms. Thirst activates the same conscious area of the brain that tells us we’re hungry or have to pee.\nTo say we need to stay “ahead of thirst” (or die) is like saying we need to pee every hour to stay ahead of imminent bladder explosion (or die). The molecular and neural circuits that govern fluid intake (and micturition) in real-time are absolutely exquisite.\nIt’s remarkable to think that animals survive without water bottles and urine charts – they drink when they are thirsty, and we should too.\nTOO MUCH WATER, TOO LITTLE SALT\nHyponatremia is caused by drinking too much water or sports drinks, which dilutes blood salt levels below the normal range. Any sudden drop in blood salt levels, from drinking more than the body can excrete, can cause all cells in the body to swell.\nBrain swelling from hyponatremia can cause headaches and vomiting, while muscle cell swelling can trigger whole-body muscle cramping.\nWhat is most frightening, however, is that these symptoms mimic those of dehydration that they are often treated by medical staff with more fluids.\nSo, which hydration imbalance – dehydration and overhydration – is the lesser of two evils?\nDehydration is undeniably harmful to human health and performance. Wrestlers have died from trying to “make weight,” through vigorous dehydration practices.\nA recent meta-analysis of 33 studies verified that more than 2 per cent dehydration impairs cognition.\nDehydration can impair performance and increase core body temperature, as per the American College of Sports Medicine’s latest position statement. All of these statements underscore the vital importance of staying hydrated.\nBut I fear that many coaches ignore the finer points that support those conclusions.\nFor example, three wrestlers who died of dehydration rapidly lost about 15 per cent of body weight by withholding fluids while exercising in a hot environment in a rubber suit. Similarly, to achieve 3 per cent dehydration, which impairs cognition, individuals need to withhold fluids for 24 hours. And that’s without exercise.\nThese dehydration protocols do not necessarily represent “free-living” situations. When hikers die from dehydration in the desert, most if not all had become lost or had run out of fluids.\nThus, thirst – or the “deep-seated desire for water” – is rarely “broken” when healthy people die from dehydration.\nMorbidity and mortality occur when there is no fluid available, fluids are withheld, as in lab studies, or when athletes refuse to drink for other reasons, such as “making weight.”\nHOW MUCH IS ENOUGH WATER? \nSo how much fluid should sports professionals – and all other humans for that matter – drink?\nIf you ask fluid balance experts who perform basic science research on the brain or kidney, or clinicians who specialise in fluid balance disorders, researchers who perform brain scans on dehydrated and overhydrated humans, or even worm investigators, they all agree that water balance is tightly regulated and that all land mammals need to drink when thirsty.\nDrinking when you are thirsty is not “too late,” because the thirst mechanism is hardwired into the nervous system to protect against scarcity.\nThirst represents the highly individualised signal which protects the balance between water and salt regardless of size, activity or ambient temperature and is encoded in most invertebrate and all vertebrate DNA. Babies are born with this innate behavioural drive.\nThen, what about the need for eight glasses of water per day? There is no evidence to support this.\nWhat about peeing until our urine is clear? Dark coloured urine merely reflects water conservation by the kidney, rather than water lack by the body.\nWHAT’S A FOOTBALL PLAYER TO DO?\nWe absolutely need water, but\xa0should be warned not to overdo it.\nIn the modern era, where fluid is widely available, in order to stay adequately hydrated, the following must occur: First, a variety of fluids needs to be freely available, and secondly, athletes should be given the freedom to drink whenever they feel thirsty.\nAnd when they\xa0get hot, they need the opportunity to pour generous amounts of ice water over their heads instead of into their mouths to promote evaporative cooling, rather than dilute sodium levels. Better yet, they should be allowed to go inside and cool off.\nWe should recognise who the “true champions” may be with regards to most modern day hydration advice.\nAccording to the latest figures, bottled water sales have increased to US$18.5 billion dollars, up 8.8 per cent from the previous year. This revenue does not include the vast array of purified, infused, oxygenised, sparkled, distilled, intravenous and reverse osmosis versions that compete for attention on the market.\nWhile we all need water, drinking until our “urine is clear” is money (and water) flushed away. And with the threat of overdrinking high in motivated athletes, I ask coaches and trainers to reconsider before enforcing the urine colour chart in athlete locker rooms: Is it worth the risk?\nDr\xa0Tamara Hew-Butler is a podiatric physician and associate professor of Exercise and Sport Studies at Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan.

That third quarter was unbelievable. It was a true testament of everyone on the team.""\nIt was another huge performance from Curry, who has stepped into the void created by Kevin Durant\'s injury absence to deliver back-to-back 30-point games in the opening two games of the series.\nCurry finished with 37 points from 11 of 22 shooting, adding eight rebounds, eight assists and six turnovers.\n\'WE STOLE THAT GAME\'\nKlay Thompson added 24 points while Green finished with 16 points. Looney (14 points) and Jordan Bell (11) also cracked double digits.\nWarriors coach Steve Kerr admitted that his team, who are chasing a third straight NBA championship this season and a fourth in five seasons, had been fortunate to escape with the win.\n""We stole that game,"" a relieved Kerr said. ""I thought they outplayed us for much of the night, the majority of the night. But we\'ve been here before.\n""I think our experience helped us. We\'ve done this a few times before. But we stole it tonight for sure. They outplayed us.""\nKerr said the Warriors had been expecting a backlash from Portland following their win in game one on Tuesday.\n""They\'ve had two days to stew on the first game and make their adjustments. So we knew it was coming,"" Kerr said. ""We didn\'t find our edge until the third quarter. But the NBA game is a long, long game.\n""And with our team we always feel like we have a chance. And we kept playing tonight and we got it done.""\nLillard led the scoring for Portland with 23 points while C.J.

""We played a good game, we led for a good part of the game. We had a chance to win and we didn\'t.\n""You hate to lose a game but we showed that we can compete with them.

      Is your high intensity exercise regime causing you to get injured?
  </h1>, 'text': 'You know the drill. These days, getting fit is often about activating #beastmode and making sure that you #traindirty. While moving and exercising is always a good thing, these catchphrases imply that you’re not getting a workout if you don’t push yourself to your limit and beyond.\nCase in point: Trendy high octane fitness classes like F45, bootcamps and spin or indoor cycling.\n\n\n“Group workouts bring a club or team environment into training, which have a positive effect on the training environment, performance and motivation to continue to exercise,” said Dr Cormac O Muircheartaigh, medical director of The Sports Medicine Lab. “But, it is more difficult to monitor and adapt the individual’s training load and volume.”\nThe trouble starts when there is “no long-term planning on recovery and adaptation which is critical to allow the body to tolerate the ongoing training load”, he added.\nThat’s when issues like rotator cuff injuries, knee or hip pains happen.\nAccidents such as fractured toes from heavy equipment falling on the feet to shoulder injuries caused by lifting weights without proper warm-ups are also becoming more common. There is also a rare but very severe condition called rhabdomyolysis when muscles break down due to sudden over-exercise (more on that later).\nSophie Penco, a physiotherapist at Focus Pilates says, “What we have seen in recent years is the increase in workouts that can be done in a shorter period of time as people are becoming more time poor. Many of these HIIT (high intensity interval training) style workouts include high impact and plyometric exercises – with minimal warm up or cool down – that can increase the risk of injury if they are not gradually and progressively started and increased.”\nBut don’t let the possibility of getting an injury deter you from going to the gym as the benefits of regular exercise far outweighs these risks.\n\n\n“Good movement and exercise are important to for health and ageing well. In any exercise programme or sport activity, there is a risk of injury,” pointed out Dr Kevin Tomassini, a chiropractic doctor from Spine and Performance at Core Collective.\nIn fact, most injuries are preventable if fitness junkies follow some simple guidelines.\nHe adds, “Perform exercise with the correct form, train in the proper environment and with proper equipment and get help from good fitness, wellness and health professionals.”\nGym bunnies, watch out for these sports injuries and find out the experts’ tips on how to prevent them.\nSTRAINS AND SPRAINS\nWhat is it: A sprain is a stretch or tear in a ligament while a strain is a stretch or tear in a muscle or a tendon.\nCauses: These are common in high intensity exercise programmes. Muscle strains are frequently caused by sudden stopping, jumping, pivoting or throwing movements, while ligament sprains usually happen when a person falls or twists a limb (usually the ankle and knee) such as when jumping or doing pylometric exercises. “Wrist and thumb sprains are also increasing in frequency with some of the most loved exercises such as burpees,” said Penco.\nHow to prevent: Start with lighter weights and cover shorter distances at a slower pace and build up gradually, advises Dr Tomassini. Remember, you do not have to keep pace with the person exercising next to you.\nTreatment: Flexibility-based activities like yoga or barre may weaken the overstretched area further. Instead, work on strengthening exercises to stabilise the injured joint once the injury has healed. Mild strains and sprains may heal within two weeks to a month with proper care:\n\n\nIf the sprain or strain is severe, you should seek medical treatment immediately and a physiotherapist may be involved in rehabilitation.\nSHIN SPLINTS\nWhat is it: Also known as medial tibial stress syndrome, which causes pain in the front of the lower leg.\nCauses: These are often seen with new runners who try to build their mileage too quickly, or even regular runners who change the terrain they run on, said Penco. There is an increasing number of outdoor fitness groups who run on hard surface or do hill sprints – and people who are not accustomed to outdoor training may struggle with this.\nHow to prevent: Maintain good form when running or jumping.\nTreatment: Do not “push through the pain” as that will aggravate your condition. “Treatment involves correcting individual risk factors such as poor foot intrinsic strength, poor running gait and hip stability,” said Dr O Muircheartaigh.\n\n\nSHOULDER INJURIES\nWhat is it: The rotator cuff muscle is a common problem area and injuries include impingement syndrome, bursitis or tendonitis. Symptoms include pain as well as difficulty lifting the arms or stretching the shoulders.\nCauses: A common injury among Crossfit devotees, shoulder injuries are often caused by lifting weights that are too heavy, and not warming up, said Dr Tomassini. Dumbbell shoulder press injuries are common too.\nHow to prevent: Learn the proper weightlifting technique and posture from an expert and use a weight you can control, before increasing the weight progressively.\nThose with tight shoulders can also consider pilates sessions. “Pilates puts a strong focus on thoracic mobility which in turn allows for a safer range of motion for the shoulder. Tight upper spine means that shoulder range of motion, especially in overhead positions predisposes us to shoulder injuries, said Daniel Dittmar, head instructor and exercise physiologist at Focus Pilates.\nTreatment: Seek medical advice to get an accurate diagnosis for the cause of your shoulder pains. The appropriate treatment will follow.\nANTERIOR KNEE AND HIP PAINS\nWhat is it: Sharp pain in the knee or hips\nCauses: The increased load through the kneecap with the downstroke on cycling can aggravate the knee. Runners may experience similar pains too.\nHow to prevent it: Learn to adjust your spin bike so that you have a proper seating position and practice the proper stroke technique and cadence when you cycle, advises Dr O Muircheartaigh. It is important to have sufficient rest in between sessions.\nTreatment: Usually starts with strengthening the quadriceps, hamstrings, hip flexors and gluteal muscles.\nLOWER BACK\nWhat is it: Spinal disc injuries, which can cause sharp pains.\nCauses: Poor form and technique when doing squats and deadlifts, which are increasingly common in many group fitness classes.\nHow to prevent: If you do not know how to lift, consult with a qualified trainer to perfect your form and do not rush into heavy weights before you are ready. Complement your workouts with core strengthening and flexibility exercises.\nTreatment: Before taking the plunge into surgery, consider rehabilitative treatment with a physiotherapist or a chiropractor who could help to improve the alignment and motion of the spine.\n\n\nBROKEN OR FRACTURED TOES\nWhat is it: A small break in the bone of the toes or feet – this can be excruciatingly painful and you may not be able to bear weight on your injured foot.\nCauses: This is increasingly caused by accidental dropping of gym equipment on the feet or falling off boxes during box jumps. It can also happen with overuse, such as with long distance runners.\nHow to prevent: It may be stating the obvious, but avoid throwing weights and other gym equipment on the floor after using them and watch your step when sprinting or jumping.\nTreatment: An orthopaedic specialist can reset the fractured bone fragments back to their original position.\nRHABDOMYLYSIS\nWhat is it: A rare but very serious condition when muscles break down and release their contents into the bloodstream, which can lead to complications such as kidney failure.\nCauses: Acute, unaccustomed high intensity exercise is one of the main causes of this rare condition, says Dr O Muircheartaigh. In other words, exercise newbies who engage in extremely strenuous fitness activity without proper training are most at risk.\nHow to prevent it: Make sure that when you exercise, especially if you are just starting out, that you do not overexert yourself. Start slow and then pick up the intensity with time and progression, advises Dr Tomassini.\nTreatment: If you experience symptoms of this condition, which includes extreme exhaustion after exercising, weak muscles, irregular heartbeat or dark-coloured urine, go to a hospital immediately. Prompt treatment is essential for a full recovery.\n', 'related_topics': ['     exercise ', '     sports ', '     Expert Advice ', '     Fitness ', '     health ']}"

Almost a million tickets have been sold for matches in the nine host cities.\nThis was certainly a fine start with a carnival atmosphere despite the cool evening and the French showing their credentials.\nFrance\'s own football federation have set the team the target of going all the way to the final in Lyon on July 7.\nThe problem for coach Corinne Diacre\'s side is that, if they win their group, they could well end up facing reigning champions the United States in Paris in the quarter-finals.\nGermany, who face China on Saturday, and England are also among the contenders.\nThe USA, whose legal battle to be paid the same as their male counterparts has made waves in the run-up to the tournament, start their campaign against Thailand in Reims on Tuesday.\nRanked fourth in the world, the French women have underperformed at recent major tournaments, losing in the quarter-finals of the last World Cup, Euro 2017 and the last Olympics.\nDiacre is relying on a core of players from Lyon, Europe\'s leading club side who won a fourth successive Champions League last month.\nThere were seven Lyon players in France\'s starting line-up, and two of them combined for the ninth-minute opener, captain Henry with the low ball into the box for Le Sommer to fire in off the crossbar. It was Le Sommer\'s 75th goal for her country.\nSouth Korea offered little, with their star player, Chelsea\'s Ji So-yun, barely touching the ball.\nFrance thought they had a second before the half-hour mark when Renard\'s header down was hooked into the net by Griedge Mbock, but after the celebrations had finally died down, the goal was disallowed for an extremely tight offside following a VAR review.\nThe 1.87-metre (6ft 1ins) Renard was not to be denied, however, as she headed in Gaetane Thiney\'s corner from the right in the 35th minute to make it 2-0.\nShe did it again in first-half stoppage time, this time heading in an Amel Majri corner from the other side.\nKorea can count themselves lucky that this did not turn into a full-blown rout, although the excellent Henry curled in a delightful fourth from 20 yards with five minutes left.\n""I would like to say sorry to football fans in Korea,"" said their coach, Yoon Deok-yeo. ""Today\'s match showed how strong France are.""\n', 'related_topics': ['     sports ', '     football ', '     France ']}"

He was given\xa0Singapore citizenship three years after this.\nKhan, who is a polo manager at the Singapore Polo Club, then managed to gain Singapore citizenship for his son in 2010.\nThe court heard that Khan\'s first lie to\xa0the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA)\xa0was in Jan 24, 2000, when he stated falsely in his application for permanent residence\xa0that he had attended ""Garden East School, Pakistan"" for his secondary-level education.\nHe had not attended this school, nor did he attach any certificate with his application, which was rejected.\nHe tried again in April 2006, going to the ICA\xa0building\xa0and stating that he attended Ibrahim Ali Bhai Secondary School in Pakistan.

His 20 second-half points helped the Bucks rally from a 16-point third-quarter deficit.\nAntetokounmpo became the first player since Oscar Robertson in 1966 to post a 30-plus point triple-double in his opening game of a season.\nBut he said team effort was the key to the comeback win.\n""We stayed together,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""Even though we faced adversity and we weren\'t playing our best basketball in the first quarter and second quarter we came out, we were focused. We were able to move the ball and execute.\n""My team without me did a great job,"" added Antetokounmpo, whose departure with his sixth foul at 5:18 remaining -\xa0and the Bucks up by six - appeared to open the door to the Rockets.\nHouston scored the next five points, Russell Westbrook adding four with a three-pointer and a free throw to trim the deficit to 101-100.\nBut the Rockets, who brought in 2017 MVP Westbrook in the offseason to play alongside their 2018 MVP James Harden, couldn\'t get ahead.\nHouston had dominated early, taking a quick 12-2 lead and going into halftime with a 66-50 advantage.\nWestbrook finished with 24 points, 16 rebounds and seven assists.\nHarden\'s 19 points owed more to his perfect 14-of-14 finish at the free-throw line than his two-of 13 shooting. He added seven rebounds and 14 assists.\nWhile the Bucks looked a team perfectly capable of repeating their 60-win campaign of last season, the long-dominant Golden State Warriors got a taste of what could be a tough road ahead as they fell 141-122 to the ascendant Los Angeles Clippers.\nIn the first game in their glitzy new $1.4 billion Chase Arena in San Francisco the Warriors - now without departed free agent Kevin Durant and injured Klay Thompson - were no match for a Clippers team bolstered this off-season by the arrival of Kawhi Leonard - who was on the Toronto Raptors team that beat the Warriors in the NBA Finals in June.\nLeonard followed up his 30-point performance in a season-opening win over the Los Angeles Lakers with 21 points, but it was Lou Williams who led the Clippers in scoring with 22 off the bench.\n""We\'re not surprised,"" Williams, 32, said of the new-look Clippers\' strong start.

      Commentary: When is it alright for football fans to jeer at their players?
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: David Beckham is one of the most successful and wildly popular players ever to have stepped on to a football field.\nBut the former Real Madrid and Manchester United star has also had the more dubious honour of being booed by his own fans many times over the course of his illustrious career.\nIn 2009, he appeared in New York and was jeered both by the home section and his own LA Galaxy supporters.\nHis crime? Leaving the California club for half a season to go and play on loan with Italian giants AC Milan.\n“There were a lot of people highlighting that I might get booed in the build-up, so I expected it,” he said. “It\'s sometimes nice to get them, actually. It gives you some inspiration. When we played like we did, the boos start to go away in time.""\nNOT ALL HAVE BECKHAM’S THICK SKIN\nNot everyone has Beckham’s thick skin, honed by playing for some of the biggest clubs in the world where demands are high and having shouldered a huge responsibility as captain of England’s football team, which operates under the constant glare of the country’s ruthless tabloid press.\nIn the end, the Englishman won over the doubters in California where his statue stands outside Galaxy’s home stadium.\nAt the moment, it is hard to see the same happening in North London.\nOn Sunday (Oct 27), the issue of whether it is ever acceptable for fans to boo one of their players was again discussed around the world shortly after Arsenal captain Granit Xhaka wandered off the pitch.\nThe 27-year-old had been substituted during a frustrating game in what is threatening to become another disheartening season for one of England’s top clubs, which has not won the English Premier League title since 2004.\nThe North London team was initially leading 2-0 at home to Crystal Palace in a game that saw the Eagles come back with a 2-2 just before Xhaka was taken out with 30 minutes remaining.\nArsenal was desperate for a goal. Fans roared at the decision to replace the captain and, with time of the essence, did not hesitate in expressing their displeasure as the Swiss midfielder ambled from the pitch.\xa0\xa0\nXhaka, made skipper in the summer, reacted, cupping a hand to an ear. Then he appeared to shout “f*** off” before storming down the tunnel, leaving spectators shocked.\nThere are a handful who express some understanding over Xhaka’s poor reaction but the overwhelming consensus is that he was out of line. He has come under heavy criticism by a number of high-profile television pundits.\nFans too have been called out for swearing and cursing at their team during the game.\nLoyalty is a highly prized value. It is an unspoken but commonly understood law of football that you don’t boo your own players.\nFor one, such behavior is usually counter-productive even if there are examples of players bouncing back.\n‘FANS REALISE THEY CAN GO TOO FAR’\nBeckham is one example but there is also Emmanuel Eboue, who was jeered by a section of Arsenal fans for his poor performance in a game at Wigan Athletic in 2008. The Ivory Coast international left the field in tears.\n“‘When you are a footballer and your own fans boo you, it’s very bad ...\xa0your confidence goes,” he said. “After that happened I said to Arsene Wenger, I don’t want to come in anymore for training because I feel bad”.\nYet the Ivory Coast midfielder bounced back to have a solid career at Arsenal, playing over 200 times before leaving in the summer of 2011 to join Turkish giants Galatasaray for a fee of around US$4.5 million, which gave Arsenal a cool profit of about US$1.5 million on a player who had spent over seven years at the club.\n\xa0""I think it (the booing) worked for (Eboue) because people think \'Come on, we have gone too far’""\xa0Arsene Wenger, coach at the time, said. ""I also believe the fans realise that they can go too far and, in that case, part of the public said: \'No that is not right no matter what happens. We have to stand behind the players.\'”\nWenger, who was the subject of “Wenger Out” chants in the final years of his two-decades spell in charge of Arsenal, understood that fans can get upset after being incredibly invested in the team.\n""During the game, it is an emotional response. After, when people take a distance, they think ‘Oh no, we have gone too far’ and they correct it. But I understand when you want so much to win during the game you can go a little bit too far.""\nA NEW BREED OF FOOTBALL FANS\nThere were others who defended Arsenal fans,\xa0claiming that Eboué had committed the cardinal sin of not trying his best. Lack of effort will always anger fans more than lack of talent.\nBut public opinion was split. The Guardian had none of that and called the booing “disgraceful”.\nIt called the reaction a reflection of\xa0not the longstanding English fans who had stayed with their teams during during the sport\'s dark days\xa0of the 1980s, but a new breed of a more demanding kind of spectator who had been attracted to the English game in the 1990s when crumbling stadiums started to be replaced\xa0by shiny new arenas and world-famous stars.\nAs ticket prices have increased, so have expectations. Fans jeering their own team has become increasingly common in recent years.\n“As long as they are in our colours they remain our players,” wrote Richard Williams of the Eboué episode.\n“The behaviour of the Arsenal fans, however, appeared to be driven by something more than old-fashioned frustration. It was the self-expression of a new breed of football fans, with their £1,000 (US$1,280) season ticket and increasing sense of entitlement.”\nMore recently, the Telegraph wrote in 2015 that the modern fan feels a sense of distance from today’s football player and their massive pay packets.\nBooing, the publication wrote, had gone from being the last resort of a disgruntled, die-hard supporter to being an integral part of the matchday experience and expression of dissatisfaction of a paying customer when club performance don’t stand up to expectations.\nYet such attitudes mean there is always a way back.\nXhaka may have a few tough weeks ahead but if he can perform on the pitch, then fans will forgive.\nThere may not be any statues of the Swiss star in North London in years to come but that does not mean his Arsenal career is over.\nJohn Duerden has lived in Asia for 20 years and covers the region’s sporting scene.

  </h1>, 'text': 'LOS ANGELES:\xa0Anthony Davis delivered a 40-point haul as the Los Angeles Lakers cruised to a blowout defeat of the the Memphis Grizzlies on Tuesday (Oct 29).\nDavis lit up the Staples Center with a virtuoso performance, hauling down a mammoth 20 rebounds and providing two assists as the Lakers romped to a 120-91 victory.\nHis display relegated LeBron James to a supporting role, although the veteran superstar still chipped in with 23 points and eight assists.\nTuesday\'s game was a welcome distraction for James, who had been forced to evacuate his Brentwood mansion early on Monday as wildfires tore through nearby hills and canyons in Los Angeles.\nDavis, meanwhile, was happy to take centre-stage with a display that made him the first Laker to record 40 points and 20 rebounds in a game since franchise legend Shaquille O\'Neal.\n""Just wanted to play hard, wanted to go out there and help my team win, and whatever I needed to do, that\'s what I tried to do,"" Davis said.\nThe two teams were level at 47-47 at half-time, but Davis seized control in the third quarter as the Lakers outscored the Grizzlies by 39-20 in the decisive passage of the contest.\n""I knew we were a little bit flat early on and we needed someone to take over and give us a bit of energy and that\'s what I tried to do,"" Davis said.\nDavis\'s points tally included a remarkable 26 of 27 free throw attempts, prompting Lakers fans into early season chants of ""MVP, MVP.""\nBUTLER WOWS ON MIAMI BOW\nIn Miami, Jimmy Butler dropped 21 points on his debut as the Heat pulled away from the Atlanta Hawks 112-97 to improve to 3-1 for the season.\nButler had missed the first three games of the campaign due to the birth of his daughter but showed no signs of rustiness in a solid first outing.\nButler was quickly into his rhythm, nailing his first four shots and scoring 12 points in the first quarter to set Miami on the road to victory.\nButler\'s performance left Heat coach Erik Spoelstra purring with delight.\n""He was running around at shootaround like it was a playoff game,""Spoelstra said. ""He was just so excited to have an opportunity to finally get started in the regular season.""\nMiami though were anything but a one-man band, with Tyler Herro leading the scoring with 29 points and Goran Dragic adding 21 points, both from the bench.\nHerro\'s points tally was the largest by a Miami rookie since Dwyane Wade scored 31 in his maiden season in 2004.\n""That\'s a cool accomplishment, but you\'ve got to keep working,"" Herro said.\nKendrick Nunn and Bam Adebayo both had 17 points on a night when five Miami players made double figures.\nAdebayo had another big defensive showing, pulling down 10 rebounds, making three blocks and two steals on the night.\nIn Denver, the Dallas Mavericks relied on all-round offensive effort to give them a 109-106 win over the Nuggets.\nMaxi Kleber and Tim Hardaway Jr\xa0top-scored with 14 points apiece as nine players cracked double digits.\n', 'related_topics': ['     sports ', '     Miami ']}"

Overall, I am really heartened by the team’s performance as their progress over the season has been really satisfying to see.”\nMeanwhile in the third placing match, Geylang International faced Brunei DPMM in an intense game that ended 2-2 at full-time. But a dramatic penalty shootout saw Geylang trump DPMM with a final score of 12-11, earning Geylang the third spot.\nFor winning the Singapore Cup, Tampines took home the prize money of S$70,000, while Warriors got S$45,000. Geylang and DPMM received S$25,000 and S$10,000 respectively.\nDPMM’s Varankou finished as the tournament’s joint-top scorer alongside Warriors pair Sahil Suhaimi and Khairul Nizam, having each scored four goals.\nSaturday’s match marks the end of the domestic football season, which saw DPMM win the AIA Singapore Premier League (SPL) in September. The 2020 SPL season will begin in February.\nTampines' win also means that Hougang United will earn a spot in the 2020 Asian Football Confederation (AFC) Cup, as Tampines already sealed their berth after finishing second in the SPL.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     sports ', '     Tampines ', '     football ']}"

      Commentary: E-sports is the future of all sports
  </h1>, 'text': 'MANCHESTER: The future of all sports is e-sports.\xa0\nThat may sound like a bold statement but there is growing evidence to support it.\xa0\nToday’s spectators and participants expect to be digitally engaged while they watch. And the most effective way to deliver digital engagement is through “gamification” – the transformation of watching into playing.\nWhile the “real” sports world is still far bigger than the competitive e-sports community, e-sports is showing supporters a new kind of future where fans’ desires for interactivity are fulfilled.\xa0\nConsumers no longer just want to watch or listen, they also want to participate – and e-sports integrates these principles into people’s leisure time.\nVR GAMING\nThe latest transformation that is bringing these two worlds even closer together is virtual reality (VR) gaming that turns e-sports into physically active experiences.\xa0\nVR may just be the technology that unites the two worlds of sports and e-sports which are, otherwise, struggling to find common ground.\nWhile it may take some years to fully realise the impact of e-sports, the rise of both mobile and VR gaming creates tantalising possibilities for the future.\nConsider HADO, a new, two versus two, sports arena-based game consisting of VR battles. Players each wear VR headsets and strap mobile devices to their arms, through which they can see each other’s actions and fling virtual fireballs at each other – sort of a digital version of dodgeball.\nOne of the reasons that HADO is so important is that it brings a three-dimensional experience to an e-sports arena, where otherwise they are played out on flat screens for spectators to watch. Sony is even working on a spectator VR system to watch e-sports in virtual reality.\nThe rise of affordable VR headsets are also kick-starting a new fitness revolution, with pimped-up gyms fast becoming virtual reality exercise spaces. This convergence of high-end gaming technology with physical fitness is a compelling instance of VR’s myriad applications.\nTHE VR OLYMPICS?\nRumours are that the International Olympic Committee is interested in VR as a possible route for e-sports inclusion within the Olympic programme. But rather than just being virtual versions of today’s sports, new kinds of sports such as HADO are likely to emerge.\nAlternatively, the stadiums and fields of conventional sports may be reimagined in virtual arenas, designed to maximise excitement.\xa0\nFor example, tomorrow’s tennis stars could be playing on VR courts where they are able to move in three dimensions, rather than two.\xa0\nThis could be made possible with three-dimensional, full-body VR systems where athletes can feel and truly experience the simulated world around them via exo-suits.\nIn less than one year, the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games will take place, amid widespread speculation that e-sports will find a place on – or at least near – the podium.\xa0\nFor example, an e-sports hotel in Tokyo has been launched and is expected to be ready for the Games. Additionally, Olympic partner Intel recently announced an Olympic-sanctioned e-sports tournament taking place days before the Games open.\nAnd while e-sports will not be a medal sport in Tokyo next year, 2019 is the first year in which a major sports event included e-sports medals.\xa0\nIn this respect, the Southeast Asian Games to be held late this year\xa0is pioneering the association with e-sports and further indicating that this emerging technology is gradually finding its way into sports mega-events.\nTHE FUTURE OF E-SPORTS\nMeanwhile, talks continue to take place in relation to the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, which is likely to follow its two predecessors and have some kind of e-sports event. And in 2019, the European Games included e-sports within its cultural programme, rather than the sports programme.\nIt is worth remembering that, in the early decades of the modern Olympic Games, medals were given for cultural achievements.\xa0\nThe original vision was to celebrate sports blended with culture and education, values still enshrined in the Olympic Charter.\nSo, before we conclude the conversation about the relationship between e-sports and traditional sports, we should remember that today’s burgeoning e-sports can be compared to the beginning of the silent film era 100 years ago. There’s a great deal of technological evolution to come and e-sports are still in the process of being established.\nAndy Miah is Chair of Science Communication & Future Media, in the School of Environment & Life Sciences, University of Salford, Manchester.

      More people with disabilities participating in sport, but more progress can be made: Sim Ann
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: More people\xa0with disabilities (PWD) are participating in sport, with the Government\xa0exploring how a related master plan can make more progress, Senior Minister of State for Culture, Community and Youth Sim Ann told Parliament on Tuesday (Nov 5).\nAccording to Sport Singapore’s (Sport SG) annual National Sports Participation Survey, slightly more than half – or 51 per cent – of PWDs participated in sport in 2018, an increase from the 28 per cent in 2015.\n“We are encouraged by the growth in sports participation amongst persons with disabilities,” Ms Sim said.\nShe was responding to a question by Nominated Member of Parliament and para-athlete Yip Pin Xiu, who asked for a progress update on the Disability Sports Master Plan (DSMP)\xa0launched in May 2016.\nThe DSMP aims to develop Singapore’s capabilities in para sports and raise the profile of Team Singapore para-athletes.\nMs Sim said SportSG has been working with stakeholders since 2016 to implement the DSMP, setting up four Centres of Expertise, opening\xa0seven inclusive gyms and introducing\xa0a range of disability sport programmes.\nOne example is the Inclusive Sports Festival (ISF), which she said has been organised for three successive years and is a “key platform” for PWDs to try sports and an opportunity for the public to learn about disability sport.\n“Altogether, the ISF and other awareness and outreach events have engaged more than 11,000 participants with disabilities and close to 90,000 others in the last three years,” she added.\nBeyond\xa0participation, Ms Sim said SportSG works with key stakeholders, such as the Ministry of Education and Singapore Disability Sports Council (SDSC), to develop talent in disability sports.\nFor instance, she said SportSG provides SDSC with financial resources and facilities to support the training of athletes in various para sports, adding that 10 out of the current crop of 72 spexScholars are para-athletes.\n“Team Singapore para-athletes received campaign funding in their preparations for the upcoming ASEAN Para Games in January next year,” she added.\nMs Sim said SportSG also partnered the International Paralympic Committee to grow the pool of disability sports coaches in Singapore, highlighting that 500 coaches, 300 SportSG staff and 1,600 volunteers have completed relevant courses to support disability sport programmes.\nWhile Ms Sim said the DSMP has made good progress, she said the ministry is continually exploring how to increase its impact, adding that SportSG in August published a progress review in its Vision 2030 mid-term report.\n“SportSG stated in its report that it will broaden its range of partnerships to include corporations and organisations to form ‘Communities of Care’ that can serve the community in impactful ways, such as by supporting the DSMP and promoting social inclusion through sport,” she stated.\n“We welcome ideas and suggestions from the Member and others in the sport and special needs communities to improve the implementation of the DSMP.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     sports ']}"

      Dreams dashed for Terengganu's aspiring female gymnasts as state bars them from competitions over attire concerns
  </h1>, 'text': 'TERENGGANU: Eight-year-old Lara Khadijah Cornelius McAfee loves learning gymnastics because she can perform acrobatic movements.\n“It’s fun because I get to do stuff my friends can’t, like handstands,” she said with a cheeky smile.\nThe Terengganu resident has no trouble steadying herself with both hands on the mat, as\xa0she pranced through the moves of her routine.\xa0\nThe small-framed girl told her coach at at Aliashka Fun Gym that she wants to follow in the footsteps of Farah Ann Abdul Hadi, Malaysian gymnastic queen who recently qualified for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.\nBut what she might not fully understand yet is that the state government of\xa0her home state\xa0Terengganu has put\xa0in place sporting guidelines that will make it near impossible for her to train and compete professionally in the near future.\xa0\nThe guidelines include withdrawing women from competing in all forms of gymnastics\xa0as athletes would “display indecent movements” that would expose their bodies.\nThe Terengganu state government, led by Islamic political party Parti Islam Se-Malaysia (PAS), is also drafting a syariah-compliant code of conduct for its athletes.\xa0\xa0\nMs Nurul Alia Jamal, Lara\'s coach and a former national gymnast, said\xa0she disagreed with the state government’s decision and called for more discussion with the local gymnastics fraternity.\n“Lara wants to be like Farah Ann, but with\xa0the new guidelines, her dreams will be dashed and all our hard work will be wasted,” she said.\n“There should be a special discussion to resolve the issue, even if that means finding a set of clothing that is suitable. Barring them from training and competing is not the answer,” she added.\nHALT RECRUITMENT OF FEMALE GYMNASTS, FOCUS ON ALL-MALE TEAM\xa0\nThe Terengganu Gymnastics Association, which talent-spots and trains athletes from schools in the state, told CNA that they will be scaling back on recruiting promising female athletes in the near future, as per the guidelines from the state government.\nTerengganu sent its largest female gymnastics contingent in 2018 to the biannual national sporting event Sukma Games, but they will not\xa0be sending any female gymnasts for the next edition in July 2020.\n“Our hands are tied, we have to follow the guidelines from the state government,” said the association’s secretary-general and head coach Ahmad Akramin.\n“It\'s better if we just focus on males for our upcoming trials. We will have higher medal chances if we streamline our resources in that manner,” added the former national gymnast vaulter, who once clinched bronze at\xa0the Southeast Asian Games.\nMr Ahmad oversees the training for the state athletes and has a handful of female gymnasts under his charge.\nWhen CNA visited a training session at the state\'s Bukit Nenas sports school, there were a handful of female athletes.\xa0\nThe teenagers were on a punishing routine - swinging on uneven bars with their\xa0chalked hands and doing handstands across the gymnasium repeatedly. But their hard work could\xa0be\xa0in vain as they would not be given the opportunity to represent Terengganu in the national meet in 2020.\xa0\nMr Ahmad said that the female gymnasts will continue training for the moment, but if they want\xa0to go far in the sport, they might have to\xa0train with the national team in Bukit Jalil in Kuala Lumpur\xa0or reside in another state.\n“We’ve had a non-Muslim female gymnast who is talented, but she has moved to train with the national team in Kuala Lumpur. It’s possible for aspiring girl gymnasts to fulfill their dreams, but very challenging,” said Mr Ahmad.\nWE ARE NOT THE TALIBAN: EXCO MEMBER\nThe state government unveiled its sporting guidelines in August 2018, three months after PAS\xa0wrested control of Terengganu from the Barisan Nasional coalition after Malaysia’s\xa014th general election.\nThe implementation of the guidelines have been done in stages so as not to ""appear radical"", Terengganu’s Youth, Sports and NGO Development executive councillor Wan Sukairi Wan Abdullah told CNA.\n“We know that we are managing people, not robots. People have feelings, they can be rebellious, they can be accepting … we don’t want people to see Terengganu as an extreme state like the Taliban,” he said.\nMr Wan Sukairi explained that the written guidelines are based on Islam and syariah compliance. He explained that the rules\xa0address points like attire, coaching, physio treatment and other areas of sports related to training and competition.\nHe also outlined that the importance of “modest attire” for sports is to take care of the welfare of the athletes and prevent sexual misconduct from happening.\n“You may have heard of reports of molest and rape involving the coaches. These things happen and we want to prevent all these things from happening by introducing these\xa0(sporting) guidelines that cover\xa0early preparation to competition,” he said.\nTERENGGANU TO PRESS ON IN SPITE OF CRITICISM\xa0\nTerengganu’s efforts has drawn flak from the country’s sporting fraternity.\nThe National Sports Council (NSC) director-general Ahmad Shapawi Ismail was quoted as saying that the Terengganu state government’s concerns over female gymnasts will affect the future of potential female athletes who can make the country proud.\nMalaysia’s Youth and Sports Minister Syed Saddiq Syed Abdul Rahman said\xa0athletes are the country\'s ""heroes and heroines, regardless of what they wear"".\xa0\nHe also told local media that Mr Wan Sukairi had given him his commitment that he would ""advise"" and not\xa0""coerce or force"" the female athletes.\xa0\xa0\xa0\nIn the face of such criticism, Mr Wan Sukairi insisted that he will spearhead the implementation of the guidelines and prove that athletes can be competitive with syariah-compliant attire.\xa0\n“We respect (the federal government) and acknowledge that there are many things that we have to follow and adhere to and discuss. But with regards to this issue, we have a say,” he said.\n“I would rather we commit to proving, not just to the minister and the federal government, but to everyone that even by wearing syariah-compliant attire, our athletes are not just capable of competing, but become champions,” Mr Wan Sukairi added.\nHe cited the example of Terengganu’s sprint queen Azreen Nabila Alias, who clinched three golds in the 2018 Sukma Games\xa0while wearing hijab and long tights.\nThe 19-year-old also smashed the Games record in the 100m dash en route to winning the Best Sportsgirl Award.\n“It’s about how fast you run, not what you wear,” said Mr Wan Sukairi.\n“If you run slow, you won’t win even by wearing shorts, but if you run fast, you can win while wearing a sarong,” he added.\nHis sentiments are shared by many Terengganu locals, including a mother who sends her daughter for gymnastic classes at\xa0Aliashka Fun Gym.\nThe mother, who declined to be named, told CNA that she is fine with her daughter doing gymnastics at a young age, but not as a profession or for competition.\n“It\'s\xa0good to ensure they are fit and active. But the attire is not modest, so I would not be comfortable with\xa0her performing like this in front of crowds,” she said.\nMeanwhile, Ms Nurul Alia, the gym’s head coach,\xa0is hopeful that the federal government would find sports apparel\xa0with suitable fabric and hemline that will allow women in Terengganu to compete again.\n“I just hope they will find a compromise so that girls can continue the sport. If they find a set of clothing that is suitable,\xa0is compliant to international gymnastic laws and is comfortable, I think that’s not a problem,” she said.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Malaysia ', '     sports ']}"

      Commentary: Invincible Liverpool look set to regain past glory
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: If you had told fans in England back in 1990 when Liverpool were celebrating an 18th league title that the club would go at least 30 years before lifting the trophy again, nobody would have believed it.\xa0\nThe Reds had dominated English football all the way through the 1970s and 1980s, winning 11 domestic leagues and four European titles. They were a relentless machine.\nSuch days look like they may be about to return. Liverpool are champions of Europe but the prize the Reds really want is the English Premier League title. Many think that after a wait of three decades this is their year,\xa0even though it is only November and there is still two-thirds of the season still to play.\nThat is how impressive Liverpool are. It is not just the eight-point lead at the top of the table -\xa0teams have squandered similar leads in the past.\xa0\nIt is not just the fact that they are evolving year after year. It is the belief that stands out. The confidence is almost visible especially at home at Anfield where Liverpool have not lost a league game since April 2017, an amazing run of 46 games.\nIt was Fortress Anfield again on Sunday (Nov 10)\xa0when Liverpool passed the biggest test of their season so far with flying colours. Champions Manchester City arrived and then were two goals down within 13 minutes thanks to some breathtaking attacking play from Liverpool. It ended 3-1.\nLast season, the two teams were neck and neck in the title race. Liverpool lost just one game out of the 38 - to Manchester City - as they collected a staggering 97 points. That would have given the team the title in 25 out of the previous 27 Premier League seasons but not this time. Manchester City managed a point more.\nSo to defeat City, a club that has spent over US$1 billion on players since being taken over by the Abu Dhabi Group in 2008 and has Pep Guardiola - the Spaniard is regarded by many as the best coach in the world - in charge of the team was always going to be a big result.\xa0\nAnd so it is. Liverpool fans are a rare breed in that they would not swap their leader for Guardiola. Juergen Klopp arrived in the port city in October 2015 and has completely revolutionised the club. Of the first team regulars when Klopp first arrived, only captain Jordan Henderson remains.\nThe genial German has assembled a team full of exciting attacking talents. The three-man attack is perhaps the most potent and exciting in the world.\xa0\nMohamad Salah of Egypt, Senegalese striker Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino of Brazil are fast, mobile and almost impossible to defend against when they are at the top of their game - as they usually are these days.\nThe midfield has taken time to build but Henderson has developed from an energetic player to an authoritative leader. In May 2018, Klopp signed Fabinho and in the 31 league games the Brazilian has started, he has yet to taste defeat.\xa0\nHis spectacular strike after six minutes put Liverpool ahead against Manchester City but it is not his goals that have helped the Reds move to the next level but his intelligence, elegance and ability to read the game.\nFabinho has a new nickname as ""The Lighthouse""\xa0after Liverpool’s assistant manager, Pepijn Lijnders said he is “like a lighthouse inside the organised chaos that we want”.\nKlopp has also built a fine defence, waiting patiently until he could sign Virgil Van Dijk in January 2018. The Dutch centre-back may have cost £75 million (US$83 million), a world record for a defender then, but has been worth every penny and in September this year was the runner-up in the FIFA’s Player of the Year award.\nAfter Liverpool lost the 2018 UEFA Champions League final to Real Madrid with goalkeeper Loris Karius making two grave mistakes, Klopp showed that he could be as ruthless as his attack and quickly signed Brazilian shot-stopper Allison.\nMuch cheaper were the two full-backs, probably the best pairing in the world, with local lad Trent Alexander-Arnold on the right and Scotsman Andy Robertson on the left.\xa0\nIt all adds to a formidable unit especially with a respected tactician, motivator and man-manager as coach.\xa0\nGary Neville was commentating on television during the win over Manchester City. The former Manchester United defender summed up where Liverpool are right now.\n“They love the manager these fans, they love the team, they believe in the team,” Neville said. “They have won the Champions League and they’ll never have a better chance to win the Premier League.”\nHowever, Neville knows that, as impressive as Liverpool have been, there is still a long way to go. He was part of the Manchester United team that were 12 points behind Newcastle United in January 1996 but still went on to win the title.\nAs their games this season have proven, Liverpool are made of sterner stuff. But while their starting 11 are recognised as the best in the league, Manchester City have greater strength in depth.\xa0\nThe Reds have been relatively fortunate with injuries so far but that can change especially as the team is competing on numerous fronts at home, in the UEFA Champions League and also in December’s Club World Cup in Qatar.\nBut what their squad depth lacks, their manager makes up for as Steve Kerr, the coach of NBA team Golden State Warriors and a Klopp fan, points out.\xa0\n""What I like is that he also seems to enjoy it,"" Kerr told NBCSN. ""It\'s not just that he\'s a madman. He\'s laughing, and smiling and fist-pumping, and I love the concept of joy in sports. It\'s one of the most important values to me and the Warriors. It\'s a powerful emotion, a powerful factor for a great team of any sport. Joy, enjoying what you\'re doing and the joy of just feeling young and free, and playing.""\nWhen Liverpool are playing like they are and winning like they are then it is not a surprise that Klopp and the millions of fans around the world are enjoying this ride.\xa0\nWhether they are happy next May when the season ends remains to be seen but at the moment there are few who would bet against it.\nJohn Duerden has lived in Asia for 20 years and covers the region’s sporting scene.

      Commentary: Why Japan shifted the Olympic marathon from Tokyo to Sapporo
  </h1>, 'text': 'The International Olympic Committee decided to shift next year’s Olympic marathon from Tokyo to Sapporo to protect athletes from the heat.\nTokyo’s average temperatures during the month of August exceed 30 degrees Celsius, with some days reaching 35 degrees Celsius. Sapporo, about 800km to the north of Tokyo, is expected to be 5 to 6 degrees Celsius cooler than Tokyo at this time.\nSome of Tokyo’s officials have argued for a night-time race in Japan’s capital instead, but without success.\nWhile the move has stirred debate, shifting the events to a cooler climate will reduce the athletes’ risk of health complications that can result from endurance exercise in extreme heat.\nENDURANCE AND EXTREME HEAT\nIn September, several athletes collapsed while competing in the marathon at the World Athletics Championships in Doha, Qatar.\nDespite running the marathon at midnight, the extreme temperatures – about 32 degrees Celsius – meant 28 out of 68 women did not complete the race. Similar effects were seen in the men’s event.\nSustained exertion in extreme heat can lead to heat exhaustion and heat stroke. When our body is under heat stress, it moves blood to the skin to cool us down.\nWith prolonged exposure, this can mean a lack of blood reaching the exercising muscles, brain and other organs.\nBODY TEMPERATURE AND TIME OF DAY\nThe body clock is responsible for regulating the cycle of our body temperature throughout the day. Of course, our body temperature is influenced by the conditions we are in – but our body clock sets somewhat of a “baseline”. This “baseline” is generally highest in the afternoon.\nAn increase in body temperature speeds up metabolism and makes our muscles contract more effectively. So in general, athletes perform better in the afternoon. When body temperature is at its highest they experience peaks in speed, strength, power and flexibility.\nThis is likely why more athletic world records are broken in the afternoon than other times of day.\nHowever, endurance events in the heat present a unique challenge: extremely high body temperatures can jeopardise the athletes’ health and performance.\nThe 2020 Olympic marathon events were scheduled for 6am starts to avoid Tokyo’s highest temperatures. There were also plans to provide shade and coat the roads with heat-shielding material to reduce road surface temperatures.\nIn response to the decision to switch to Sapporo, Tokyo officials proposed\xa0changing the start time to 5am, or even 3am.\nARE “MIDNIGHT MARATHONS” THE ANSWER?\nAt night the body is in “heat loss mode”. Thanks to our body clocks, body temperature starts to drop in the late evening. It typically reaches its lowest point around 5am.\nStarting a long-distance race with a lower body temperature has advantages. Competitors typically reduce their body temperature by immersing themselves in cold water or wearing cooling garments, but these methods only delay rises in body temperature. So combining these strategies with a naturally lower baseline body temperature may help athletes stay cooler for longer.\nDespite this, night marathons still present challenges for athletes. As the body clock starts to reduce body temperature in the late evening to prepare for sleep, this slows down our metabolism and leads to lower energy levels. Many of us know the difficulty of getting up in the middle of the night to watch a sporting event – imagine having to compete at 3am.\nAnd even though ambient temperatures are lower at night than during the day, overnight temperature lows in Tokyo can still be close to 30 degrees Celsius in August.\nAnother major factor, relevant in day time as well as night time conditions, is humidity. The process of sweat evaporating from the skin is what cools the body down. In humid environments, we cannot sweat as effectively because there is so much water in the air – so the body cannot regulate its temperature as well.\nIn Tokyo, summer humidity can be well over 70 per cent. These levels, similar to those seen during the recent marathons in Doha, mean athletes shed heat less effectively. So the combination of high humidity and high temperatures can be particularly dangerous.\nAthletes have to rely on other forms of heat loss, such as radiation (via infrared rays) and convection (movement of air across the skin). But even these can be less effective as air temperature approaches skin temperature.\nAlongside these physiological challenges, running in darkness is associated with greater perceived effort and over-estimation of distance travelled.\nREADY, SET, SAPPORO\nThe race in Sapporo has been scheduled during daylight hours, which aligns better with the body clock.\nSimilar levels of humidity in Sapporo may still pose challenges, but avoiding extreme heat will reduce the danger of athletes overheating and suffering health complications.\nThe downside is the timing of this decision: with the Olympics less than nine months away, athletes and coaches have already been preparing for Tokyo and its conditions.\nChloe Taylor is a senior lecturer in sport and exercise science in the Western Sydney University.

  </h1>, 'text': 'MANILA: He prowled the touchline constantly, gesticulating, shouting, urging.\xa0\nAt times, Laos coach V\xa0Sundramoorthy’s voice seemed to echo into the grandstands and at the final whistle, he had the best reason to shout, as Laos held Singapore to a 0-0 draw at the 30th SEA Games on Monday (Nov 26).\nSundram’s Laos hassled, harried and harassed Fandi Ahmad’s Singapore throughout the 90 minutes at the Rizal Memorial Stadium, and their reward was a hard-earned point.\nAfter a scrappy start to the game, the Young Lions’ first opportunity came courtesy of Faris Ramli, who cut in from the left but directed his shot just over the bar.\nBut urged on by Sundram, Singapore’s former national team head coach, Laos grew into the game, biting into tackles against the much taller Singapore players.\n""We expected Singapore to play the long balls to Ikhsan (Fandi) and to the flank to Faris where he is able to beat somebody one on one,""\xa0said Sundram at a post-game press conference.\xa0\n""We did it in training to make sure that my right-wing doubles (on) him and not give him space and time.\n“And for Ikhsan, we needed to stop the crosses … and we needed to mark him.”\nFandi’s side had a\xa0scare in the 30th minute as the Laotians won a freekick just outside the Singapore box.\xa0But Young Lions custodian Zharfan Rohaizad held well.\nAs the game opened up, a minute later, Ikhsan was played cleverly through by Shah Shahiran, only for Laos goalkeeper Xaysavath to block with his legs.\nAnother chance fell the way of Singapore a couple of minutes later as Faris carved his way into the box and found Irfan, but the centreback could only fire his shot wide.\nSingapore started the second half in lively fashion, with\xa0Zulqarnaen Suzliman picking out Ikhsan Fandi, but the Raufoss striker could only direct his shot straight at the goalkeeper.\nZulqarnaen was the next player to attempt an effort of his own, but his low shot\xa0was palmed away.\nSingapore began to pile on the pressure, with\xa0Shah shooting narrowly wide of the post with the Laos goalkeeper beaten. Then it was Ikhsan with a header just over.\nDespite the Young Lions having the height advantage, Laos held firm.\n“We worked hard on marking (during) set-plays which I think the boys have done very well,” explained Sundram.\nAs the Young Lions pressed, Laos soaked up the pressure and almost delivered a sucker punch - only for defender Syahrul Sazali to deliver an excellent block.\nArguably, the best chance of the game came in the 78th minute, as a floating cross from Tajeli Salamat found Ikhsan, but his header hit the crossbar and went over.\nAs the clock ticked down, tackles began to fly in but the Laotian side held on for the draw.\nSpeaking to the media after the game, Fandi stressed his disappointment at not getting the\xa0three points.\n“It wasn’t our best game but we still created a number of chances which we could have scored,” he said. “I guess it was not our day today.\n“We had our chances but I thought our midfielders weren’t dominating in the first half - especially in the first half -\xa0and in the second half when we came out, I thought we could have gotten some good chances to finish it.”\nThe Young Lions have never won SEA Games gold.\nSingapore last won a medal at the SEA Games in 2013, when it took home\xa0bronze in Myanmar. It failed to progress from the group stages at the last two SEA Games.\xa0\nFielding a question from a Vietnamese reporter about Singapore’s policy of naturalising foreign footballers, Fandi also noted that player development has been an issue for Singapore in recent times.\xa0\n“It’s very difficult for us. Other countries are not the same as Singapore,” Fandi said.\n“The situation changes because we used to develop many players but now it’s very difficult for us. That\'s why maybe 10\xa0years ago, we have many (foreign players)\xa0because we\xa0don\'t\xa0have ... enough\xa0numbers.\n“And majority of our players here are not professional footballers like Vietnam or any other countries in Southeast Asia, majority are students and NSmen … That is the difference between us and that’s why we hope that (in) future\xa0we can try to persuade to get back the foreign talent scheme here because it\'s going to be difficult for us long term.""\nThe football competition is an age-group tournament comprising Under-22 teams, which\xa0can field two overage players.\nSingapore are in Group B, which consists of defending champions Thailand, regional\xa0 heavyweights Indonesia and Vietnam as well as Brunei and Laos.\nIn Group A, hosts Philippines are\xa0drawn with\xa0Malaysia, Myanmar, Cambodia and Timor Leste.\xa0\nThe top two teams from each group qualify for the semi-finals.\nWhen asked after the game if the result was ""extra-special"" given his ties with Singapore, Sundram said: “Not really, because Singapore is my country - so it’s totally different.\n“My advantage is that I know eventually all the players, I’ve been watching them grow up and its a good point for Laos to start the campaign and we are satisfied.\nThe Young Lions will on Thursday\xa0face Indonesia, who upset Thailand 2-0 in the day’s earlier game.\n“They will be a dangerous team,” said Fandi. “We have to wake up and we can’t play like what we did today.”\nFollow Mediacorp’s coverage of the 30th SEA Games and get the widest Team Singapore coverage with four LIVE channels on Toggle.

      Commentary: Let’s hold off judging the Philippines as SEA Games host
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: Even before the Southeast Asian (SEA) Games torch is lit in Manila on Saturday (Nov 30), the host country has come under fire.\n\nCREDIBILITY HIT\nComplaints have included incomplete infrastructure for the Games, with work still being done to the façade of the Rizal Memorial Sports Complex, and international journalists being stationed in a makeshift media centre.\nThe management of athletes has also fallen short as reports showed some resting on the floor because hotels were not ready to check them in yet, while others have complained of insufficient or poor provision of food.\nThe Thai football team reportedly trained in the streets because the training facilities allocated to them were\xa0just too far away from their hotel.\nSuch reports and more\xa0coming out of the Philippines have dealt something of a blow to the country’s reputation and credibility.\nHowever, while athletes and officials have valid reasons for griping, some of the criticism levied at the Philippines is just\xa0unfair and premature.\nA DEVELOPING PROBLEM? \nSome have said that the Philippines’ lack of preparation for these games is due to its ineptitude.\xa0\nOne reader commented: “That's what you get for hosting in a third world country. The Philippines President is doing his best to clean up the country but the ungrateful people kept trying to undo his efforts.”\nBut hosting large international and regional sporting events can be a logistical challenge for any country, even the most savvy and well-practised in organising global events.\nWhen American city Atlanta hosted the 1996 Olympics, poor transportation planning saw athletes and fans delayed for events in extra-long bus rides with drivers from out of town trying to navigate the city’s complex highways.\nScheduling of the Olympics itself came under criticism as the July-August period coincides with Atlanta’s hottest period each year.\nThe first weekend of those Games saw athletes braving temperatures that exceeded 37 degrees Celsius.\nThere was also the tragic incident of a bomb exploding in the Centennial Olympic Park which killed two and wounded more than 100.\nSpain infuriated international footballers through airport and flight delays, ticketing and hotel mess-ups when it hosted the 1982 World Cup.\nLogistics lapses over meals for volunteers and food poisoning were also a part of Singapore’s hosting of the Youth Olympic Games in 2010.\xa0\xa0\nThe Philippines may have had some hiccups in the lead up to the opening ceremony of the SEA Games.\nBut having hosted three successful editions of the regional competition before in 1981, 1991 and 2005, it has a pretty decent track-record of delivering the goods when it matters.\nLET THE GAMES BEGIN \nSecond, it is a little premature to pass a verdict when the SEA Games have not even officially begun. From my experience, host countries eventually find a way to iron out teething issues.\nIn 2014, just months before Brazil hosted the World Cup, international media reports suggested that the South American football-crazy country was ill-prepared.\nCiting the country’s high crime rate and infrastructural lapses, such as incomplete stadiums and a link-bridge collapsing, many said that Brazil would be unable to ensure the safety and security of travelling fans.\nIt so happened I was one of those fans who had planned to watch five matches in Brazil. Despite the trepidation of family and friends, I flew to Brazil.\nWhat I saw first-hand surprised me. Well-organised processes and efficient public transportation ensured that fans getting to the swanky, new stadiums had a seamless, safe and enjoyable experience.\nThe Brazilian government’s US$900 million spending on security for the tournament was evident as armed security forces lined the streets near hotels, stadiums, city-centres and tourist attractions.\nYes, there were initial delays and hiccups in getting the places ready for the tournament.\nBut for all the initial misgivings, the Brazilians eventually delivered a pretty stellar tournament.\nFour years later, the Russians also succumbed to similar criticism in the lead up to its hosting of the 2018 World Cup. Again, concerns of safety, security and preparation were raised.\nAnd again, armed with tickets to four matches, I travelled to Russia.\nIn my two weeks there, I went to\xa0different cities in comfortable and high-speed overnight sleeper trains, which were free-of-charge to all match-ticket holders.\nAlong with the transport, the match infrastructure was impeccable with orderly queues to enter the stadiums and fan-zones.\nEnglish-trained Russian student volunteers were readily available to guide visitors and help us manoeuvre local signs and eateries.\nThe presence of security was prominent throughout the country while Russia’s initiative of issuing electronic fan ID passes to all registered match-ticket holders ensured a safe environment for fans.\nThese experiences tell me that we should perhaps rate the Philippines after the competition is over. And that, like Brazil and Russia, it may be ready by the time the SEA Games officially opens this weekend.\xa0\nA FORGETTABLE INDIAN SUMMER\nAdmittedly, not all host nations get there. For example, when India hosted the 2010 Commonwealth Games, it came under the international spotlight for the wrong reasons.\nThe slow pace of work and bureaucratic hurdles meant that two-thirds of venues were behind schedule a year before the Games were to be hosted, prompting the Commonwealth Games Federation chief Mike Fennell to sound the alarm bells.\n“(T)he current situation poses a serious risk to the Commonwealth Games in 2010,” he reportedly wrote in a letter to the local organising committee.\xa0\xa0\nIndia went on to host the Games but not without hiccups. Participating nations complained about accommodation as the athletes’ village lacked proper safety and reeked of poor hygiene standards, including exposed electrical wiring, plumbing problems, dirty facilities and flooding outside the accommodation.\nSeveral top athletes pulled out of the Games citing risks to their health and safety.\nEmbarrassed by the negative publicity generated by the international media, the Indians scurried to fix the problems but they reacted too slowly and to little avail.\nThe Indian government took a strong stand only after the Games were over. It even ordered a probe on suspected corruption among organising officials.\nPOLITICAL WILL TO SEE IT THROUGH\nThe Philippines, on the other hand, is not waiting until after the Games are over to address the problem of any organising flaws and oversights.\nPresident Rodrigo Duterte has already issued an ultimatum to organisers to work on contingency measures and fix any problems and called for a probe.\nA presidential spokesperson on Tuesday (Nov 26) said that Duterte was “angry over what happened” and has ordered an investigation on “allegations of\xa0incompetence and corruption”.\nIt may well be that this timely intervention by the no-nonsense Duterte could help the Philippines deliver on a successful SEA Games.\nUntil then, let’s reserve judgement and not use derogatory terms like “third-world country” to tar a nation doing its best to welcome regional athletes.\xa0\nMalminderjit Singh is editor at CNA Digital News, Commentary section.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Philippines ', '     SEA Games ', '     sports ', '     Southeast Asia ']}"

The Chinese technology company is behind popular battle royale game PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds Mobile (PUBG) and Call of Duty Mobile.\xa0\nVice president of Tencent Edward Cheng will also serve as vice president of the Federation.\nOn the local front, Mr Chan said that he was “quite happy” that Singapore was able to gather a team of its best e-sports athletes for the SEA Games.\nHe hopes that the Global Esports Games next year will see “a good representation of players” from all participating countries.\nAccording to research firm Newzoo, global e-sports revenue is set to increase nearly 27 per cent to US$1.1 billion this year, surpassing the US$1 billion mark for the first time.\nEstimated e-sports audience will reach 453.8 million people, a year-on-year growth of 15 per cent.\n“At the moment, these games, e-sports, in all these competitions, there’s a lot of money involved,"" said Mr Chan.\n""At the end of it all, some people want to participate for the pride of the flag on the chest, not just money.\n“We hope to eventually turn the narrative around a bit and say yes it’s about money, but it’s also about pride of representing your country at the highest level,” he added.\n', 'related_topics': ['     SEA Games ', '     sports ']}"

  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: I learnt a new word at the recently concluded Southeast Asian (SEA) Games: “chonky”.\n“Chonky” in Doggolingo (another new word I learnt, and it means “dog internet jargon”), is an affectionate word to describe a slightly overweight animal.\nAnd it was used to describe Joseph Schooling cutting a less than flattering image of a swimmer at the New Clark City Aquatic Centre.\xa0\nHaving grown up in the 1980s, I am perhaps a generation removed from those who can now live entire virtual lives in the ether, and completely missed the reference.\nSHOULD WE EVEN BOTHER?\nGrowing up in a pre-internet era where local sports really mattered, when runners, bowlers, footballers, hockey players, swimmers – not just Olympic champions – were backed, celebrated and recognised on the streets, I wonder if modern day Singapore should just give up entirely on sports.\nAfter all, football, which is the one sport that’s most highly watched, has yet to deliver any gold medal in the SEA games’ 60 years history.\nSingapore did come away from the SEA Games with the two best performing athletes – Quah Ting Wen and her brother Zheng Wen – a first Singapore-born men’s singles table-tennis champion in Koen Pang and a 53-gold medal loot that is a very decent record.\nBut there are other accolades that make us proud to stand behind our flag, accolades that come with very literal boosts that we do tend to enjoy.\nAccording to the World Economic Forum, we are the world’s most competitive economy this year.\nWe appreciate the efforts that went into making the Singapore passport – along with Japan’s – the most powerful travel document on the planet.\nWe are the second safest city – just a shade behind Tokyo – and also home to an airport that has been named the world’s best for seven years running.\nPragmatic Singapore embraces these, enjoying their fruits.\nNONE OF IT MAKES SENSE \nSport, in comparison, is a seemingly inconsequential chase that never ends – even when you win, that proverbial boulder rolls back to the bottom of the hill, and the whole process necessitates doing it all over again.\nIn any rational analysis, sport – every sport – is absurd. Take the case of football: 22 people running around a specifically defined patch of grass, believing that the number of times they kick a ball into a net is of profound importance.\nEvery world mark that was considered insurmountable will eventually become commonplace.\nBut world records – like Neil Armstrong setting foot on the moon – take humanity on a journey to a place it has never set eyes on.\nWe are well aware of that feeling, we came out in droves to catch a glimpse of Joe and Singapore’s first Olympic gold medal in 2016, didn’t we?\nWHAT’S GOING ON?\nStepping back to get a broader view of the sporting picture in Singapore, it does seem that the odds in Singapore are stacked – and wildly so – against the hopeful dreamer.\nAnd at every recent failed attempt, the issue of National Service and academic commitments inevitably come to the fore again.\nBut there is some truth to that, and you do feel for the athletes who run in their military boots from the camp to the stadium, only to change into cleated boots and run again; and also for those who train till their muscles burn, then head home to burn the midnight oil with their head buried in books.\nWhile the results of their efforts are celebrated, very few witness athletes pushing their chosen boulders up that hill, a daily – often solitary – grind.\nThere is no need for curfews for this ilk who march to their own almost monastic beat. There is no headspace for internal bickering either.\nBoxer Muhamad Ridhwan has, in the past, risen before dawn to train before the start of fasting in the month of Ramadan, then got his head down to train again at night, after a day of school and work.\nThe likes of our floorball women, SEA Games champions for the last two editions, took it on the chin when they had to partly pay for their trip to the Women’s World Floorball Championship campaign that came merely days after their SEA Games exertions.\nThe women finished 12th – the Republic’s best ever showing since the tournament switched to a one division format in 2011.\nThe floorball women are not alone in this tribe of doers. There are sailors, boxers, rowers, even those gunning for the pinnacle of sport, the Olympics, who scour for funds to fuel their dreams.\nOlympic rowing hopeful Joan Poh, has even gone from Greece to Canada in search of a suitable sporting ecosystem to ensure she can get up to speed. And that approach of working around obstacles is similar to what sons of Singapore football legend Fandi Ahmad took to National Service, enlisting early so they could ply their trade overseas before they were considered too “old.”\nIS THERE HOPE?\nFunding also remains an issue for several sporting hopefuls. While some in the sporting fraternity assert that too much funding is channelled to undeserving sports – they usually finger football – others, even sailors and rowers who chase Olympic qualification, believe they don’t receive enough.\xa0\nThe general sentiment in the sporting fraternity is that the clarion call for Singapore-based corporates to jump in and back our own as they chase their dreams goes largely ignored.\nSchooling’s endorsements are an anomaly and understandably so. He is after all our only Olympic champion, and as an individual, has been a shining example of a brand ambassador.\nBut the lack of corporate interest should come as little surprise.\xa0\nIn a Sport Singapore Sports Index that studied participation trends in 2015 – the latest study available on its site – 48 per cent of Singaporeans said they did not participate in sports because they are “not interested in sports”.\nThat same study revealed that 76 per cent are proud of athletes’ international sporting achievements.\nBUT THERE IS A TRIBE \nBut there are those who still believe in sport.\nSwimming clubs noted a glut of new young members taking to the pool after Schooling’s Olympic win, watched over by eager parents who embraced this new drive they were witnessing in their young dreamers.\nTeong Tzen Wei is one such born-again dreamer of the Schooling effect, and at the Philippines SEA Games, the 22-year-old went out and beat the man who inspired him in the 50m fly.\nAnd even among everyday Singaporeans, the stock of sport has risen. We may not be known as a great sporting nation but the limited success we have had and the efforts our sportsmen and women take to compete in national colours has had a trickle-down effect. It has inspired a deeper ethos of participation in sports across the nation.\xa0\nThere are ultramarathoners, Muay Thai and Brazilian Jujitsu exponents, Spartan racers, and even crazy ones who dive deep into open waters with only a single breath of air for company.\nThey now crowd cross-fit gyms and speak up on social media when sports get judged merely by medals at major games, not by effort or the amount of funds backing it, lending their weight to athletes battling seemingly unfair practices.\nBeing part of the tribe in the past meant thronging to stadiums and hissing at the opposition, but the crowd couldn’t directly speak to our sporting heroes then, we just hoped to bear witness. Being part of the sports tribe in Singapore now is no longer about being a mere spectator. It is about embodying that grit and determination and seeing it manifest in each one of us – professional sports person or amateur.\xa0\xa0\nThey cheer the man next to them perhaps even more than the footballer in the stadium, but they still stroll into stadiums when Hariss Harun and company start to play like Lions, and they still care if Schooling will once again send the Singapore flag atop poles at an Olympic arena. Here in lies the value of sports to Singapore.\nMakes you wonder if sport actually doesn’t matter to Singaporeans anymore, or if it’s merely viewed differently, backed by actions and words strange and unfamiliar to now-chonky folks like me.\nShamir Osman was a former sports journalist for 12 years before crossing the aisle to work in public relations.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Singapore ', '     sports ', '     football ', '     SEA Games ']}"

  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: “I always aim to annihilate the opposition.”\nThose were the words of the late Kobe Bryant, an NBA legend and one of the fiercest competitors the world had ever seen.\nThe sentence sounds harsh, perhaps even wrong, but when taken in the context of the “Mamba Mentality” he coined, it fits seamlessly into the gladiatorial ethos of the sportsman.\nOn at least one level, you can imagine Kobe nodding his head at the Singapore Sports School (SSP) B Division boys who thumped the Assumption Pathway School (APS) 32-0 in the National School Games football competition two weeks ago.\nKOBE’S MAMBA MENTALITY\nThe Mamba Mentality was about winning at all cost, not in the sense of cheating or cutting corners, but paying more than just your dues in terms of preparation and commitment to training, then executing every move honed when you step out onto the sporting arena.\nWith this mentality, Kobe’s teams would respect opponents enough to work harder than they did, then show the same respect in the sporting arena by giving nothing less than their best.\nThe SSP boys did just that, but their massive win has divided opinion in the sporting fraternity in Singapore.\nSPORTS A VEHICLE FOR VALUES\nSome believe SSP should have taken their foot off the pedal, especially after they were reportedly 20-0 up at half-time. Other critics assert that the SSP coaching staff should get sacked for allowing their better-resourced, better-trained kids to run wild and humiliate their opposition.\nI wonder if that is the best approach.\nSuch moves would tell the winning team that it is okay to toy with your opposition, and for the losing side, that there will always be a stop-gap measure to save you when things go horribly wrong.\nBoth are poor lessons to impart, and what is sport if not a vehicle for life values, especially at this - a school-level competition?\nA SYSTEMIC GULF\nThe word from the grapevine is that SSP did not play with their preferred first eleven, and even set conditions before players were allowed to take shots on goal.\nIt also was reported that the SSP players applauded their opponents, with coach Isa Halim addressing the APS players after the game, praising their fighting spirit.\nThat was a decent show of sportsmanship from SSP that has in place a football programme that has produced several national players such as Safuwan Baharudin.\nUnder the programme, their students train up to six times a week, and test themselves against some of the best academies across the world - as close as it gets to living and breathing football in the Singapore school system.\nAPS is a specialised educational institution aimed at transforming and empowering students who are unable to access or complete secondary education to help them achieve personal success.\nFootball is understandably not a dedicated focus for the school that just last year, lost 20-0 to Marsiling Secondary School.\xa0\nWhy then are these two schools, worlds apart in their approach to sport, facing each other in a match where there are seemingly few benefits on offer for everyone involved?\nKID-FIRST APPROACH EXISTS\nBefore Kobe’s tragic death in the helicopter crash that also claimed the life of his daughter Gianna and seven others, the LA Lakers legend had rekindled his love for basketball - through coaching 13-year-old Gianna and her team.\nDespite the monastic approach of his Mamba method that saw him rise at 4am so he could train up to four times a day, Kobe’s approach to coaching was a tad different. It was aimed at providing kids a foundation to help them understand the amount of work and preparation that it takes to be excellent - if it was what they wanted to do.\xa0\nHe called for parents “to put the kid first, not the sport”.\nTo its credit, the Ministry of Education has already moved to implement a more kid-first approach in its National Schools Games, with a tiered competition format that is designed for schools of a similar level to play against each other - once the competition progresses past the preliminary rounds.\nThis is in stark contrast to the zonal system of earlier decades where schools were grouped by location, and those unfortunate to be in the same vicinity as traditional powerhouses could find themselves booted out of the tournament after just three games.\nIn its current format, football sees a five-tiered system that provides schools opportunities to give their students more matches, more game time, and against opponents they are likely to be competitive against.\nThe system could possibly be tweaked even further to prevent such big scores in the preliminary round.\nHARD LESSONS ARE HARDLY BAD LESSONS\nOr perhaps there could just be a management of the different and sometimes difficult lessons that can actually be drawn from situations of a gross mismatch as was the case between SSP and ASP.\nSSP played to the best of their ability - the greatest respect an athlete can give an opponent - against a team not ready to handle their on-field prowess, then showed heart-warming sportsmanship at the end of the game.\nAnd by all accounts, APS matched SSP’s respect for the sport and the sporting arena, by doing their best and not allowing the game to descend into frustrated cheap shots known to occur in amateur league matches here.\nNor did they throw in the towel and walk off the pitch at some point in the game – which would have been tempting for a team of teenagers to do rather than face a more humiliating result – and instead courageously played till the end. That tenacity deserves applause.\nThe APS footballers would have now seen just how far they are away from being a top school-level team, and hopefully acknowledge the work that needs to be put in, if they want to aim for football excellence.\nIt is with this knowledge that they will now go into the next stage of the tiered league format competition - a hard lesson, but hardly a bad lesson to learn.\xa0\xa0\nIt may not be perfect, but it has shown - in this case at least - that with the right approach, even within its systemic limitations, school sports can still deliver values and maybe even sow the seeds for Singapore to grow little Mambas of our own.\nPerhaps we should calm down, let the kids learn for themselves exactly what is required for sporting excellence and annihilate every opponent put in front of them - or at least try to - that is the essence of sport, no?\nShamir Osman was a former sports journalist for 12 years before crossing the aisle to work in public relations.\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     sports ', '     school ', '     football ']}"

      Social networking on wheels: The cycling club that’ll give your career a leg up
  </h1>, 'text': ""They call it the 5AM Club: High achievers who rise before the sun to get a head start on their goals before the rest of the world awakens – a concept coined by leadership coach and elite performance expert Robin Sharma who also wrote a book bearing the same title.\n\n\nSome people may call these people nuts for voluntarily foregoing the possibility of catching a few more Z’s prior to that life-giving ball of gas coming back round to illuminate the sky.\nThese people might also call members of the Rapha Cycling Club (RCC) kinda crazy for choosing to rock up at 5.30am on weekdays to cycle around the city together before heading off to work.\nWhat compels these individuals to take their wheels out before the sun’s up, besides the prospect of exercise, which one can arguably squeeze in at more earthly hours?\n“These days, so many people are looking for community, connection and experiences, and the club does that for our members,” explained Simon Mottram, founder of Rapha, a leading manufacturer of premium apparel designed for cyclists.\n\n\nA post shared by Simon Mottram (@simonmottramrapha)\nThe Singapore chapter of the RCC was established about five years ago and membership is edging towards 300 – impressive for a direct-to-consumer brand (70 per cent of revenue is derived online) with no physical retail presence to speak of in Singapore. The RCC does, however, operate 23 stores around the world, called “Clubhouses”.\n“We talk about it providing memories and friendships, which it does beyond work and social life. This is something extra… A whole new world that people can enjoy together,” Mottram added.\nFor Toby Williams, who joined the Sydney chapter six years ago and has since migrated to Singapore, the unexpected opportunities for networking have proven invaluable.\n“The networking is really something else; you talk to people from all walks of life and careers. Rapha Singapore has helped me gain mentors that I normally wouldn't have met in the corporate world. And since we share a common interest, I get to share my thoughts and challenges on a daily basis,” shared the 38-year-old VP of business development for an advertising tech company.\n\n\nA post shared by Tobes Williams (@tobeswilliams)\nThere are approximately 15,000 RCC members around the world, each inducted into the club at a membership fee of approximately US$100 (S$138) per year.\nA typical RCC member, Mottram described to CNA Luxury on his recent visit to Singapore, is a male professional in his mid-30s, educated, well-travelled and earning a good income, and wants to make time for things he cares about; cycling being one of his key passions.\n“He knows his brands and is quite brand- and design-conscious; he’ll have the right luggage, the right watch, the right footwear,” he elaborated.\nCuriously, Mottram has also observed a big crossover between cycling and architecture and design.\n“We get quite a few people from the creative industries as well. From an aesthetic point of view, bicycles are a beautiful piece of engineering and the kits are always quite interesting,” he said.\n“These days, so many people are looking for community, connection and experiences.” – Simon Mottram\nMEMBERSHIP HAS ITS PRIVILEGES \nThe RCC membership programme used to be reserved for the brand’s best customers but, according to Mottram, it has since evolved to be more inclusive.\n“We realised that’s not the best way of building a community so now it’s really for the people who are most passionate rather than those who are the richest,” he said.\nMembers enjoy a bunch of benefits including first dibs on new Rapha product launches and seasonal sales, and enjoy exclusive access to members-only products and brand experiences. They may also be entitled to discounts and reserved seating at partner cafes and restaurants – during organised events or otherwise.\nThey don’t, however, get any discounts on regular-priced Rapha products ranging from professional cycling apparel to lifestyle wear and adventure clothing, which can cost a pretty penny.\nA Pro Team Insulated Gore-Tex Jacket fabricated using advanced technologies and waterproof materials, for example, retails on Rapha’s website for US$430. The manufacturer of the “world’s best cycling apparel” does, after all, clothe athletes and WorldTour professionals with its sponsorship of the women’s CANYON//SRAM and men’s EF Education First Pro Cycling teams.\nMembers also enjoy access to an app that connects them with a global network of the RCC group rides organised around the world, providing information on the terrain and therefore the level of difficulty of each ride. Membership also includes basic personal injury insurance for when they participate in those rides.\n“[The RCC membership programme is] really for the people who are most passionate rather than those who are the richest.” – Simon Mottram\nMottram fishes out his phone to provide a demonstration of the app and shares how he – the CEO of this global brand – technically can’t register for the next day’s ride as all the spots have been filled. Surely the Singapore chapter can make an exception for their very own OG?\nIt will be Mottram’s second RCC ride in Singapore, and he’s packed in his own grey-and-pink bike in his Rapha luggage for this trip.\nThe group of more than 50 cyclists will be split into two, each led by a Rapha-trained ride leader who will guide them from the start at MacRitchie Reservoir through to Lornie Road en route to Marina Bay Sands, the National Gallery and the Supreme Court where they will take a big group photo before adjourning to partner cafe Chye Seng Huat in Lavender – covering some 40km over two hours or so.\n“There’s something that happens on a bike where you’re generally riding two-by-two; you get the best conversations because you’re facing forward and you’re not looking at each other… There’s something about the rhythm of just doing something together and you have very honest conversations in a way that if you’re in a pub or a bar, it’d be weird,” Mottram said, explaining the allure for a non-cyclist such as myself.\nThe Singapore RCC chapter organises up to five such rides a week, likewise led by a ride leader to ensure riders’ safety.\n“It’s a proper active community. It’s not like a buyer’s club where people sign up and you just get emails. When you ride with us, you get looked after; we train our ride leaders with first aid and on how to lead rides because they need to know how to signal or know what to do if there’s an accident,” he said.\nThe RCC also organises two global summits each year, touted as “the most aspirational event” on cyclists’ calendar. The last one was held in Mallorca, Spain last October, and the next will be hosted in the small town of Hokuto at the foot of the Yatsugatake mountains west of Tokyo, a stone’s throw from the site of the famous\xa0Nobeyama cyclocross race come June.\nMembers can look forward to a long weekend of riding and relaxing activities varying from alpine climbs to onsen visits and tastings at local sake and whiskey distilleries. According to Mottram, all 120 spots sold out within eight hours of the global launch.\n“Cycling is a very social thing; we like to ride together and do stuff together so it seemed to make sense to develop a club around the brand,” said Mottram.\nShared RCC member and banking executive Greg Yeap, who has participated in overseas rides such as in Khao Yai, Thailand: “My primary reason for joining RCC was to improve my fitness but now I’ve forged friendships that I hope will last forever.”\n“There’s something that happens on a bike where you’re generally riding two-by-two; you get the best conversations because you’re facing forward and you’re not looking at each other.” – Simon Mottram\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Fitness ', '     Community ', '     sports ', '     Singapore ']}"

He\'ll be eligible for a contract extension this summer and could enter free agency following the 2020-21 season.\nBut Antetokounmpo addressed his future during the recent all-star break, saying that he plans to remain in Milwaukee as long as the team is winning.\nThe hapless Pistons, who are 29 games behind the Bucks in the standings, were without Blake Griffin, who is out for the season after having knee surgery.\nDetroit is in a rebuilding mode after trading away centre Andre Drummond earlier this month and buying out guard Reggie Jackson.\nThe Pistons appear to have packed it in for this season and are doing a lot of experimenting with their rotations as they seem to set their sights on getting a high draft pick.\n""With a young team, it takes getting smacked upside the head a few times to wake them up a little bit,"" Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. ""Tonight showed everyone how far we still have to go when it comes to building our roster and developing our young players.""\nElsewhere, all-star Trae Young exploded for a career high 50 points as the Atlanta Hawks closed the game with a 10-0 run to defeat the Miami Heat 129-124.\nYoung\'s brilliant performance came in his first game back after making his NBA all-star debut in Chicago.\nCAREER HIGH\nYoung made 18 of 19 free throws and eight of 15 three-pointers to establish the personal best score.\nBam Adebayo, who won the skills competition at the all-star game, had 28 points and a season-high 19 rebounds for Miami, who lost their fifth game in the last six.\nKevin Huerter and De\'Andre Hunter each scored 17 points for Atlanta.\nYoung made two free throws late in the game to help seal the win after teammate Cam Reddish stole the ball from Goran Dragic to put Atlanta up 126-124.\n', 'related_topics': ['     sports ', '     NBA ']}"

      Commentary: To play or not to play. EPL forced to tackle COVID-19
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: By Friday (Mar 13) morning, English football had confirmed that one of its players and a manager were infected with COVID-19.\nAfter Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta tested positive on Mar 12, the next morning it was revealed that Chelsea winger Callum Hudson-Odoi was also infected. The same morning, some reports had also emerged that Arsenal striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was also infected though, at the time of writing, this had not been confirmed by the club yet.\xa0\xa0\nThe COVID-19 outbreak had already brought much of Asian football to a halt and by this week, European authorities were also scrambling to find a way to deal with what is an unprecedented situation in the modern game. That is, however, easier said than done.\nIn China, South Korea and Japan, all games in domestic leagues, continental club competitions and the 2022 World Cup qualifiers have been postponed.\nUntil now, European football authorities have been dealing with this in various ways. Italy, which is currently experiencing the most cases in the continent, has suspended its football leagues until April. In Spain and Germany games are being played behind closed doors.\nEPL FORCED TO REACT\nThe English Premier League (EPL) was, however, trying to continue as normal despite COVID-19 cases continuing to grow in the UK - Mar\xa011 saw the number of confirmed cases reach 460, the biggest rise to date as it surged 83 more than the day before.\xa0\nThe United Kingdom (UK) government did not yet consider football to be a major public health threat. Patrick Vallance, Britain's chief scientific adviser, said on Mar\xa09 that:\xa0\nOne person in a 70,000-seater stadium is not going to infect the stadium. They will infect potentially a few people they have got very close contact with.\nThis official position enabled football to keep going although some reactionary measures were taken. Manchester City’s meeting with Arsenal due to take place on Mar\xa011 was the first English Premier League fixture to be postponed. This was because the Arsenal players and staff had been in contact with Evangelos Marinakis on Feb 27. The owner of Greek club Olympiakos had celebrated on the pitch with his players after a famous win at Arsenal and on Mar\xa010 announced he had been infected with the virus. The London club was however still scheduled to face Brighton on Mar\xa014, at a sold-out stadium.\nHowever, by Friday that was all about to change. Arteta’s infection forced the EPL to cancel Arsenal’s game at Brighton. As Chelsea took the measures to quarantine its players too after Hudson-Odoi tested positive, the Premier League authorities have called for an emergency meeting on Friday to discuss the next steps. It is widely expected that they will suspend the league and postpone all matches.\nPLAYING BEHIND CLOSED DOORS\nUp until this point, there were two different options available though neither was perfect. The first was to play games in empty stadiums and the second was to suspend all football until the coronavirus situation calms down.\nPep Guardiola, manager of current English champions Manchester City is not a fan of playing games with no fans present, likening it to actors in a theatre performing with no audience.\nThe Spaniard predicted that the situation will become more serious in England and asked:\xa0\nIs it worse to play football without the spectators? We do our job for the people and if the people cannot come to watch us, there is no sense.\n\nOn Thursday (Mar 12), just hours after the World Health Organization called the outbreak a global pandemic, Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said that his club would back the suspension of the EPL rather than play behind closed doors.\xa0“I think football is for fans. Without fans we are nothing anyway,” he told media.\nFor both Manchester clubs, suspending the league could also mean that their fierce rivals Liverpool miss winning their 19th league title, though the authorities have not clarified what would happen in that regard.\nBut it is not just about the football experience. The EPL is the richest in the world with its 20 clubs receiving S$4.2 billion in broadcast revenue for last season. Top tier teams may not be reliant on match day income but there are plenty further down England’s football pyramid that can’t afford to miss out on vital income.\nFormer Manchester United star Gary Neville is a co-owner of fourth tier team Salford. “I do not support matches played behind closed doors,” Neville wrote on social media.\xa0\nIf it’s necessary to shut down stadiums the associations must find a way of delaying the season and playing the games when it is safe to do so to protect the revenues for clubs that require this income to survive.\n\nDespite the resistance from some quarters to this measure though, a leaked memo from the Premier League revealed that the game’s authorities had preferred this option to prevent the spread of the virus. With the virus already now making its way into the EPL, that option may no longer be viable as Friday’s meeting will reveal.\nSUSPENSION IS TRICKY\nHowever, suspending the season is controversial also. Most Asian leagues that have been postponed were just starting or about to start which gives authorities more breathing space to reschedule. In contrast, European leagues and competitions are three-quarters finished. The start of the next season is closer than the start of the current campaign.\nFans, especially of clubs such as Liverpool, eager to win a \xa0EPL title for the first time in 30 years, and Leeds, close to promotion back to the Premier League for the first time since 2004, are concerned that suspension could eventually lead to cancellation.\n\xa0\n“The odds of the Premier League season being prematurely curtailed must surely be narrowing,” Simon Chadwick, Professor of Eurasian Sport at Emlyon Business School in Paris, had earlier said.\xa0\nIt's too early to see this as the likely outcome, but one suspects that football will sooner or later have to confront the prospect. The sports calendar is already very packed, hence the opportunities for rescheduling are minimal. Indeed, the deeper we get into March and April, the more likely it is that curtailment will happen.\n\nIf English football does not finish the season, chaos would likely ensue.\n“There would be both competition and legal ramifications,” added Chadwick.\nHow can a decision be made? Who would win the league? Who may or may not get relegated and promoted? This would cause major legal issues, which explains why the Premier League will try to leave any such decisions as late as possible.\n\nAn added complication is that Europe’s summer is already full due to the European Championships. Held every four years, Europe’s biggest sporting event is due to take place from June 12 to July\xa012, in 12 different countries.\nIt may be that the 24-team tournament will have to be postponed. UEFA, the organisers, are insisting however that this will not happen. On Mar\xa010, the Associated Press reported that UEFA was asking governments across Europe to ensure that the tournament would go ahead as scheduled and with fans.\nIt looks like something will have to give. Playing behind closed doors may have been a viable long-term solution before the infections set in.\xa0 But suspension may be the only option now, even if it only is able to work if the summer is kept free for clubs to play the rescheduled domestic fixtures, and not withstanding other ramifications.\nAs the virus spreads in the EPL, football bosses in England are rushing to make some difficult decisions.\nJohn Duerden has lived in Asia for 20 years and covers the region’s sporting scene.

      Commentary: Organisers may have little choice than to cancel the Tokyo Olympics
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: On Tuesday (Mar 17), it was announced that one of the biggest sporting events in the world, football’s European Championships, will be postponed from this summer to June 2021.\xa0\xa0\nThe decision to postpone the quadrennial tournament, which was due to be staged in 12 European cities and had received 28.3 million ticket requests by last month, was seen as inevitable as the coronavirus outbreak moved close to 200,000 global infections.\nPRESSURE MOUNTS ON THE OLYMPICS\nWith all the major domestic European leagues suspending their seasons, removing the main summer event was the only way to give those leagues some much-needed breathing space.\nThe decision placed even more attention on what will happen with the Tokyo Olympics Games that are due to start on Jul 24 - just six weeks later. The possibility of similarly\xa0postponing, rather than cancelling, is increasingly discussed.\nYet less than an hour after European football’s governing body made the announcement, the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which organises the Games, released a statement saying that nothing had changed.\n""The IOC remains fully committed to the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020, and with more than four months to go before the Games, there is no need for any drastic decisions at this stage,"" it said.\xa0\nAny speculation at this moment would be counter-productive. The IOC encourages all athletes to continue to prepare for the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 as best they can.\nLESS FEASIBLE TO KEEP IT GOING\nThe option of keeping the Olympics going, though still on the table, appears to be fading away quickly.\nNotwithstanding the cancellation of major sporting events\xa0such as Formula One, tennis and golf, having the Olympics at this stage is a major public health risk.\nWith countries around the world closing down borders in an attempt to limit the spread of the virus and airlines grounding aircraft, it remains to be seen if it will actually be physically possible for spectators to get to Japan.\nYet it is not just about the fans. Over 15,000 athletes are expected to participate in the Olympics and the following Paralympics. According to the IOC, only 57 per cent of athletes have secured their places at the Olympics with the rest still yet to qualify.\nWith qualification events around the world being suspended - boxing announced its decision on Monday (Mar 16) - deciding who makes it to the Olympics provides another headache.\nFor the remaining 43 per cent of places, the IOC will work with the international federations to make any necessary and practical adaptations to their respective qualification systems for Tokyo 2020,\xa0the Olympic body said.\nEven attempts to catch athletes that take performance-enhancing drugs could be affected with the UK’s Anti-Doping Chief Executive Nicole Sapstead admitting that the spread of the virus would mean less testing.\nTOO BIG TO SHIFT\nOf course, the Olympics is of a bigger scale and nature than the other\xa0sports events that have been cancelled or postponed recently..\xa0\nAt the end of 2019, it was estimated that the total cost to Japan of staging the event would be around S$17.89 billion.\xa0According to a recent report by SMBC Nikko Securities, the games not going ahead could contribute to the country’s annual GDP growth falling by 1.4 per cent, spurred by lower corporate revenues than last year.\nThis makes it more understandable that all parties, particularly Japan, are keen to see the Games go ahead as planned\xa0and not cancel it altogether.\nPostponement, though\xa0an option, may even be more challenging than cancelling the Games altogether.\nAccording to the IOC, 4.5 million tickets have been sold and 80,000 volunteers have been enlisted. There are major sponsorship and broadcasting commitments that also have to be considered even if postponement, and not cancellation, is opted for.\nIt is unclear if the same corporate sponsors will remain at\xa0the table should the Games be postponed, especially when the business environment becomes more challenging due to COVID-19.\nIn addition, with Japan experiencing winter from the fourth quarter onwards, even if we see the tapering off of the disease by then, it would be difficult to have many of the events in the Games in low temperatures.\xa0\nAll of which make the Games’ postponement more than a straightforward decision.\nMoreover, with many experts predicting that we may not see the peak of COVID-19 until the end of the year, any decision on postponement would have to take this into account. If the postponement of the European Championships by a year is any indication, then it may be best to shift the Olympics to 2021.\nHowever, one obstacle to postponing the Games to next year is that IOC’s agreement with Japan was to have the Olympics in 2020. Meaning that any rescheduling to next year would require both the IOC and the Japanese government going back to the drawing board to renegotiate a new contract. It is uncertain if both parties would be willing to spend the resources needed to do so again.\nHence that leaves a small window of August-October - since that will still meet contractual obligations and pre-empt the winter season – provided there are signs by June or July that COVID-19 is under control. Seeing these challenges in postponing the Olympics, it may be more feasible for the organisers to cancel it.\xa0\xa0\xa0\nJAPAN’S STANCE SOFTENING\nThe IOC’s public determination to continue with the Olympics this summer though reflects what was, until the past few days at least, a similar resolve in Japan.\nAlready however, the effects of the virus can be seen in the build-up. The Olympic torch relay, the traditional precursor to the opening ceremony, has been scaled back with many stages behind held without spectators.\nJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has repeatedly said that the Games will go ahead as planned but after a video conference call with world leaders on Monday, his statement was seen as vaguer than before. He refused to answer questions from the media as to whether there had been talk of a delay especially as United States President Donald Trump had suggested such a move on Mar 12.\n""I want to hold the Olympics and Paralympics perfectly, as proof that the human race will conquer the new coronavirus, and I gained support for that from the G-7 leaders,"" Abe told reporters.\nEven though Abe did not talk about a possible postponement, other prominent voices in the country have acknowledged that the Games not going ahead in July is a possibility.\n“Not thinking about worst-case scenarios won’t eliminate the risk of them materialising,” leading politician Shigeru Ishiba said.\xa0\nThe government must start thinking now about what to do in case the Games are postponed or cancelled.\nOn Mar 11, Haruyuki Takahashi, a member of the Olympics organising committee’s executive board said that a postponement may be the most feasible option, though he was slapped down by Yoshiro Mori, the chief of the committee.\nThe Japanese public also seem to be coming to terms with the possibility that the games may be rescheduled.\xa0 A poll run by Asahi newspaper on Tuesday showed that 63 per cent of respondents thought that a delay was the best course of action.\nTIME IS TICKING\nThe IOC may be correct that there is no need to make a decision too soon but the deadline can’t be too far away.\nThe head of the French Olympic Committee said on Monday that the coronavirus situation must be past its peak by the end of May for the games to go ahead in July.\n“My feeling is that if we’re still in the crisis by the end of May, I can’t see how the Games can happen (on time),” Denis Masseglia said.\xa0\nIf we are beyond the peak and the situation is getting better questions will arise about who qualifies, but we will find the least worst solution.\nThat may be indicative then that the Olympics is unlikely to continue this summer since experts say the peak of COVID-19 may only come at the end of the year. And with postponing likely to be more troublesome than cancelling the event, both the IOC and Japan may opt for the latter decision.\xa0\nSince the modern Olympics started in 1896, only three summer games have not gone ahead as scheduled. The 1916, 1940 and 1944 events were cancelled due to World War I and World War II.\nThere have been no peacetime cancellations or postponements but it appears that history is set to be made this year. It would appear difficult for Japan to hold the Olympics this summer with public health still at risk.\nEuropean football did just that on Monday. It may well be that the Olympics will have to do the same or even decide to cancel. There is little time and few options remain.\nJohn Duerden has lived in Asia for 20 years and covers the region’s sporting scene.

      No gym? No problem! Try these challenging online workouts at home
  </h1>, 'text': 'I may be an introvert but there is one activity that I much prefer doing in a group setting – exercising. There is something about suffering collectively with a bunch of people in a room I cannot escape that motivates me to do one more set of push-ups, punch that boxing bag with extra gusto or to try a deep backbend that I would never do on my own.\nThis is why over the past decade, since I began practicing yoga and exercising regularly, I have always maintained memberships to gyms and studios. But over the past few weeks, as the government has progressively stepped up measures on safe distancing and implemented a 28-day stay-home “circuit breaker”, group workouts and gym-going have become a thing of the past, at least for now.\nStill, while I willingly gave up going to the gym for the greater good, what I will not allow to fall to the wayside is my health and fitness. More than ever, it is during a pandemic, that each individual needs to care even more about this.\nIn Singapore, we might still be allowed to exercise in parks but to enhance safe distancing in our population-dense country, I intend to stay home as much as possible.\nThankfully, there are still plenty of ways to get moving even when mostly confined within four walls. For starters, there have long been a plethora of fitness apps and YouTube channels for those who need some “fitspo”. Every now and then, I have turned to Fitness Blender’s free calorie-busting videos when I am unable to make time to travel to the gym.\nNow, as exercise instructors and fitness businesses try to adapt to this unprecedented situation by creating their own online content – much of which is currently free – there is literally a buffet of exercise options at one’s fingertips.\nDetermined not to pack on what I am cheekily calling (COVID-)19 pounds by the time gyms are finally allowed to resume operations, I dove headlong into the world of digital workouts, the more intense the better.\nThe first session I tried was called Cardio Queen by Brad Wharakura, a Hong Kong-based instructor at Pure Fitness, which is offering a range of daily Instagram Live classes.\nWhen I started the live feed, I was delighted to see the instructor all decked out in drag gear including make-up, a wig and an 80s-style exercise outfit.\nUnapologetically fabulous and exuberant, he proceeded to lead a 45-minute session of heart stopping circuit exercises, often offering tips on how to use home items, such as water bottles instead of weights or chairs for inclined push-ups to intensify the workout.\nLittle did I know, the most challenging part was yet to come. At the cool down, the flamboyant instructor broke out into a Vogue-ing sequence, a dance form popularised by drag queens.\nTo keep with the spirit of things, I too tried to mimic his sashays, shimmies and high kicks. Well, after watching a video that my amused partner filmed, let’s just say I should never be allowed to Vogue in public.\nTime to get serious. I downloaded the Nike Training Club app, which is currently offering its premium content free of charge.\nIts library of about 185 workouts feature bodyweight sessions, yoga classes and full-equipment workouts. I zoomed in on the athlete workout routines featuring famous names like gymnast Simone Biles and footballer Cristiano Ronaldo and picked The Decathlete session by Ashton Eaton, who curated this series of drills based on how he trains for this gruelling 10-event athletic sport.\nNot surprisingly, the sequence, which includes mountain climbers, lateral step-ups, broad jumps and planks, more than exhausted all key muscle groups. However, I wish the video demos were conducted by Eaton himself instead of some generic fitness models to dial up the entertainment factor.\nEnter Cntr, an app by actor Chris Hemsworth, which features the team of trainers, chefs and mindfulness experts that the Thor star trains with. As luck would have it, the home page was promoting a workout featuring Hemsworth, which I promptly started.\nI figured, if I am going to sweat, I might as well do it in the (virtual) presence of a Hollywood hunk right? Well, it didn’t quite work out that way. About 30 seconds into trying to keep my balance while doing jumping lunges, bear crawls and squats while carrying dumbbells, I stopped gazing dreamily at the screen and shifted my focus to not falling flat on my face.\nThen, to my excitement, I discovered that Cirque du Soleil performers and personal trainers actually post exercise videos on their YouTube channel. I mean, who doesn’t want the lithe yet strong bodies of these acrobatic performers?\nThere are only 12 workouts on their playlist but with each one focusing on a specific goal, they have all the bases covered. My favourite is the ominously titled Extreme Abs Workout which clocks a mere seven minutes but might just be the most painful minutes of my life.\nIf you do this correctly, you are not supposed to relax your abs for the entire duration of the video. I’ve done this about five times since and I am still not able to get through the routine without pausing for air and uttering a choice expletive or two.\nUltimately, after putting myself through the paces on all these different platforms, I found myself craving something familiar. It is certainly fun to try different workouts with various instructors but there is nothing like going to class with a teacher who you feel an affinity for.\nLuckily, although my regular yoga studio, Pure Yoga, is currently closed, they are now live streaming classes on Instagram. I happily cleared my schedule to make time for back-to-back sessions by two of my favourite yoga teachers – Arun Rana and Sandy Shum.\nI’ll admit that seeing their familiar faces pop up on the screen and listening to their voice cues, which I have grown accustomed to over the years, made me shed a few bittersweet tears.\nOver two hours, spurred on by their instructions and the in-chat comments made by various other regular students, I had my best sweat session in these few weeks.\nI cannot wait for the day when I am able to safely return to the studio and to enjoy their classes in person. But for now, it is reassuring to know that thanks to modern technology, I am only a few taps of my phone screen away from the people who have kept me in fighting fit condition over the years.\n', 'related_topics': ['     health ', '     Fitness ', '     Wellness ', '     Wellbeing ', '     sports ', '     coronavirus ', '     COVID-19 ']}"

      Malaysian national athletes foresee challenging return to training after movement control order
  </h1>, 'text': ""\nKUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian athletes foresee a challenging return to regular training\xa0after the movement control order (MCO), despite attempts to maintain fitness at home with customised programmes and being\xa0creative with limited equipment.\nWhen interviewed by CNA, sailor Khairulnizam Mohd Afendy noted that\xa0home-based training would only aid him to maintain his stamina and not gain it.\n“The lack of endurance will affect (training) after this MCO.\n“I would mostly need to gain (back) the skills on water, as I have spent nearly six weeks without water training. It will be difficult to start again, especially to get the feeling of being on the boat and getting used to the surroundings,” the Asian Games silver medalist\xa0explained.\nSimilarly, diver Ng Yan Yee said: “It is maybe going to be difficult to go back to regular training. It has been quite difficult training at home without\xa0much facilities.”\nTRAINING WITH TECHNOLOGY\nDespite the constraints, the National Sports Council has attempted to keep up the training tempo for the athletes, with some aid from technology.\xa0\nThe council's\xa0athletes division director Jefri Ngadirin told CNA that with all training centres shut, coaches have been asked\xa0to design\xa0training programmes for those under their charge during the home confinement period, which will last until Apr 28.\n“Some (athletes) have a single session training just in the morning while others have double sessions.\n“The coaches are monitoring\xa0the athletes via Whatsapp or Zoom calls,” he said, adding that athlete compliance has improved tremendously since the first phase of the MCO.\nJefri said the home-based training sessions are focused on maintaining fitness levels, instead of developing specific skills as the athletes cannot access their usual facilities.\nThe first phase of the MCO, implemented to break the COVID-19 infection chain, was scheduled to end on Mar 31, but was later\xa0pushed back to Apr 14.\nUnder MCO, schools and non-essential businesses are closed. People are urged to stay at home to minimise contact as health authorities rush against the clock to contain the spread of the virus.\nSeveral locations with a large number of cases were placed under an enhanced MCO, which further restricted the residents’ movement.\nLast Friday, Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin announced that the MCO will be further extended until Apr 28.\nGETTING CREATIVE\nConsidering\xa0limited resources and space, the athletes had to find creative methods to work out effectively.\n“Being at home allows me to get creative with my training plans,” said\xa0Ng, who is also an Asian Games silver medalist.\nWhen asked how she was coping without access to a pool, the diver replied that\xa0she used whatever she had to emulate her pool surroundings.\n“My training methods include imitation, strength training, headstands, stretching and foam rolling,” she said.\nKhairulnizam, the sailor, also said that he is\xa0making the best of the equipment he has\xa0at home.\n“With the limited equipment, most of the exercise I do is using body weights and resistance bands.\n“I have also been doing some sailing-specific hiking and sheeting exercise,” he added.\nHe has also asked the National Sports Council for some endurance training equipment, such as a rowing machine.\nSMALL NUMBER OF ATHLETES SUFFER FROM DEPRESSION\nAlthough efforts by the sports council have helped the athletes to stay fit during this trying period, it also noted that a small number of them have been affected by being cooped up at home.\nJefri told CNA that based on a survey done by the council,\xa097 per cent of the 712 national athletes were coping well during the MCO period.\n“However, about 1.5 per cent of them have told us that they were feeling depressed and pressured from being at home,” he said.\nWhen asked on the help rendered to this small group, Jefri said the council has arranged for psychological assistance to be made accessible to all 712 athletes.\n“They are free to call and seek help whenever they need,” he said.\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Malaysia ', '     COVID-19 ', '     sports ']}"

      Commentary: COVID-19 will plunge EPL clubs into financial woes
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The English Premier League (EPL) was suspended on Mar 13 after Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta and Chelsea winger Callum Hudson-Odoi both tested positive for COVID-19.\nAfter more than a month of its suspension, there is much discussion now on how the clubs can survive financially and what the future holds for the world’s most popular football league.\nFEELING THE FINANCIAL HEAT\nMuch of that discussion hinges on how the current EPL season will culminate – will it resume after a period of suspension, and when that may be, or if it will be cancelled and voided?\nWith deaths from the virus in the United Kingdom climbing to over 11,000 on Apr 14, a restart is unlikely anytime soon.\nJust like economies, industries and companies are reeling from the effects of the coronavirus, the football industry is not immune either. Even the richest league in the world – the EPL – is already seeing the financial strains of a sudden and uncertain disruption.\nThe 20 teams participating in the EPL raked in a total\xa0broadcasting\xa0income of US$10.95\xa0billion\xa0for the 2016 to 2019 period. This large sum meant that even smaller clubs such as Burnley received US$130\xa0million in revenue from television and prize money in the 2018 to 2019 season alone.\nThat does not mean that clubs are all sitting on vast reserves of cash\xa0as only 12 of the 20 teams in the EPL posted a profit in the 2018 financial year.\nThe thing is these clubs have a high cost structure, with a majority of those costs in the form of salaries. For instance, at the end of the 2017 to 2018 season, the last full campaign with confirmed data, the EPL’s\xa0total\xa0ratio of wages to revenue increased to 60 per cent from 55 per cent the previous year.\nCrystal Palace, Everton, Bournemouth, Leicester City and Southampton\xa0had the\xa0top five highest ratios ranging\xa0from 75 per cent to 78 per cent.\xa0\nA DELAY IN RESTARTING\nThese high salary costs mean that despite the season being currently suspended, clubs are still facing substantial costs as staff wages are still being paid.\nWith high wage to revenue ratios, if the current season continues to be suspended past June - when the Premier League hopes to resume -\xa0then some clubs are going to face serious financial problems.\nIf the current season, three-quarters finished when it was suspended, is cancelled and does not finish at all then Burnley\xa0could lose as much as US$62.1\xa0million in television, match day and commercial revenue.\n""The fact of the matter is, if we don’t finish the season and there isn’t a clear start date for next season, we, as a club, will run out of money by August,”\xa0Burnley Chairman Mike Garlick told the media\xa0on Apr\xa04.\nHIGH WAGE COSTS\nWhile player salaries make up the bulk of outgoings, modern Premier League clubs have substantial non-playing staff.\xa0\nManchester United, whose goalkeeper David De Gea is reportedly the highest paid player in the league at an astonishing US$465,000 a week,\xa0has 900 employees and have announced that all will be paid in full during the season’s suspension.\xa0\nOther clubs are going down different routes in trying to cut costs and this issue has proven to be controversial.\nNewcastle United were the first in the Premier League to put non-playing staff on furlough - that is temporary\xa0leave. This means,\xa0as\xa0part of measures announced by the United Kingdom in March, that the government will subsidise 80 per cent of those salaries up to US$3,107 with the employers providing the rest.\nNewcastle, like Norwich City, will top up the remaining 20 per cent to ensure that staff receive their full salary.\nThere has been plenty of debate as to whether clubs should still be paying their star players millions a month while making use of taxpayer funds to\xa0pay\xa0other\xa0wages but some turned to the government assistance in a bid to not fall deep into financial losses.\nTHE BIG ONES NEED HELP TOO\nEven big clubs like Liverpool face financial risks with the season suspension and turned to furlough to help its cash flow situation.\nHowever, Liverpool’s decision to do that caused a major storm. The\xa0club, reportedly the seventh richest in the world - it recorded a profit of US$52 million last season\xa0- announced on Apr 4 that it would also use the government assistance scheme. Former players and commentators criticised the move.\nTwo days later the decision was reversed with Liverpool\'s Chief Executive Peter Moore saying: ""We believe we came to the wrong conclusion last week and are truly sorry for that.""\n""Despite the fact we were in a healthy position prior to this crisis, our revenues have been shut off yet our outgoings remain,"" said Moore.\xa0“...The club continues to prepare for a range of different scenarios, around when football can return to operating as it did before the pandemic.\xa0These scenarios range from best case to worst, and everything in between.”\nThe worst case scenarios of the current suspension sees it last well into the second-half of 2020. That will mean that it will become more difficult for clubs like Burnley to avoid the hard decisions and warnings as financial survivability becomes a real issue.\nA POORER LEAGUE\nEven if short-term survival is assured and the league restarts, it is possible that there is less money around the sport.\nWith economic slowdown around the world, millions losing jobs and the prospect of a severe depression, clubs will be concerned that sponsors\xa0are going to be harder to find or keep.\nFans are likely to have\xa0less money in their pockets and ticket prices may have to be reduced while clubs may also have to refund or compensate ticket holders for matches that had been postponed during this suspension period.\nBroadcasters such as Sky Sports and BT Sport\xa0could also lose revenue from a drop in subscription if the economic downturn causes widespread unemployment and income loss as well as advertising revenue from corporations that may need to cut their spending to stay afloat.\xa0\nThis could cause an existential threat to the league in its present form as it relies heavily on broadcasting revenue.\nIf that happens, then many of the clubs in the EPL may be cash-strapped and forced to trim their squads or sell their highest-paid players.\nYet there may not be many options for these players to go to with the grim situation likely to be similar\xa0in all the major leagues\xa0across Europe such as\xa0in Spain, Germany, France and Italy.\nOf course what could be worse for the clubs than an extended suspension of the league is if it is cancelled without being completed. If the season is not finished then the collective loss to the 20 EPL clubs is estimated to be US$1.36 billion. That may just be the beginning.\n“Anyone who hasn’t managed the balance sheet properly is going to be in trouble,” an EPL adviser told the Financial Times this week.\xa0\n“There are clubs out there who will not come out the other side. This is going to be the end of the game for a lot, including in the Premier League.”\xa0\nIt appears that whichever decision the EPL takes – to extend its suspension or cancel the current season altogether – the top flight of English football may end up looking like a much poorer version of the billion-dollar industry we have come to know.\nA quick end to COVID-19 is something that the bosses and players of EPL clubs will be hoping for too, just like the rest of us.\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\nJohn Duerden has lived in Asia for 20 years and covers the region’s sporting scene.

      Commentary: The EPL needs extra-time before it can kick-off again
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: On May 18, a day after the 2019 to 2020 English Premier League (EPL) season was originally scheduled to finish, clubs decided to return to training in an attempt to restart the coronavirus-ravaged campaign in June and finish all outstanding 92 games by the end of July.\nThe announcement came just minutes after the Scottish Premier League - just north of the border - decided to abandon its season.\nWith the COVID-19 playing havoc with sporting competitions, time will tell which of these options is best.\nPROJECT RESTART\nThere is no doubt that the EPL commencing phase one of “Project Restart” - its road map to a full return - is the easy part. This involves limited training from May 19, provided that all who are involved test negative for the coronavirus, with contact not yet permitted.\nIt is the beginning of a long and tricky journey for the EPL, the most watched football league in the world. Starting limited training is one thing, playing full games is another.\n“Phase one is social distancing, individual training with a coach. That’s no problem, that’s like going to the park,” Watford’s captain, Troy Deeney, told British media.\n“Phase two will be next week: Six days’ worth of training, three to six people training together with contact, and then six days after that you’re going into 11 versus 11 and you can’t social distance with 11 versus 11.”\nThe United Kingdom (UK) has been hard-hit by the coronavirus with over 34,000 official deaths, though some estimates put that figure closer to 60,000. England is still in lockdown with non-essential shops and schools currently closed.\nOn May 14 however, the British government opened the door for the EPL to restart in June.\n""It is now up to the football authorities to agree and finalise the detail of their plans, and there is combined goodwill to achieve this for their fans, the football community and the nation as a whole,” said the government’s Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden following a meeting with football authorities.\nINCENTIVES FOR THE EPL RETURNING\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that the return of sport would give the nation a “much-needed morale boost.”\nThere are more concrete reasons for the Premier League to return and finish the season. Reports suggest that a failure to do so will amount to the league having to refund broadcasters around £340 million (S$593 million).\nEuropean governing body UEFA has given leagues until May 25 to present a roadmap to restart.\nIf that deadline is missed, though reports in England suggest that it could be extended if necessary, English clubs may be unable to participate in the lucrative and prestigious UEFA Champions League and Europa League competitions next season.\n\n“The reality is that people have managed without football for more than a month now and there’s a real danger that unless the momentum can be regained and fans can begin to watch matches on TV again, the impetus will be lost and the draw of football will be diminished in the long-term,” Football finance expert Gerald Krasner and former chairman of Leeds United said earlier in May.\n“If that was to happen, the television money would soon desert the game, too.”\nSAFETY CONCERNS\nYet high-profile players have voiced concerns about returning to action when people are still dying from the virus in significant numbers.\nTottenham Hotspur’s Danny Rose made his feelings clear on May 12 on a British talk show. ""Football shouldn\'t even be spoken about until the numbers have dropped massively,"" said the England player. ""People\'s lives are at risk.""\nDeeney believes that the majority of players are not just worried about playing competitive games but are even concerned about moving from phase one to phase two of training.\nThere are other issues too, such as those raised by Norwich City captain Grant Hanley. “How do we travel to games? Where do we stay? What are the hotels? How can we guarantee hotels are going to be safe for us to be in? Ultimately it’s putting your family at risk that is the main concern and that’s the worry I think all the teams will have at this minute.”\nOn Monday (May 18), the EPL said in a statement that it would follow medical advice every step of the way. “Strict medical protocols of the highest standard will ensure everyone returns to training in the safest environment possible,” the statement read.\n“The health and well-being of all participants is the Premier League’s priority, and the safe return to training is a step-by-step process.”\nWhile other European leagues such as France and the Netherlands have cancelled their seasons, Spanish teams are back in training and there was more encouragement for the EPL as the Bundesliga restarted its season on Saturday (May 16).\nThe games in Germany, played behind closed doors as is likely to be the case for any football league wanting to play for some time to come, went off without a hitch.\nThere were “social distancing” goal celebrations, substitutes wearing masks and sat apart with no handshakes.\xa0\nIf there is no resulting spike in cases then that will be enough reason for the \xa0EPL to be optimistic too though the number of deaths in Germany, at around 8,000, is significantly less than in the UK.\nAround 1.4 million people in the UK watched German club Borussia Dortmund defeat Schalke 4-0, a figure that is five times higher than the previously most-watched Bundesliga game this season.\nSuch figures will give the EPL more incentive to return in June but there is still much to do before the likes of Liverpool, Manchester United and Arsenal take the pitch once more.\nDownload our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the COVID-19 outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\nJohn Duerden has lived in Asia for 20 years and covers the region’s sporting scene.

      Commentary: COVID-19 has relegated sports tourism from a slam dunk year to a no-show
  </h1>, 'text': 'KUALA LUMPUR: Last week, the 2020 World Sports Tourism Congress was due to take place in Lloret de Mar, Spain.\xa0\nUnsurprisingly, it was postponed.\nConventions are prohibited everywhere, and precious little tourism is occurring anywhere.\xa0\nTo make things worse, sports travel also relies on venue-specific participation, and attendance is banned even at the few professional sports matches currently taking place around the globe.\nIt wasn’t supposed to be this way: 2020 was primed as a blockbuster year for sports-related travel.\nTokyo was ready to host the Olympic Games while 12 cities in Europe prepared to stage the 2020 UEFA European Championship football tournament.\nInstead, COVID-19 shunted both this year’s major sporting events into 2021.\nA HIGH-GROWTH TRAVEL SECTOR\nTravelling to experience the thrill of live sporting action has witnessed huge growth in the past decade.\nAccording to the World Travel Organization (UNWTO), the global sports tourism industry is worth US$800 million – amounting to about 10 per cent of the global tourism pie.\n“More and more tourists are interested in sport activities during their trips, whether sports are the main objective of travel or not,” says the World Travel Organization (UNWTO), which organises the World Sports Tourism Congress.\nIt adds that “Sports events can be a catalyst for tourism development if successfully leveraged in terms of destination branding, infrastructure development and other economic and social benefits.”\nFrom being a niche sector, sports travel has entered the mainstream.\nMany national tourism boards, such as in Australia and Singapore, have dedicated sports travel sections on their websites, and specialist sports tour firms and premium ticket sellers regularly exhibit at travel shows.\nThe increasing lure of sports tourism is also reflected through the growing linkage between travel brands and major sports event sponsorships.\xa0\nFor example, Airbnb is an official Tokyo Olympics sponsor and Booking.com is an official partner of the UEFA European Championships.\nAirlines are also closely aligned to major events. Emirates Airline is an associate partner of the Australian Open tennis tournament, while Qatar Airways was an official partner of the 2019 FIFA Women’s World Cup in France.\nIn 2018, an executive from Spain’s La Liga made a football tourism presentation at ITB Asia, the region’s largest travel trade show, in Singapore.\nIn addition, top sports clubs and franchises, tournament and TV rights holders and sponsors have become proficient at marketing sports travel experiences.\nThese often include match-day tickets, guided stadium tours, player meet-and-greet sessions and exclusive take-home souvenirs.\nBut a high hurdle exists for sports tourism to recover. For leisure and business travel, COVID-19 travel bans, lockdowns and quarantines removed the critical demand factor.\nA phased lifting of these restrictions should unlock at least some pent-up demand.\nThe same demand constraints exist in sports tourism, but they are compounded by a supply deficit.\xa0\nApart from a handful of football leagues playing games in empty stadiums and charity golf events in the US, no top-level sport is taking the field.\nSUMMER WITHOUT SPORTS\nThe Tokyo Olympics and UEFA European Championships have created a large hole in sports tour scheduling.\nThe Olympics is an interesting case, because hosting the Games rarely generates the tourism flows that host cities expect.\xa0\nThis is often due to over-pricing of hotel rooms and flights, and ticket allocation measures that favour domestic fans over incoming visitors.\nHost governments pair the sporting action with a relentless two-week tourism promotion campaign showcasing the country’s diverse attributes to TV viewers worldwide.\nThe goal is to incentivise more tourists to visit later in the year, once the gold medals have been won, packed and shipped.\nIn short, the Olympics allows the host country to showcase its tourism offerings to the rest of the world.\nBy contrast, the UEFA European Championships would have generated large tourism flows as football is a very tribal sport that attracts stadiums of fans.\xa0\nMoreover, the tournament is more of a travel event as games are held in many different major cities so there is more of a multi-destination tourism experience.\nPlayed during Europe’s peak season months of June and July, it brings together the continent’s 24 top national teams to play at marquee stadiums in 12 tourism-friendly cities, such as Amsterdam, Budapest, Copenhagen, London, Rome and St Petersburg.\nAdvance ticket sales were impressive - around 3 million tickets were on sale and UEFA reported that it had received 28 million ticket applications - while bars, cafes, hotels, tour guides and ride-sharing apps in each city were expecting a stellar summer.\nBut the Olympics and UEFA 2020 are not the only signature sporting events unable to deliver significant tourism spend this time round.\nThere will be no Tour de France or Wimbledon this summer, and several F1 Grand Prix races are postponed. The Indian Premier League missed its prime April slot, although it may still be played in October.\nIn Singapore, the International Champions Cup football tournament, which entices Europe’s star-studded teams to play at the National Stadium – and is supported by the Singapore Tourism Board – is taking an enforced year out as large-scale events and public gatherings are still prohibited by the government due to COVID-19.\nFootball is facing a spiralling financial shock from COVID-19.\xa0\nEurope’s four biggest football leagues – all of which regularly attract tourist fans from around the world – have worked hard to restart their truncated seasons.\xa0\nAt present, Germany’s Bundesliga is playing matches in closed stadiums with piped-in crowd noise, with Spain’s La Liga following suit on Jun 8, England’s Premier League on Jun 17 and Italy’s Serie A on Jun 20.\xa0\nSILENT STADIUMS UNTIL 2021?\nLooking ahead, the US Open golf major has been postponed until mid-September, while Australia retains hopes of hosting the 2020 T20 Cricket World Cup in October.\xa0\nNeither event is certain to go ahead \xa0but if they do, spectator numbers will either be heavily reduced or, more likely, locked out as general anxiety and fears of COVID-19 will curtail attendance.\nSimilar uncertainty surrounds the Singapore Grand Prix – whose organisers have said they are unwilling to stage a closed-door race – and the rescheduled French Open tennis tournament in September, which also faces a potential player boycott as it is due to be staged only a week after the US Open finishes.\nThe sports and tourism industries are palpably aware that rebooting sports-related travel is impossible while public access to matches and events is prohibited.\nMuch depends on the feared coronavirus second wave, which would likely hit in the later part of the year.\nThe US’ top infectious diseases expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, who is the Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said in a public webinar earlier this month that a second round of COVID-19 cases is ""inevitable"" as “the virus is so transmissible and it\'s globally spread"", and that Americans should prepare for ""a bad fall and a bad winter.""\nEven without a viral resurgence, the travel fear factor is hard to forecast – especially for long-haul trips.\nTravel considerations aside, some sports leagues do not even foresee a return to stadium crowds until at least 2021.\nSo, for now, travel and sports fans have little option but to switch on the TV, and imagine ourselves sitting among the cardboard cut-out spectators placed around Germany’s grand football stadiums or watch re-runs of their favourite sporting teams and heroes.\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\nGary Bowerman is Director of Check-in Asia, and an experienced Asia tourism and consumer analyst and media commentator.

      Veteran athletics coach found guilty of molesting athlete 7 years ago at Tampines   Stadium
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: A veteran athletics coach with 35 years of experience\xa0was found guilty on Wednesday (Jun 3) of molesting a teenage athlete twice in 2013.\nLoh Siang Piow, 75, also known as Loh Chan Pew, was convicted of two charges of using criminal force on the woman at Tampines Stadium in order to outrage her modesty.\xa0\nHe first molested the woman, then 18 years old, in early March 2013.\nThey were on a bench along a corridor leading to the gate below the spectators\' waiting area when he\xa0molested her while massaging the back of her thighs.\nHe committed the second offence that same month,\xa0on a massage bed inside an equipment room\xa0at the now-defunct stadium.\nAgain, he molested her while massaging the back of her thighs.\nThe verdict came years after the trial began, with District Judge Marvin Bay finding that the defence was not able to establish its alibi defence.\nLoh denied ever molesting the girl, and said he never conducted any individual training sessions with her. However, the judge found that his defence lawyers failed to show that he was involved in other activities on the dates of both charges.\nThe case was complicated by the fact that the building housing the stadium no longer exists, with no independent witnesses and the fact that the victim filed a report only in July 2016.\nGIRL WAS AN ASPIRING NATIONAL ATHLETE\nThe victim was an aspiring national-level athlete who had some success in short-distance sprints.\nShe began training intensely in early 2013. She was coached by Loh, who also trained\xa0athletes from various schools, including a junior college and a university.\nThe teen testified that Loh organised one-on-one training sessions for her about\xa0two months after she started training under him, from end-January 2013 to mid-March 2013.\nThese were supposedly organised to improve her performance at upcoming competitions, and the teen initially felt lucky to have the\xa0one-on-one training.\nShe went for the sessions on Sundays, and the first one went uneventfully. Loh offered a cool down massage, and the girl agreed, thinking nothing of it.\nAs she lay prone, the coach massaged her calves from her ankles to her knees, and nothing out of the ordinary happened.\nHowever\xa0after another training session,\xa0Loh massaged the back of her calves to her thighs.\xa0\nThe victim testified that she could feel Loh molesting her but told herself that the contact was probably accidental or that he was being clumsy.\nNevertheless, she felt confused and uncomfortable and later told her mother that the coach had massaged her such that she felt uncomfortable.\nMOTHER TOLD HER TO SAY NO\nHer mother told her to say ""no"", but the girl was concerned that her coach ""would insist"".\nAt the third training session, the coach met the victim\'s father and nothing untoward occurred.\nHowever, he molested her again at the last training session.\xa0\nLoh had asked the victim if she wanted a massage and she said ""no"".\nIn response, he said ""just massage"" and ""cool down massage"", the victim testified. She tried to decline, but said Loh persisted. She relented as she felt she had to comply given that\xa0he was her coach.\nHe took her to the equipment room and made her lie down before massaging her legs and molesting her.\xa0She told him to stop, but he said ""just relax"".\nAfter this, Loh asked her to go for a meal and they did. Thereafter, she went only for group trainings.\nEVIDENCE CONSIDERED AT TRIAL\nThe judge considered evidence including a chain of messages between the victim and a female training partner known only as Ms W, who also made complaints of molest against Loh.\nThe victim in this case also texted a friend and junior college senior, saying: ""I think Mr Loh molested me, idk.""\nSometime in 2013, she told another coach, Ms Michelle Eng, about feeling uncomfortable with Loh due to the massages, but did not give more details.\nIt was only three years later in 2016 that she texted Ms Eng to give her a full account. She wrote that Loh made her train individually with him and kept massaging her further up her thighs.\n""I think I just spent (really) long crying and feeling very dirty but when I tried to explain to you that time I didn\'t dare say it,"" she said.\xa0\n""I told Ms W what had happened and she told me he did the same to me to when she continued training ... but she just tried to forget about it. That\'s why I kinda stopped running and she stopped training under him. I\'m scared you\'ll send the juniors to train under him when they graduate so just letting you know.""\nThe victim stressed that her primary concern in raising the matter was not personal vindication but the concern that juniors from her alma mater might train under Loh.\nThe defence sought to cast doubt on the credibility of the victim\'s evidence, focusing on her apparent inability to recall specific details of the venue such as the colour of the stadium walls, but Judge Bay noted that she was trying to recall in 2018 what had happened several years ago in 2013.\nHe also noted the supporting text messages and the evidence by the victim\'s father, who corroborated her account of being present at one of the training sessions where he did not see any other trainees.\n\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bSINGAPORE ATHLETICS RESPONDS\nA spokesman for Singapore Athletics told CNA that Loh was vice-president of the group when he was first charged in court, but voluntarily suspended himself from duties.\nSingapore Athletics president Tang Weng Fei said Loh has “contributed significantly over the years as an athlete, coach and administrator”.\nIn a statement on Wednesday, the sports body highlighted the setting up of SafeSport in 2018, a new commission to tackle sexual abuse in the local sports fraternity.\nSingapore Athletics said the measures put in place included the appointing of an officer to investigate complaints, the establishing of a code of conduct and educating the fraternity on what constitutes acceptable behaviour and where to report incidents.\nLoh will return to court for sentencing on Jun 26. He faces up to two years in jail, or a fine, or both per charge. He cannot be caned as he is above 50.\n', 'related_topics': ['     crime ', '     sports ']}"

      Commentary: As the EPL kicks off, be prepared for a very different second half
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The\xa02019-2020 English Premier League (EPL)\xa0season was suspended on Mar 13\xa0due to the\xa0spread\xa0of the coronavirus.\nSince then there have been over\xa040,000 official deaths in the United Kingdom\xa0but there has been a desire among authorities, both football and political, for the sport to restart.\xa0\nIt will do just that in the early\xa0hours of Jun 18, Singapore time.\nA gap of three months in the English Premier League would usually signify that one season had ended in May and another was starting in\xa0August\xa0but not this time.\xa0\nAston Villa which lost 4-0 at Leicester City on Mar 9 in the last game, before the season was brought to a halt by COVID-19, host Sheffield United\xa0on Thurs (Jun 18) morning\xa0in the first game after the restart.\nABSENCE OF FANS\nThe differences between Villa\'s 28th and 29th game of the season are significant.\nThe most obvious will be the\xa0absence of fans in the stadium.\xa0All the games will take place behind closed doors as ardent fans will have to settle for live telecasts on various broadcasters:\xa0Sky Sports, BT Sports, Amazon and the BBC.\nAll four\xa0broadcasters are\xa0aiming to make the viewing experience as engaging\xa0as possible.\xa0\nSky Sports, which has broadcast Premier League games since the league started in 1992\xa0and will show 64 of the 92 remaining matches,\xa0has teamed up with EA Sports FIFA, the makers of the popular FIFA video game franchise to create “a range of bespoke and team-specific crowd noises and chants to bring the vibrant atmosphere” of the EPL to television, Sky said on its website on Jun 8 adding that viewers can choose to turn off the effects.\nBT Sports have looked to Germany\xa0where football restarted in mid-May.\xa0“Having watched the Bundesliga we are all acutely aware it’s not quite the product it was previously,” said Simon Green, the head of BT Sport.\xa0\n“But the emotional interest and attachment people have to football in this country is such that it will still be a very strong television product. Without crowds it does open up opportunities to use innovation to enhance coverage.”\nClubs are doing their bit too. Aston Villa have asked fans to send in short videos of themselves cheering on their team. This content is set to be shown on the pitch-side advertising hoardings during the game.\nWhatever enhancements are made, the best way to keep viewers entertained is for the players to serve up the kind of exciting and fast-paced games that helped make the EPL the most popular in the world.\xa0\nARE THE PLAYERS READY?\nThis may not be easy.\xa0Ahead of the start of a normal season, clubs have pre-season training in mid-June\xa0before embarking on foreign tours in July. They then return home for\xa0the final tune-ups before the season begins in August, giving them six to seven weeks to prepare.\xa0\nNow, the time frame to get ready for “Project Restart” has been much tighter.\nEPL teams\xa0only agreed to return to full\xa0contact training on May 27, just three weeks before the games.\nTable toppers Liverpool, 25 points clear at the top and virtually certain of winning a first league title since 1990, played a first full friendly only on Jun 11 – only 10 days before they relaunch their title bid.\nThere are concerns that players may not be physically ready for the stresses of competitive football especially since the outbreak of the pandemic in the UK meant that players were mostly indoors.\n“All the players in England are at risk, because three major aspects are against them,”\xa0said Raymond Verheijen, a well-known physical conditioning coach.\n""Physically and anatomically they are well below par when it comes to fitness.\xa0The brain and the body are now coming out of a totally different period.”\xa0\n“Players have had a resting period of four weeks at least where they could not train as a group.\xa0We are now going back to a full league program with just two weeks of group training maximum and zero friendly games as preparation.\xa0It is not difficult to work out that this is by far and away insufficient.”\nThe Bundesliga experience backs up the Dutchman’s warnings.\xa0After the first four round of games in\xa0Germany, injuries were up 225 per cent compared to\xa0the\xa0usual\xa0start of a season.\nBayer Leverkusen boss Peter Bosz revealed the extent of the problem.\xa0“My players never complain about muscle pain after training sessions. Suddenly they do,”\xa0Bosz said.\n“And do you want to know how many players are doubtful for the next match every week? Almost all 11! Seriously.’’\nIt will help that teams will be able to name nine instead of the usual seven substitutes on the bench for the rest of the season and introduce five instead of three of those during the game.\nThis temporary measure was put in place to help each team cope with playing nine or 10 games from the middle of June to the end of July in a rush to finish a season that should have ended in May.\nWith injuries and possible worries of catching the virus, it remains to be seen if the action is as fast-paced and aggressive as usual. The absence of the atmosphere created by fans could also affect the energy of the players.\nNO MORE HOME ADVANTAGE\nIt also seems to have another effect. Since the Bundesliga restarted, there has been a striking dilution of home advantage.\xa0\nIn Germany, home teams have won just 10 of 46 games since the return with that 21.7 per cent rate at about half of the 43.3 per cent recorded before the suspension.\nSimilar trends have been reported in Estonia and the Czech Republic.\n“Football is about passion and energy and when you lose that, it is balanced much more,” said Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta who faces a tough trip to champions Manchester City in his club’s first game this week.\n“It better be right that playing away is an advantage because we are away four times in a row.”\nOnly two things can be said with a greater degree of certainty.\nLiverpool will eventually be crowned champions and the league will look and feel very different. Just how different will be seen in the coming days and weeks.\nYet, any form of football is welcomed by the die-hard fans among us.\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\nJohn Duerden has lived in Asia for 20 years and covers the region’s sporting scene.

      Football: Six battle to beat drop in eerie relegation scrap
  </h1>, 'text': 'LONDON:\xa0This season\'s Premier League survival scrap will not feature TV cutaways of fans chewing fingernails, checking scores on their phones or, when all hope has gone, bursting into tears.\nThis time the annual ""beat the drop"" contest will be played out in eerie silence in empty stadiums while fans squirm on the sofa at home. It will add a sense of the surreal to what promises to be an absorbing spectacle.\nAfter Aston Villa\'s 0-0 draw with Sheffield United on Wednesday, the six clubs mired in the battle have nine games left in five frantic weeks to preserve their top-flight status.\nWhen the season stopped three months ago bottom club Norwich City were six points behind 17th-placed Watford and according to manager Daniel Farke requiring a ""little miracle"".\nNorwich have shown enough to suggest an escape route might still be possible and a win against Southampton on Friday would raise hope in East Anglia, especially with games against fellow strugglers Brighton, Watford and West Ham United still to come.\nSecond-from-bottom Villa are five points better off but Dean Smith\'s side were in a wretched run of form before the lockdown.\nTherefore Wednesday\'s point, and a rare clean sheet for a side that has conceded 56 goals, was something to cling to.\nThey even had an enormous slice of luck when keeper Orjan Nyland carried the ball over his own goalline but a technology glitch meant he got away with it. An omen perhaps?\nThird-from-bottom Bournemouth have punched above their weight since reaching the top flight in 2016, but Eddie Howe\'s side fell away badly in mid-season and their cause will not be helped by winger Ryan Fraser opting not to extend his contract beyond June 30 to complete the season.\nWatford, one place above the drop zone, looked doomed before Nigel Pearson took charge in December, with one victory all season. He inspired a stunning turnaround in form though and shortly before the coronavirus pandemic struck they ended Liverpool\'s hopes of an unbeaten season with a magical 3-0 win.\nMatches against Southampton, Norwich, Newcastle United and West Ham should offer enough points for Watford to stay safe.\nWest Ham vice-chairman Karen Brady caused a stir early in the lockdown, saying the season should be declared ""null and void"" -\xa0perhaps understandable considering West Ham\'s plight.\nThree defeats in their four games before the pause left the Hammers, like Watford, out of the bottom three on goal difference only. Their fate could be decided in their last four games when they face Norwich, Watford and Villa.\nBrighton are two points better off in 15th but face a formidable schedule with Arsenal, Leicester City, Manchester United, Liverpool and Manchester City still to play.\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     sports ', '     Watford ', '     football ']}"

      Commentary: Liverpool's victory in time of pandemic is both agony and ecstasy
  </h1>, 'text': 'LEICESTER, England: What were you doing 30 years ago? Were you even born?\nLet me mark your card here. Research at CERN in Switzerland by British computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 to 1990 would eventually result in the World Wide Web, linking hypertext documents into an information system accessible from any node on the network.\nIn other words, the Internet was just being conceived.\nThere was no social media back then, little reality TV. Mobile phones – when you knew someone who had one – were like bricks.\nElton John was top of the charts – can’t remember what with, but it was probably on a compact disc.\nTry describing this cultural and information wasteland to anyone under 30 today. It sounds like an era of steam engines, sticky-backed plastic, string and cardboard.\nAnd it was the last time my team, Liverpool FC, were league champions in England. When you grow up with your football team winning, 30 years is a lifetime.\n\n\nSo it was a bit bizarre, watching two clubs, Manchester City and Chelsea – neither of which I’d ever want to win anything, knowing that if Chelsea could stop City winning, Liverpool would secure the greatest prize in English football, for the first time in 30 years.\nAnd when, 13 minutes from the end, with the scores level – still enough for Liverpool to take the title – Chelsea scored a penalty to go 2-1 up against ten men, I knew it was finally heading to Anfield.\nThere was nobody in the stadium to burst into rapturous applause, but hearts were racing across Merseyside, and around the world among followers of Liverpool FC.\n\n\nA LONG WAIT\nBack in the summer of 1990, I bagged a gig for The Times to write a piece about fans at the European Cup final in Vienna: AC Milan 1, Benfica 0.\nEveryone was perfectly behaved and I remember composing some stupid remark home about these wonderful people and how little street theft and disorder there was in places abroad such as Milan.\nUntil, of course, I actually visited Milan.\nBack then, this was about the only way that English fans could connect to elite continental football. We were still banned as a country from European club football because of the Heysel Stadium disaster in 1985 where 39 people died and 600 were injured as some of my club’s fans disgraced themselves and the nation in Brussels.\nPlenty of people back home had had about enough of dismal stadia and the brutality of English fan culture.\n\n\nThe shame of Heysel, weirdly, seemed only to spur Liverpool FC to new heights on the pitch, confirm the club’s domestic power and its importance for local people. We even won the domestic double in 1986, almost did it again in 1988, and almost did it again in 1989.\nFamously, losing the title to Arsenal in 1989 in dramatic, last gasp, fashion came only weeks after the shock of the Hillsborough disaster. We were still in turmoil.\nI sat on the steps of the Kop that night as Arsenal celebrated, thinking that Liverpool winning the league title again wouldn’t have felt right with so many dead fans to grieve for. I wasn’t heartbroken at defeat.\n\n\nOne more league title did come, in 1990, but by then our charismatic managers and the great Liverpool players of this era – Kenny Dalglish was still manager, but his glory days were behind him.\nAnd so many others – a stellar roll call – Souness, Hansen, Rush, even John Barnes, were gone, past their best or retired. Their replacements were often sub-standard.\nIt was the end of a glorious road, 25 years of fantastic success.\n\n\nWILDERNESS YEARS\nLiverpool FC would now lose traction, fall behind their key rivals. This was mainly because the club was still run as a superior corner shop, reluctant to embrace change – club secretary Peter Robinson even opposed new computer software for the finance staff.\nBut it was also because the longer-term baggage of these awful disasters of the 1980s engulfed the club, its staff and its supporters.\nThe old Anfield boot room aura of competitive coaching advantage would now no longer work in this new, more global, age of sports science, international player recruitment, and billionaire foreign owners. Buying the best of British was no guarantee of success, as it once had been for Liverpool in the 1970s and 1980s.\nThe aftermath of Hillsborough also produced an agenda for nationwide stadium modernisation, a moment when the game itself in England was completely reconstructed and repackaged.\nThis came with the birth of the brassy new, commodified FA Premier League in 1992, the rise of satellite TV as a major new funder for English football, and the globalisation of the elite levels of the English game, made possible by new technology and new marketing and communication techniques.\nLiverpool FC took time to reconnect, still stuck in their old ways.\n\n\nKLOPP RULES THE KOP\nIt has taken 30 years for us to get back to the very top – the occasional wonderful European triumph and other domestic trophies notwithstanding.\nWe almost went under completely in 2010, rescued by our current owners, the Americans at FSG, only at the 11th hour in the High Court.\nIn 2014, a cruel Steven Gerrard slip robbed us, at the last, of a certain title. There were tears on the Kop.\n\n\nA year later, and a hippy-looking, bearded smoker breezed in from Germany, apparently drunk on Kool-Aid, to tell us that Bill Shankly himself had been resurrected with a dentist’s smile, and that he was going to build a new fortress at Anfield.\nThis new coach was soon even scolding his own supporters in the Liverpool Main Stand for leaving matches too early. Who was this guy?\nJurgen Klopp has somehow whizzed Liverpool football club back to the 1960s, when the city was iridescent and its ambitious young Scottish manager and his players believed anything was achievable – and then went on to show how.\n\n\nThe “heavy metal” global team Klopp has built in five years, with its Dutchmen, Brazilians, Africans and Brits, is the best I have seen at Anfield – and I have pretty much seen them all. It may even be the best ever to play at the highest level in the English game. It is close to perfect.\nWhich is why it is both agony and ecstasy now, watching Liverpool, my club, claim this first title for 30 long years, not from my Block 207, Row 15, Seat 60 place on the Kop, but from the unwelcome comfort of my living room. Nobody is even sitting in the stadium where I should be.\nAt least the season has not been voided as some scared accountants and club chief executives initially wanted. And not even Pep Guardiola’s brilliant Manchester City could stop us.\nBut COVID-19 has meant our own, long-awaited, 19th league title will have to be consumed and celebrated home and alone. It is hard to take – I do want to get out and scream – but after 30 years, and in the current circumstances, I can live with that.\nJohn Williams is Senior Lecturer in Sociology, University of Leicester.

      Commentary: Pulling off 2021 Olympics is a win Japan needs
  </h1>, 'text': 'LONDON: Japan’s path to hosting the Summer Olympics has had more than its fair share of twists and turns.\nThe Tokyo 1940 Olympics were cancelled. Since their inception in 1896, the Olympics have been cancelled only three times: 1916, 1940 and 1944, all in wartime.\nThe Games have weathered political boycotts and acts of terrorism, but in 2020 they have been postponed for the first time because of a pandemic.\nTokyo’s first staging of the Olympics in 1964 was historic as the first Summer Olympics in Asia, and served to herald Japan’s arrival back on the post-war international stage as a peaceful and technologically modern nation. Tokyo 1964 would come to be known as the “Happy Olympics”.\nAttempts to brand Tokyo 2020 as the “Recovery Olympics” after the 2011 triple disaster received mixed responses. Still, Japan’s strategy to host sport mega-events remains anchored in encouraging investment in “new” sectors such as tourism, travel, sport, education, healthcare and retirement.\nIf Tokyo can pull off a successful Olympics in 2021 despite the pandemic, it really could go down in history as the “Recovery Olympics”. But this hinges upon Japan’s political decision-making in response to COVID-19 amid global management of the virus.\nPOSTPONING THE OLYMPICS\nJapan’s political decision-makers were widely criticised for their slow response to the pandemic and were accused of prioritising hosting Tokyo 2020 over public health. On Mar 24, the postponement of Tokyo 2020 was announced\xa0by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the Tokyo 2020 Organising Committee.\nThis occurred amid growing media speculation about the extent of Japan’s resistance to postponement, who could claim credit for the final decision, and to what extent statements from athletes, sports federations and other national Olympic committees had driven the decision.\nThis speculation highlighted the complexity of the arrangements between multiple stakeholders critical to staging the Olympics. The IOC was primarily guided by information from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the need to coordinate with Japan as the host nation.\nAfter seven years of working with the 2020 hosts across the interplay of national, municipal and sporting institutions to plan the Games, any decision on the future of 2020 had to be made jointly by the IOC and Japan.\nUNCERTAIN FUTURE AHEAD\nWith the world facing over 9.4\xa0million cases of COVID-19 and 480,000 deaths (as of Jun 25), the decision to postpone the Games was apposite.\nStill, the implications of the postponement for both the Olympics as an event and the city of Tokyo are uncertain.\nThe delivery of the 2021 Games is now overseen by an IOC-Tokyo 2020 Joint Steering Committee, each with their own task force: The “Here we go” Task Force on the IOC side and the “New Launch” Task Force on the Tokyo 2020 side.\nTokyo 2020 was expected to host some 11,000 athletes in 339 events across 33 different sports from 206 competing nations.\nThere was expected to be some 7,000 officials, 25,000 media representatives, 80,000 volunteers and 900,000 daily spectators, with an estimated 10 million visitors expected to travel to Japan.\nThe Japanese public had already purchased almost 4.5 million of the 7.8 million total tickets. There are 43 domestic sporting venues and hundreds of thousands of travel and accommodation bookings to rearrange.\nJapanese stakeholders have already spent between US$12.6 billion and US$25.2 billion on Tokyo 2020.\nGlobal broadcast rights for the Olympics total billions of dollars and constitute three-quarters of the IOC’s income. NBC pays US$1.4 billion for the US broadcast alone.\nPostponement is estimated to cost an additional US$2.7 billion to US$5.8 billion for Japan, while complete cancellation is estimated at a loss of US$41.5 billion.\nJapan’s inbound tourism has increased significantly in recent years. In 2019, visitors to Japan from China alone numbered nine million. The impact of COVID-19 has massive economic implications for Japan beyond Tokyo 2020.\nThe investment in facilities and infrastructure will likely pay off for Tokyo over time, particularly given current decisions on sustainability and the fact that much of the Tokyo 1964 facilities are still in use.\nALL BOILS DOWN TO COVID-19 MANAGEMENT\nThe viability of 2021 depends on Japan’s ability to control COVID-19 domestically. The current number of cases and deaths in Japan is comparatively low (about 18,000 cases and 960 deaths), but policymakers must ensure that lingering criticism and any second wave is effectively managed.\nThe viability of 2021 also hinges on how COVID-19 is managed globally, particularly in nations that are “big hitters” at the Olympics. The United States, Great Britain, Russia, France and Italy were in the top 10 medal-winning nations at Rio 2016.\nThey also rank high as nations most impacted by coronavirus-related deaths, with the full impact of COVID-19 yet to be determined.\nA downsized Olympics without the participation of athletes from major competing countries is likely to be unpopular, but Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike has announced that the Japanese government and Tokyo 2020 organising committee are contemplating a simplified Games.\nIf Japan had COVID-19 under control by July 2021, with strict quarantine measures at the border, the Games could run in a viable format, for example, behind closed doors or with reduced spectators.\nLessons learned from Japan’s hosting of the 2019 Rugby World Cup, including its crisis response to the typhoon that struck during the tournament, are still valuable but possibly less valid amid the new challenges of a global pandemic.\nIf Tokyo 2020 is downsized or cancelled, the legacy will be how to manage a “new normal” world for the Olympics and other sport mega-events.\nBeijing 2022 is scheduled to start five months after Tokyo 2020 ends and Paris 2024 two years thereafter, so lessons from Japan will be paramount.\nHelen Macnaughtan is Chair of the Japan Research Centre and Senior Lecturer in International Business and Management at SOAS University of London.

      Human Rights Watch report documents abuse of child athletes in Japanese sport
  </h1>, 'text': 'TOKYO: A Human Rights Watch report has found child athletes in Japan often suffer physical and verbal abuse and sometimes sexual abuse when training for sport after documenting the experiences of over 800 athletes in 50 sports.\nThe 67-page report released on Monday (Jul 20) titled I Was Hit So Many Times I Can\'t Count\xa0looks at Japan\'s history of physical punishment in sport and includes first-hand accounts of athletes being punched, kicked and whipped.\nThe report comes in the week that would have marked the start of the Tokyo Olympics had it not been for the global coronavirus pandemic. The Games have now been delayed a year.\n""For decades, children in Japan have been brutally beaten and verbally abused in the name of winning trophies and medals,"" Minky Worden, director of global initiatives at Human Rights Watch (HRW), said in a statement.\nIn 2013, the Japanese Olympic Committee (JOC) promised to take steps to wipe out violence among its sports federations after an internal survey revealed more than 10 per cent of its athletes had been victims of bullying or harassment.\nThey also cut funding to its judo federation at the time after coaches were found to have physically abused female athletes.\nHRW said, however, that not enough had been done since then and demanded organisations such as the Japan Sports Council and the JOC use the upcoming Olympics as a catalyst for change.\nThe JOC did not immediately respond to Reuters\' requests for comment.\nThe report was based on interviews with more than 50 current and former athletes, an online survey that drew more than 757 responses and meetings with eight Japanese sports organisations.\nOf the 381 survey respondents aged 24 or younger, 19 per cent indicated they had been hit, punched, slapped, kicked, knocked to the ground or beaten with an object while participating in sports. These experiences occurred in at least 22 different sports, the report said.\n""The coach told me I was not serious enough with the running, so we were all called to the coach and I was hit in the face in front of everyone.

      Commentary: Even the Tour de France is going virtual
  </h1>, 'text': 'MANCHESTER, England: Elite sports events are still largely closed to the world.\xa0\nBut July 2020 has still been an unprecedented month for the global sporting calendar thanks to the first Virtual Tour de France, which – despite the name – was based nowhere in particular, as riders took part from their homes in all parts of the world.\nIt’s historic, not just because the event brought together the world of e-sports cycling and the iconic and gruelling race, but also because this was the first time women competed in a multistage Tour.\nThere were some key differences. Rather than being an individual race, it was run in teams, a lot shorter than the actual Tour and, most importantly, involved cyclists sitting on their bikes indoors plugged into the Zwift virtual cycling system.\nYet, for the audiences tuning in via YouTube, it’s easy to mistake it for an actual broadcast of a road race, as the graphics emulate the physical map and terrain of the route. Even the broadcast commentary was similar.\nThe Tour is the latest in a whole range of digital innovations that have brought sports into the homes of millions of people during the COVID-19 lockdown, when they all had to press pause on their physical events programmes.\nYet, the foundation for these experiments were laid in January, when the president of the International Olympic Committee, Thomas Bach, told all International Sports Federations to figure out their e-sports strategy.\nThe urgency is all the more apparent when observing that all those sports sponsors – and broadcasters – are already aligning their brands with e-sports.\nCoca-Cola, Intel and Samsung, among many others, are already highly invested in e-sports. David Beckham’s newly formed Guild Esports announced it will establish a professional e-sports team for the 21st-century version of football, Rocket League, a videogame in which players race cars around an arena driving a ball towards a goal, using the online platform Battlefy.\nVIRTUALLY THE SAME\nCOVID-19 has accelerated the alignment of elite sports industries with e-sports – and even those who previously dismissed e-sports as not being like real sport now have the IOC president to contend with.\nBach noted that platforms like Zwift were absolutely the same as sports, suggesting a future in which virtual sport may be a bigger part of the elite sports scene. It may be no coincidence that the IOC’s Esports Liaison Group is chaired by the president of the International Cyclists Union, David Lappartient.\nSoon after lockdown began, sports were racing to get in on the virtual action.\nAmong the first was Formula One, which was nudged into producing “Not the Australian Grand Prix”, when its Melbourne race was cancelled. Teaming up with Veloce Esports, F1’s first digital event used its official computer game to produce a unique experience, where gamers, F1 drivers and celebrities came together to race the Australian track.\nIn the end, e-sports racer Daniel Bereznay took the chequered flag with former Dutch racing driver-turned-sim racer Jarno Opmeer coming in second.\nIn April, the ATP and WTA organised an e-sports tennis competition instead of the Mutua Madrid Open, using Nacon’s Tennis World Tour video game. Again, some of the world’s biggest names came together to compete. Great Britain’s Andy Murray took the title.\nAlso in April, we saw the virtual Grand National take place for the fourth time. This year was special, as there was no accompanying physical race thanks to COVID-19.\nInstead, racing fans – and gamblers – could tune into YouTube and watch a race of computer-generated horses, all of which had been expected starters for the actual race.\nThe winner was decided in advance of the start gun being fired, based on the rider’s previous form, day conditions, among other factors.\nThis algorithm-driven sport may not feel much like sport for many – but it worked. We can expect to see a significant amount of business generated from gambling opportunities around virtual sports.\nFootball was slow to get back on to the pitch, and many clubs began experimenting with in-stadia innovations. By the time players were back on the field – without spectators – some clubs had set up giant screens inside the stadium giving the impression of thousands of fans.\nClubs also experimented with virtual reality to train players and real-time canned audience sounds became part of a new language of broadcast production.\nThe international basketball federation was next, producing the world’s first international e-sports version of its sport in May using the game NBA 2K. While the game has not previously impressed gamers, it did well to bring new audiences to basketball at a time when no live events were taking place.\nFinally, there has also been a whole lot of e-sports happening during lockdown, occupying the space where many of these aspiring sports brands seek to locate themselves. Gaming has had a very good lockdown indeed – data shows that game sales and use have grown significantly over 2020.\nNEW WAYS TO PLAY\nLockdown brought e-sports further into the mainstream – even the BBC broadcast events on its digital platform.\nWe also saw how the creative and cultural industries are coming together around e-sports titles. Of note were the virtual concerts that took place in Fortnite, particularly the American rapper Travis Scott’s spectacular performance, which could only be seen live if you were logged in as a player within Fortnite, prompting fans to download the title just to see the concert.\nIn the same way that social media platforms such as TikTok and Instagram are establishing new markets and audiences, e-sports and the virtualisation of sport are showing how new economies are emerging around novel experiences through gaming platforms.\nWhile many of the COVID-19 e-sports events from international sports federations have been more showcase events than elite competition, they have paved the way for a new normal to emerge, not just for participants, but for the many industries that produce media events.\nAndy Miah is Chair in Science Communication & Future Media at the University of Salford.

      An Indonesian motorbike racer lost his leg in a crash. Now he is gunning for Paralympic glory
  </h1>, 'text': 'JAKARTA: It was supposed to be a glorious day for Muhammad Fadli Imammuddin.\nThe motorcycle racer, who was then 30 years old, was the first to cross the finish line at the Indonesian leg of the Asia Road Racing\xa0Championship\xa0(ARRC) on Jun 7, 2015.\nHe had been dreaming of winning a race in front of a home crowd for weeks. The win also put him on top of the leaderboard and he had a shot of becoming Indonesia’s first ARRC Supersports 600cc class champion.\nImammuddin was ecstatic. But just as he was celebrating his win and began to wave back at the cheering crowd, another racer rammed him from behind at full speed.\nThe crash was so violent that Imammuddin was hospitalised for the next four months. But the real blow came when doctors told him that his lower left leg was so badly injured it had to be amputated.\n“I was terrified. I worried about my future. My wife was pregnant with my first son. I thought, ‘How am I supposed to provide for my family?’” he told CNA.\nLONG ROAD TO RECOVERY\nImammuddin, now 36, said even after his leg was amputated he was determined to get back on the motorcycle. He had been racing professionally since he was 17. “Motorcycle racing was all I know,” he said. \xa0\xa0\nBut there were times when he doubted himself and thought that his racing days were over. “I was bed-ridden for a very long time. I was in such bad shape I couldn’t sit upright for more than a few minutes,” he said.\nIt was the birth of his son, just a few weeks after his crash, which gave him a much-needed motivation. \xa0\n“I told myself, ‘I have a son now and I have to get back on my feet. I have extra responsibility. I cannot slouch around. I cannot give up,’” he said. “I made a promise to myself that\xa0I had to walk before my son could walk.\xa0It became a competition for me.”\nBut the road to recovery proved to be long and arduous.\n“I set a target for myself. I have to take more steps in every rehabilitation training that I did. In the beginning, just standing up with my new prosthetic leg was laborious and I felt like I was going to pass out. But soon I was taking one step, then two, then three,” he said.\nImammuddin succeeded in his earlier goal of being able to walk before his newborn son could, but it would take him a few more months before he was finally comfortable to get back on his motorcycle.\n“I had my motorbike modified so I could shift gears with my right feet. But I was still out of shape. Before the crash I could do 20 laps non-stop and this time I could barely do five,” he said.\nHe needed a way to get back into shape. “That’s how I started cycling,” Imammuddin said.\nFATE INTERVENED\nImammuddin said a man approached him in late 2016 as he was hanging out at a cafe in the hilly suburbs of Jakarta frequented by professional and amateur cyclists.\nThe man told him: “You know, even able-bodied people would find it hard to cycle in these hills. But you can do it with ease despite your disability.”\xa0\nThe man introduced himself as Raja Sapta Oktohari, a wealthy businessman who would later be the chairman of the Indonesia Asian Para Games Organizing Committee. “He asked if I would be interested in participating in the Para Games,” Imammuddin said.\nThe Para Games would be held in Jakarta in 2018, right after the Asian Games, and Indonesia in 2016 did not have a para-cycling athlete.\n“(Oktohari) said that he needed someone to compete in the para-cycling events and that I would be a good fit,” Imammuddin said.\n“I never dreamed of becoming a professional cyclist. At the time, I only cycled to get myself in shape so I could be a motorcycle racer again.”\nNevertheless, Imammuddin told Oktohari that he was interested. But it would take another chance meeting with Indonesia’s cycling legend Puspita Mustika Adya to seal the deal.\nMustika said in a 2018 interview with Indonesian media Viva News that he was there at the Sentul Circuit when Imammuddin’s accident occurred. “I even shook hands with Fadli (before the race). We all cheered when Fadli won the race but then I saw Fadli being rammed and thrown off his bike,” he said.\nMustika said he had heard about Imammuddin’s amputation from a friend. When he saw a Facebook video of Imammuddin cycling, just over a year after his crash, Mustika said he was shocked and became interested in meeting Imammuddin in person.\nImammuddin recalled the time when Mustika came to his house. “It was not long after I met (Oktohari). (Mustika) said he had seen a video of me cycling and praised me. He also asked if I was interested in becoming a para-cycling athlete,” he said.\nThe words of encouragement from a cycling legend and the confidence that he had shown was what convinced Imammuddin to pursue a different career and become Indonesia’s first para cycling-athlete.\nBIGGER AMBITIONS \xa0\xa0\xa0\nImammuddin and coach Mustika soon got to work and Imammuddin trained with able-bodied cycling professionals.\nIn March 2017, less than three months after they started training, Imammuddin participated in the Asian Road Cycling Championships in Manama, Bahrain. \xa0\nImammuddin finished fourth in the C-4 individual time trial category. C-4 is a para-cycling classification for athletes who can compete with standard bicycles and have\xa0either one leg amputated below the knee or both arms amputated below the elbows.\nIn September that year, Imammuddin got his first taste of the podium as a para-cycling athlete when he won the bronze medal at the 2017 Asean Para Games in Malaysia.\nA year later at the Asian Para Games in Jakarta, he won a gold, a silver and a bronze medal at three different track and road para-cycling events.\nImammuddin is now training for the Paralympics in Tokyo. The games were supposed to be held in August but because of the COVID-19 pandemic they have been pushed back to next year.\xa0\nOn Monday (Aug 3), organisers of the Paralympics said the\xa0opening ceremony will take place on Aug 24 next year, with 539 events to be scheduled\xa0until the closing ceremony on Sep 5.\xa0\xa0\nWhile the postponement has given\xa0Imammuddin more time to prepare, the pandemic also meant that he had to train on his own.\n“I still need to improve my speed and my performance, because my goal is to win a medal at the Paralympics,” he said, adding that he has a target of shaving off 10 seconds from his personal record of four minutes and 52 seconds on a 4,000m track.\n“I must always practise. When the pandemic is over we might see a boom in sporting events. So I have to be ready. Before the Paralympics there would be many single events which are crucial for the qualification process. If I don’t participate I might not qualify (for the Paralympics).”\nImammuddin said since the pandemic began he has been training on his own six times a week. His training regime includes two endurance sessions, one involving a 22km climb up the hills and another a 120km tour of Jakarta. The other four sessions are spent on improving his speed.\n“Even though my coaches still monitor my progress, it is different when you are in a boot camp situation. At a boot camp, you have coaches pushing you, people monitoring your diet, colleagues supporting you and cheering you on.\n“You really focus on training. But if you train on your own, there are sometimes distractions. But I always remind myself of my target. That is what keeps me focused. That is what keeps me excited.”\nImammuddin said he is grateful for what had happened. In 2018, he even went to Thailand to meet the racer responsible for the crash. The two became friends and remained close to this day, Imammuddin said.\n“When I lost my leg I initially thought my career as an athlete was over. I was feeling a bit angry. I was at the peak of my motor racing career. I had all my limbs. But they were taken away from me,” he said.\n“But I have since made peace with my condition and now can even enjoy bigger opportunities. When I was in motor racing I only competed in Asian level. But through cycling I can participate in world events and the ultimate stage, the Paralympics, is within my grasp.”\nDespite his achievements, Imammuddin said he still misses motorcycle racing sometimes. To compensate, Imammuddin started his own racing school in 2016 where he coaches aspiring racers. “So my passion for motorbikes still has an outlet,” he said.\nBut Imammuddin said he does not want to return to his former career as a professional motorcycle racer.\n“Cycling is my life now. Besides, the risks in motor racing are too great. If I crash, not only will I risk injuring myself but also damage my prosthesis,” he said with a smile, pointing to his US$10,000 carbon fibre leg. “They are not cheap.”\n\n', 'related_topics': ['     Indonesia ', '     cycling ', '     sports ']}"

      Commentary: Lewis Hamilton has dominated F1. But the sport has also gained from his success
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Formula One (F1) fans are happy that the season finally started in July after COVID-19 delayed the original start in March.\nSome of that delight may be evaporating however as Lewis Hamilton looks set to dominate once again – unless of course if you are a fan of his. Hamilton has won five of the last six F1 titles.\nHamilton has already won three of the four races this year so far and was placed fourth in the other - though he actually finished second in the Austria Grand Prix only to receive a five-second penalty for contact with another car.\nThat Hamilton is now 33 points clear of Mercedes team mate Valtteri Bottas would not be such a worrying prospect for the other drivers since they could catch up as winning any of the remaining races would be worth 25 points, while attaining second and third place would earn them 16 and 15 points respectively. \xa0\nIn a normal season of 21 races, there would have been more time to catch Hamilton.\nNothing about this year is normal though and the shortened F1 season is no exception as there are only nine races remaining. If Hamilton were to win three more, that could be enough for a fourth straight title.\nAfter the British Grand Prix win on Aug 2, Max Verstappen, the third-placed Dutch rival of Hamilton, told reporters that the British star couldn’t be caught. He also said last November “It’s getting a bit boring seeing Lewis win.”\nSTARS HAVE TO MAKE WAY TOO\nF1 is not the only predictable sport. Top level football offers few surprises as well.\nJuventus have won the last nine Italian titles with Bayern Munich taking the previous eight in Germany. Of the big European competitions, only the English Premier League seems to offer some surprises with five winners in the past eight years but even there, the top six is full of familiar names.\nIn team sports however, the elite clubs can sign new stars and stay at the top for decades. Individual sports are different. The giants of tennis, golf, F1 and others have a limited time span at the top.\n“Lewis Hamilton is in the midst of a fight he cannot win,” reported F1’s official site in March. “This is the generational battle so many great athletes face, the struggle to stay on top against the twin foes of age and the ever-improving rising stars.”\nWhen that fight is over, Hamilton will be missed and not just for his success on the track, but also for taking the sport to unchartered territories off it.\nTake other star athletes such as Serena Williams in tennis and golf’s Tiger Woods. They didn’t just set standards that others have to try to match up to but transcended their sport, taking it to new heights.\nWoods became the youngest ever player to win a major in 1997 and became an instant sensation. He attracted a new audience.\xa0\nIn those Masters tournaments he did not win until 2008, lesser US households, at 7.4 per cent, tuned in to watch over the four days compared to 9.5 per cent for the years he was triumphant.\xa0\nAs Woods started to dominate and attract outside interest, more money came into the sport. When he started on the tour in 1996, 15 players earned US$1 million, by 2007, that number had increased to 99. Lower down the rankings, winnings increased dramatically. The 130th ranked golfer in 2007 earned more than four times his 1996 predecessor.\n“Tiger has been the instigator,” said golfer Phil Mickelson in 2014.\xa0\n“…Because he’s brought increased ratings, increased sponsors, increased interest and we have all benefited…and we’re all appreciative.\xa0That’s why we miss him so much.”\nMORE POPULAR THAN THEIR SPORT\nTennis great Serena Williams, who is still at the top of the women’s game, is another example.\xa0\nA Sports Media Watch study during the 2018 US Open found that when she played, television ratings increased - not just for her game but for all that were played that day as people were cued onto their TV sets waiting for her to make her entry onto the court.\nIn June, United States Tennis Association CEO Mike Dowse was delighted as Williams announced that she will enter this year’s US Open, saying: \xa0""She transcends tennis and is so much bigger than our sport."" Surely organisers recognise that Williams’ presence would increase viewership of the tournament and widen its appeal.\nJust as Williams and Woods, Hamilton’s popularity also transcends his sport. Legendary F1 team Ferrari has 2.6 million followers on Twitter while the official F1 account itself has 4.7 million followers. Both lag behind Hamilton who has 5.8 million followers.\nThe F1 sport has always had the glamour and technical aspects to appeal to motorsports enthusiasts but has been accused of struggling to move to a wider audience, especially in markets not traditionally seen as hotbeds, such as those in much of Asia, Africa and the Americas. \xa0\n""There is a big gap between Formula One and Toyota\'s actual car users,"" Former Toyota team principal Tadashi Yamashina said back in 2010. “F1 remains the pinnacle of auto racing, but its image grew too elitist.”\nLiberty Media bought the sport in 2017 and the US media company seemed to understand that the sport needed to attract new and especially younger fans.\nENHANCING F1’s APPEAL\nHamilton, with a cool, urban image, does just that. “He is far broader than purely a driver in F1,” David Richards, the chairman of Motorsport UK, said earlier this year. “He has opinions about the environment, young people, fashion and music. That is part of the greater appeal of Lewis today.”\nHamilton has increasingly crossed over from sport into social issues, dragging F1 with him. He has been vocal on the issue of racism and in June attended a Black Lives matter protest - that was reported on Formula One’s official site-- and has knelt in support of the movement ahead of races this season.\nAs the new season started in July, Hamilton explained why he had changed his helmet to reflect his support of Black Lives Matter.\n“We currently now have the mic, and people are starting to listen. We’ve got the opportunity to really push that message and really hold people accountable,” he wrote on social media. “Brands and the teams in Formula 1, everybody here needs to be held accountable and be open to educate themselves, be open to understand why the movement is happening, and why around the world we need to keep pushing for equality.”\nHamilton has driven the sport down new roads and avenues.\n""He\'s broadened the sport worldwide to people of colour,” Willy T Ribbs, a retired American racing driver who has likened Hamilton to Muhammad Ali and the boxer\'s fight for equality, told CNN. “He has a right to take a position and take a stand for humanity. That\'s what he\'s doing.”\nAll that is not to say that fans would not appreciate more of a challenge on the track. Hamilton would.\n""This is not the championship fight I would have hoped for,"" he said after his latest victory. ""I\'d much, much prefer to be having a super-close battle… because that\'s what gets me going. I really, really hope that in future it\'s closer.""\nJohn Duerden has lived in Asia for 20 years and covers the region’s sporting scene.

The team that sticks together and the team that’s fit and healthy is going to be on the podium at Tokyo.\n""I just see this as a huge opportunity.""\nAustralia\'s rugby sevens teams were given a boost last month with the national Institute of Sport pledging a one-off grant of AUS$1.4 million (US$997,000) for the women and AUS$800,000 for the men to help them prepare for Tokyo.\nWhile gratefully received, Walsh said the grant would only keep his programme ""breathing"" and he would be banging on boardroom doors to get corporate support for a team that were placed fourth when the World Series was scrapped.\n""Before COVID-19 hit, we hadn’t displayed that kind of form on a World Series with that consistency for close to 10 years,"" said Walsh.\n""So it was a pretty good trajectory we were on. It’s very important that we hold onto that.\n""We’re fighting the good fight and we won’t stop fighting.

      Leipzig's biggest game a reminder of city's glory days
  </h1>, 'text': 'LISBON: When RB Leipzig take the field for their Champions League quarter-final against Atletico Madrid on Wednesday, it will mark a new stage in the rapid rise of a club which was founded only 11 years ago.\nBut despite the newness of the club, backed by energy drink company Red Bull, for football lovers in the Eastern part of Germany and the Saxony region in particular, the occasion will spark some nostalgia as well as a good deal of local pride.\nA regional league club as recently as seven years ago, RB Leipzig were only promoted to the Bundesliga in 2016 and they continue to break new ground with the last 16 win over Tottenham Hotspur, taking them into the \'final eight\' tournament in the Portuguese capital.\n""This is the biggest game in our club\'s history and we will do everything we can to advance another round. The boys are motivated and will give everything,"" said Leipzig\'s sporting director Markus Kroesche.\nCritics of the club, of which there many in Germany, may scoff at the reference to history, given RB Leipzig have very little of it.\nThe criticism of the club is because of the way that Red Bull became an exception to ownership rules in Germany where individuals cannot buy a majority share of a team unless they are the single biggest investors for an uninterrupted 20-year period.\nBut billionaire Red Bull owner Dietrich Mateschitz was able to circumvent that rule when he bought the licence of amateur club SSV Markranstaedt in 2009 and turned them into RasenBallsport Leipzig - literally Lawn Ball Leipzig, a name which allows them to use the company\'s RB initials.\nBut what is often ignored in the well-worn arguments about the soul and spirit of Bundesliga clubs is an acknowledgment that East German football, which went into the doldrums after reunification in 1990, was in desperate need of a club with new resources and ideas.\nEstablished clubs across East Germany, who had been top teams in the old DDR-Oberliga and participants in European competition, quickly ran into financial difficulties, many collapsing into regional league obscurity.\nFIRST GERMAN CHAMPIONS\nLeipzig may have a novel ownership structure for the Bundesliga but the idea of new clubs, with new names is nothing unusual for older East German football, who got used to the communist authorities forced mergers and name-changes frequently throughout the 40-year history of their state.\nLeipzig, as a city, has a long history in football having been the place where the German Football Union (DFB) was founded in 1900 with VfB Sportbrueder 1893 Leipzig one of the first 86 member clubs.\nUnder the shorter name VfB Leipzig, they became the first German champions in 1903, winning the title again three years later and once more in 1913 and they won the German Cup in 1936.\nAfter post-war refoundation and mergers, two Leipzig clubs emerged in the 1960\'s - 1. FC Lokomotive and BSG Chemie Leipzig.\nWhile Chemie enjoyed some domestic success, Locomotive were the team that made more of a mark on the international stage, enjoying a run to the final of the now discontinued Cup Winners\' Cup in 1987, where they lost to Ajax - a Marco van Basten goal ending the dream for the East Germans in Athens.\nThen, as will be the case on Wednesday, Leipzig fans missed out on attending their big night. Whereas COVID-19 restrictions mean the Atletico match will be played behind closed doors this week, in 1987 East Germans were simply barred from travel to the West by the communist authorities.\nThe big night for Leipzig fans in that year came in the semi-final where the formidable Bordeaux team, including the great Jean Tigana, were eliminated on penalties in front of 67,000 at the old Zentralstadion.\nThere is no lineage between Lokomotive and RB Leipzig and indeed \'Lok\' still exist, playing regional league football in front of small crowds of loyalists.\nTheir Zentralstadion was for many years a symbol of the decline of East German football, under-used with no top team to attract fans.\nBut it is now Red Bull Park, home to the club which on Wednesday will be hoping to write a new chapter in the story of Leipzig\'s football.\n(Reporting by Simon Evans, editing by Pritha Sarkar)\n', 'related_topics': ['     sports ', '     Leipzig ', '     Germany ']}"

      Diamond League back with a bang in Monaco
  </h1>, 'text': 'LONDON: After a frustrating summer of cancellations, exhibitions and virtual competitions, athletics is finally able to reveal its shop window as the Diamond League swings into belated action with a star-studded field in Monaco on Friday.\nThe sport should have been taking centre stage in the glow of the Tokyo Olympics this week but that highlight has long been wiped from the 2020 calendar, along with a host of Diamond League events.\nSo it is no exaggeration to describe Friday\'s Meeting Herculis as ""eagerly awaited"" and topping a high-class bill in the Principality is Noah Lyles in the 200 metres.\nThe American faces some quality competition in the shape of Ramil Guliyev and Christophe Lemaitre, while one rival might not be so well known to the wider athletics public but is extremely familiar to Lyles - his younger brother Josephus.\nJosephus is primarily a 400m man and has not raced his big brother in an official race for more than three years.\nBeatrice Chepkoech, who broke the women\'s 3000m steeplechase world record at Monaco in 2018, and Sifan Hassan, who did the same over a mile last year, face off over 5,000m in a race also featuring world champion Hellen Obiri.\nPole vaulter Mondo Duplantis is another world record holder on duty and, after enjoying a successful summer of somewhat leftfield exhibitions, faces more traditional competition from reigning world and Diamond League champion Sam Kendricks.\nThere are two high-quality 1500m races on the programme. In the women\'s event Uganda\'s 800m world champion Halimah Nakaayi is up against Olympic champion Faith Kipyegon and Briton Laura Muir.\nIn the men\'s race, world champion Timothy Cheruiyot gets reacquainted with Norway\'s Ingebrigtsen brothers.\nWorld champion Karsten Warholm is on duty in the men\'s 400m hurdles, while Ivorian Marie-Josee Ta Lou will start favourite in the women\'s 100m.\nAhead of the event, the sport\'s governing body World Athletics, has issued a reminder about the recently-introduced ""Rule 5"", which puts a sole height limit of 25mm on all shoes worn in track events of 800m and above in distance.\nThe rule does not prevent a road running shoe from being worn on the track but a 30mm or 40mm road running shoe cannot be worn for track events because of the 25mm limit. The rule was introduced after concerns that shoes such as Nike\'s Alphafly were giving athletes an unfair technical advantage.\nShoes, of course, will not be the only things undergoing tests, as all athletes will be COVID-19 tested as part of the strict guidelines that have allowed the event to be held with competitors travelling in from around the world.\n""We have changed everything, from the athletes’ travel and accommodation logistics to the way the competition will be staged and conducted,"" said meeting director Jean-Pierre Schoebel.\n""We studied everything to ensure we\'d provide the maximum security to everyone involved in the meeting. We\'ve never worked as hard as this year. I can\'t tell you how difficult the situation has been.""\nKenya\'s Conseslus Kipruto, the Olympic and world 3000m steeplechase champion, had been due to run in Monaco until he tested positive for the coronavirus without symptoms earlier this week.\n(Reporting by Mitch Phillips, editing by Pritha Sarkar)\n', 'related_topics': ['     sports ']}"

  </h1>, 'text': 'WELLINGTON: Violet Walrond overcame massive hurdles to become New Zealand\'s first female Olympian at the 1920 Olympics, but never really understood the significance of what she had done until late in her life, her nephew said.\nThe 15-year-old schoolgirl swimmer was the youngest of the 65 female athletes at the Antwerp Games, the first time New Zealand had its own team at the Olympics after being part of an Australasia team in 1908 and 1912.\nThe New Zealand team, made up of Walrond and three men, took nine weeks to get to Belgium, travelling by boat with stops in Australia and South Africa.\nThe stopovers were the only chance Violet had to train in a pool, although the ship\'s captain tried to help her out with a makeshift facility.\n""The captain did try to make a pool out of tarpaulins and put water into it, but there was no way they could get it deep enough for her to swim in it,"" her nephew John Walrond told Reuters in a telephone interview.\n""And the rocking of the boat just made the water spill out over the sides anyway.""\nThey arrived just days before the Games began and Violet had few opportunities for training before she had to compete in the Olympic \'pool\' - a fenced off section of canal that had been part of Belgium\'s defences in World War One.\nThe pool had no lane markings and the murky, chilly waters did not make for a perfect swimming environment but she made the final of the 100 metres freestyle, finishing fifth behind American Ethelda Bleibtrey.\nShe also reached the final of the other women\'s individual event, the 300m freestyle, but obviously could not compete in the 4x100 relay.\n\'JUST A BIG RACE\'\nWalrond said that while the teenage Violet did not really have any idea of what the Olympics were about - ""she thought it was just a big race"" - she was disappointed that her sister Edna had not made it to Antwerp as well.\n""Edna was a champion diver (but) she couldn\'t go to the Olympics because there wasn\'t a diving board high enough in Auckland for her to practice on and make her competitive,"" Walrond said.\n""Violet said when she watched them diving (in Antwerp), she felt that Edna was much better and would have won the gold for sure.""\nWalrond continued to swim competitively after Antwerp and was keen to go to Paris in 1924, but her father Cecil, who had been her chaperone and New Zealand\'s unofficial coach in 1920, decided that both she and Edna should stop competing.\nViolet said later in life that her father felt they were getting too much publicity.\n""Back in those days, you did what your father told you to do,"" said Walrond, whose father was Violet\'s brother.\nViolet went on to raise a family in Auckland and only became aware of her impact as New Zealand\'s first female Olympian shortly before she died at the age of 91, Walrond said.\n""She (was) surprised by all the attention,"" he said.

  </h1>, 'text': 'WELLINGTON: When New Zealand Olympic chief Mike Stanley was looking at photographs of the first team to represent the nation at a Games ahead of Friday\'s centenary, the one thing that stood out for him was the silver fern badges on their kit.\nThese days, New Zealand\'s Olympians wear pristine custom uniforms with the silver fern that has endured for more than a century as the nation\'s sporting symbol artfully positioned over the left breast.\nIt was very different for the rough and ready pioneers of 1920.\n""They are all so very different. Some (of the ferns) are standing up, some are sideways,"" the New Zealand Olympic Committee President Stanley (NZOC) told Reuters with a laugh.\n""I think it\'s delightful that there seemed to be an attitude of, \'Here we are team. Off we go, here\'s your fern, here\'s your singlet\' ... and they probably had to sew them on themselves.\n""It\'s that sort of pioneering, can do attitude that that team epitomised and it still resonates today too.""\nAthletes from New Zealand had competed as part of the Australasian team in 1908 and 1912 but the opening ceremony of the Antwerp Olympics was the first time they marched under the New Zealand flag.\nThe split from fellow British Dominion Australia was sparked by the First World War, sports author and historian Ron Palenski said.\n""New Zealand had made an independent name for itself,"" he told Reuters. ""People were probably thinking, \'we don\'t need Australia any more, we can stand on our own two feet.\'\n""There was no animosity, I think it was just an assertion of particular national interest.""\nLIONS ON MAIN STREET?\nWith the war and Spanish influenza pandemic ending just a couple of years earlier, the NZOC had six months to select a team and get to Belgium and struggled to raise the necessary funds.\nOne fundraising idea, suggested by the father of teenage swimmer Violet Walrond, was to borrow some lions from a travelling circus and parade them down the main street in Auckland asking for donations, Palenski said.\nThe local council denied them permission, however, and it was not until a week before their boat was due to depart that the funds were finally secured.\nThe team of hurdler Harry Wilson, sprinter George Davidson, rower Darcy Hadfield and swimmer Walrond - the country\'s first female Olympian - took nine weeks to get to Belgium and arrived two days before the Games opened.\nNew Zealand takes around 200 athletes to the Olympics these days.\nAlthough small in number, the 1920 team distinguished themselves well in competition.\nHadfield won bronze in the single sculls - the first of New Zealand\'s 120 Olympic medals - and each of the four made at least one final.\nAbove all, though, they established a legacy for the hundreds of Olympians that have since followed, Stanley said.\n""The fact that they competed in our own colours of black with the iconic silver fern (is their legacy),"" Stanley said.\n""It just talks to New Zealand\'s attitude of being a small nation in a very far flung corner of the world being prepared to take on the rest of the world in sport.\n""It has been an incredible century of achievement by New Zealand athletes.""\n(Editing by Nick Mulvenney and Peter Rutherford)\n', 'related_topics': ['     New Zealand ', '     sports ', '     pioneer ']}"

      Football: Atalanta target for next season? Avoid relegation
  </h1>, 'text': 'MILAN: After their remarkable run in the Champions League and record-equalling third-place finish in Serie A, Atalanta have already set their main target for next season: avoid relegation.\nThe provincial club\'s 2019-20 Champions League run ended in heart-breaking fashion on Wednesday as they conceded two very late goals to lose 2-1 to Paris St Germain, a club with vastly superior spending power, in their quarter-final in Lisbon.\nBut many would like to see free-scoring Atalanta go even further next season and provide more moment such as their 8-4 last 16 aggregate win over Valencia.\nHowever, the financial realities of modern football make it difficult for the likes of Atalanta to compete regularly with the big clubs as their president Antonio Percassi made clear when asked if they could target the Serie A title next season.\n""Let\'s think first about saving ourselves,"" he said. ""Anything more than that is fantastic. We suffered for years, and our goal is to stay in Serie A. That\'s the reality, it\'s always been like that.""\nFor Europe\'s biggest clubs, the end of the season and the following transfer window is a time for cherry-picking the most talented players from smaller rivals by making financial offers that neither the player nor the club can refuse.\nBy the same logic, the challenge for middle-ranking teams such as Atalanta is to avoid having their best players, and their coach, snatched away, leaving them having to rebuild from scratch.\nSo far Atalanta have managed to avoid that fate. Having been relegated three times between 2003 and 2011, Atalanta have enjoyed a vast improvement following the arrival of coach Gian Piero Gasperini in 2016.\nThe 62-year-old led them to fourth place in his first season and despite seeing Andrea Conti and Franck Kessie leave for AC Milan, they rebuilt and finished seventh in 2017-18, also reaching the Coppa Italia semi-finals.\nThat was followed by successive third places in 2018-19 and then again this term, which also featured their debut in the Champions League. But it always feels as if the Sword of Damocles is hanging over them.\n""Several players will be targeted, not just Duvan Zapata,"" said Percassi, referring to the Colombia striker. ""We will do everything we can to keep them, unless the sums involved are impossible to refuse.""\n""Our progress has not been a fluke, it has been a constant growth and we intend to keep that process going,"" he added.\n""Football is a meritocracy. We see a lot of small-medium clubs in Italy working in this direction, and we hope that there can be more following our journey.""\n', 'related_topics': ['     Champions League ', '     football ', '     sports ', '     Atalanta ']}"

  </h1>, 'text': ""\nLISBON:\xa0RB Leipzig stunned Atletico Madrid, with a 2-1 victory in their Champions League quarter-final on Thursday (Aug 13), to reach the competition's last four for the first time in their club's short history.\nWith two minutes of normal time remaining, United States midfielder Tyler Adams snatched victory with a deflected shot from outside the box to set up a semi-final clash with Paris St Germain.\nThe German side had taken the lead in the 51st minute with a header from Spanish forward Dani Olmo but a disjointed Atletico were shaken into life when record signing Joao Felix came off the bench, earning and scoring a penalty to level in the 71st.\nAtletico, runners-up in 2014 and 2016, looked more likely to score the next goal but it was the club founded only eleven years ago who were left celebrating in front of the empty seats of the Estadio Jose Alvalade.\nNow the team, built up from the lower leagues and owned by energy drinks company Red Bull, will come up against Neymar and company with a chance at a place in the Aug. 23 final.\nAs with all games in this 'final eight' mini-tournament, there were no fans to witness the drama but it was clear from the outset that Leipzig felt at home among European football's elite.\nThey fired an early warning shot when Marcel Halstenberg was picked out at the back post but his difficult volley flew off target.\nAtletico responded with Yannick Carrasco bursting in from the left and firing goalwards but Leipzig keeper Peter Gulacsi reacted well to push the effort wide.\nJulian Nagelsmann's side quickly settled though into the brand of attractive passing and movement that has earned them many admirers.\nKevin Kampl was busy in the centre of midfield and left wing back Angelino was enjoying plenty of space down the flanks but it was the performance of French central defender Dayot Upamecano that was the most impressive.\nSolid defensively, taking care of Atletico's over-isolated striker Diego Costa, he also had the confidence to bring the ball out of the back and be the starting point for Leipzig's moves.\nBREAKTHROUGH\nIt was impossible not to wonder how different the game might have been if Leipzig had not sold their top scorer Timo Werner to Chelsea in June, given the lack of a real threat in attack.\nBut six minutes after the interval, they found a way through - Marcel Sabitzer's cross from the right was met by Olmo, the Spaniard's angled header flashing past Jan Oblak and into the far, bottom corner.\nThe goal prompted Atletico boss Diego Simeone into a change, with Felix, the 20-year-old Portugal international and club record signing, introduced in the 58th minute.\nThe move paid off when Felix glided into the box and was brought down by an ill-timed tackle from Lukas Klostermann for a penalty.\nFelix hasn't had the most impactful of debut seasons but he had the confidence to get to his feet and bury the spot kick to get the Spaniards back on level terms with 19 minutes left.\nAtletico sensed the momentum had shifted and they pushed forward in search of a winner, which looked the more likely outcome, possibly in extra-time, as Leipzig struggled to regain control of the game.\nBut with two minutes of normal time remaining, substitute Adams tried his luck with shot from outside the box, which deflected off defender Stefan Savic and beat the wrong-footed Oblak.\nAtletico piled on the pressure but Leipzig had the belief and the fortitude to hold on for their most famous victory.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     football ', '     Champions League ', '     sports ', '     Leipzig ', '     Atletico ']}"

      A nation still potty for snooker's enduring appeal
  </h1>, 'text': 'REUTERS: Park a snooker table inside Sheffield\'s Crucible Theatre and weird and wonderful things can occur.\nIn 1985, 18 million people across Britain stayed glued to their TV screens past midnight as Dennis Taylor beat Steve Davis in the most gripping World Championship final ever.\nTwo years earlier Canadian Cliff Thorburn made the first televised maximum 147 break as compatriot Bill Werbeniuk memorably peered around a partition.\nSnooker\'s unpredictable genius Alex \'Hurricane\' Higgins broke down in tears when he won the title in 1982 and in 1997 Ronnie \'Rocket\' O\'Sullivan swept a 147 in five minutes.\nOn Friday, snooker\'s spiritual home since 1977 witnessed more magic as England\'s Kyren Wilson beat Anthony McGill 17-16 in a semi-final decided in a surreal last frame.\nA 33rd frame spanning an hour featured nine successive failed attempts to get out of a snooker on the last red by McGill who conceded 43 points worth of fouls in the process.\nWilson almost handed the match back to McGill in an incredible sequence of play before fluking a green and eventually potting the pink to reach the final against O\'Sullivan.\n""That\'s the most incredible frame I\'ve ever seen at the Crucible,"" seven-time world champion Steven Hendry, commentating for the BBC, said.\nThe Scot was almost as lost for words later in the night as O\'Sullivan somehow fashioned a 17-16 win over Mark Selby by winning the last three frames having riled his opponent by crashing the cue ball around the table to lose the 30th frame rather than attempt to get out of a snooker.\nSadly there were no spectators in the Crucible to see the thrilling spectacle, with the British government having decided after one day of the two-week tournament to suspend its experiment to have fans back inside venues as part of the loosening of COVID-19 lockdown rules.\nA limited number of spectators will be present for the final, although for most people it will be viewed as it has always been, from the comfort of an armchair with a regular supply of tea and biscuits, or something stronger.\nWhen the pandemic forced organisers to postpone the championship in April, it deprived millions of locked-down Britons the reassuring click of colliding snooker balls.\nLOCKDOWN SPORT\nThankfully this year\'s event was given a new late July slot and with the country still mired in a health crisis, the kings of the green baize have provided a much-needed distraction from the daily diet of coronavirus updates.\nUnlike soccer matches, in which empty stadiums stand out like a sore thumb, snooker is the perfect lockdown sport. By nature it is played in silence with applause traditionally reserved for the conclusion of breaks or for special shots.\nSome players, the likes of O\'Sullivan attract more raucous followings, as was the case with past greats Jimmy \'Whirlwind\' White and Higgins. But the hushed arena creates its own energy.\nGiven Friday\'s incredible semi-finals, it would surely be asking too much for this weekend\'s decider to come anywhere close to Taylor\'s \'black ball\' decider against Davis in 1985 - the climax of which was watched by one third of Britain\'s population - still a post-midnight viewing record.\nDavis had led underdog Taylor 8-0 but the Northern Irishman, sporting comical-looking upside-down glasses for better vision, hauled himself back. After two gruelling days the final went down to the final black of the final frame.\nAt one point Taylor even approached the trophy and said a prayer and when Davis missed a black he would have made 99 times out of 100, it seemed divine intervention was at work.\nThe 36-year-old duly sunk the black and as the crowd erupted he brandished his cue above his head in a celebration that has become part of British TV folklore.\nIt was the peak of snooker\'s popularity when the players were as popular as today\'s Premier League footballers.\nThey even made a hit record with much-loved pop duo Chas and Dave called Snooker Loopy.\nThose heady days of table-top pantomime when players wore suits like the Bee Gees, dragged on cigarettes and downed pints of beer while sitting at their chairs have gone for good.\nThese days its the preserve of clean-cut, ultra-professional cuemen donning sponsors\' logos on their tailored suits.\nTelevised snooker no longer stops the country in its tracks but, as Friday proved, the geometric wizardry of the world\'s top potters is still an addictive spectacle.\n(Reporting by Martyn Herman, editing by Pritha Sarkar)\n', 'related_topics': ['     sports ']}"

      Adios Tiki-taka, Spain struggles to cope with the new game
  </h1>, 'text': ""LISBON: For the first time in 13 years, there is no Spanish team in the semi-finals of the Champions League and the way in which Barcelona were dumped out, with an 8-2 defeat to Bayern Munich, emphatically ended the era of La Liga supremacy.\nThere was one basic similarity in the way that Barcelona, Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid exited Europe this season - they simply looked too slow.\nIt is not that their players individually lack speed but that their styles of play lack the intensity and dynamism, the relentless pressing of the top German and English teams.\nThe Spanish sides are not able to attack with that same forcefulness, to turn from defence to attack in a matter of seconds, and they also defensively struggle to handle teams that play in such a manner.\nBarcelona's capitulation was the most blatant example of how far behind Spain has fallen in terms of the tactical evolution of the game.\nLess than a decade ago Barca were the cutting edge of modern football - their tiki-taka short passing game and their supreme control of possession simply condemned opponents to a painful death.\nUnder Pep Guardiola, they were technically outstanding and superbly drilled, with players developed from a young age to master the skills required to produce this geometric game few could handle.\nAn often under-estimated part of the Barca method under Guardiola, which brought Champions League titles in 2009 and 2011, was just how quickly his team could retrieve the ball once they had lost it.\nThere was little sense of that hunger to quickly seize back control against the rampant Germans on Friday.\nMore recently, Real Madrid's successes in Europe, with four Champions League titles between 2014 and 2018, came with a different style. But since the departure of Cristiano Ronaldo, they have lost their fear factor for opponents.\nEXPLOITED PERFECTLY\nLike Barca, they have struggled when trying to play the ball out from the back against an aggressive press - a factor which Guardiola, now with Manchester City, exploited perfectly in his side's win in the last 16.\nAtletico Madrid built their success under Diego Simeone, which included two runners-up spots in the Champions League and a pair of Europa League titles, on outstanding defending and a clinical counter-attack.\nBut they have lost the attacking element, shorn of the invention of Antoine Griezmann and with Diego Costa no longer the danger he once was.\nThe one team in Spain that is the closest to the modern form of playing are Sevilla, who are the last La Liga team left in Europe, facing a Europa League semi-final against Manchester United.\nSignificantly, Sevilla play with a pair of attacking full-backs in Reguilon and Jesus Navas - a crucial component for the continent's best.\nBayern, like last year's champions Liverpool, have full-backs who are key to their attacks - as the fifth goal created by left-back Alphonso Davies for right back Joshua Kimmich, emphasised.\nThat goal would have brought a wry smile from Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp, whose team have gained so much from the ability of his full-backs, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson, to deliver in the final third.\nIronically, it could be argued that the pioneer of that approach was Dani Alves at Barcelona, while Marcelo was a similar asset for Real Madrid.\nBut nothing emphasises how much times have changed than the way in which Guardiola, in Manchester, has evolved his own tactics.\nThe Catalan remains committed to the fundamentals of his beliefs - possession, crisp passing, the creation of space and the scamper to win back the ball.\nHis attacks always pressed but they do so now in a much more aggressive manner.\nPhil Foden, playing as a 'false nine' against Real in the last 16, used that position to close down and frustrate the attempts to play the ball out and striker Gabriel Jesus's pace was adopted for similar duties.\nBayern play that way, as do the other German semi-finalists RB Leipzig. Klopp's Liverpool, like his old club Borussia Dortmund, are masters in that method.\nSpanish coaches are among the greatest students of the game but they now have a new conundrum to solve - how to match teams who have pressed their clubs out of Europe.\n(Reporting by Simon Evans, Additional reporting by Richard Martin, editing by Pritha Sarkar)\n"", 'related_topics': ['     sports ', '     Barcelona ', '     Europe ', '     Pep Guardiola ', '     Spain ']}"

      Football: City and Guardiola at a cross-roads with mini-rebuild likely
  </h1>, 'text': 'LISBON: After being eliminated at the quarter-final stage of the Champions League for a third straight year, Manchester City and manager Pep Guardiola, perhaps unexpectedly, find themselves at a crossroads.\nDespite the criticism that Guardiola has faced for his cautious tactics in the 3-1 loss to Olympique Lyonnais on Saturday and the questions about whether he is over-complicating the task in Europe, there is no suggestion that the City hierarchy has lost confidence in the Spaniard.\nAfter all Guardiola masterminded impressive 2-1 home and away wins over La Liga winners and 13-times European champions Real Madrid in the last 16 that saw his team head to Lisbon.\nBut the fact remains that Guardiola has only one year left on his contract with the club and while he is reported to be ""open"" to an extension, he hasn\'t yet put pen to paper.\nThat itself wouldn\'t be a problem if City\'s hopes in the Champions League had materialised and he was looking to fine tune a winning team.\nBut City already had plenty of work to do in the transfer market, and after the Lyon defeat they may have even more recruitment to complete.\nAgents and players that City will be targeting will want to know if they are joining a club that is pushing ahead with Guardiola for the next few seasons or whether a change on the bench - and the uncertainty that brings - is on the horizon.\nGiven the closeness of the relationships between Guardiola and Director of Football Txiki Begiristain and Chief Executive Ferran Soriano, who all worked together at Barcelona, it shouldn\'t be difficult to get that situation ironed out.\nIt comes down to Guardiola\'s desire and the fact that he has already brought in two new signings for next season - winger Ferran Torres from Valencia and central defender Nathan Ake from Bournemouth - for a combined total of over £60 million (US$78.50 million) plus add-ons - shows that a mini-rebuild is already under-way.\nPROBLEM AREA\nTorres is effectively a replacement for Leroy Sane, the German winger who has left City for Bayern Munich, but Ake is not likely to be the only central defensive acquisition.\nThat area has long been a problem for Guardiola at City, a matter that was highlighted on Saturday with the much-criticised decision to play three central defenders due to concerns over a lack of pace.\nWhile Aymeric Laporte is the one fixed starter from Guardiola\'s list of defenders, 19-year-old Eric Garcia was a surprise start given he has turned down a contract extension and is widely expected to return to Barcelona.\nBrazilian Fernandinho has been converted into a defensive role from his previous midfield holding position but at 35, he isn\'t a long term solution.\nJohn Stones and Nicolas Otamendi were left on the bench and it would be no surprise if both were to be with different clubs very soon given Guardiola\'s evident lack of confidence in them.\nCity have been linked with Napoli\'s Senegalese defender Kalidou Koulibaly, although a deal for the 29-year-old might not be easy to pull off.\nEven trickier will be finding a replacement for David Silva, who is leaving the club after a decade of outstanding service. Bernardo Silva was seen as the natural successor but has been less prominent in Guardiola\'s plans this season.\nSome reports have linked City with Atletico Madrid\'s Portuguese talent Joao Felix, although the 20-year-old only moved to Spain from Benfica last year in a deal worth over 100 million pounds.\nThere are still questions over the left-back position, which Benjamin Mendy has yet to make his own, with the right-footed Joao Cancelo playing that role against Real and Lyon and there may be a temptation to look for a younger striker as back-up to Sergio Aguero and Gabriel Jesus.\nPlenty in Guardiola\'s in-tray then when he gets back to Manchester - he will probably be glad for the distraction.\n', 'related_topics': ['     sports ', '     football ', '     Pep Guardiola ', '     City ']}"

But the fact that the 61-year-old was ever handed the keys to the Camp Nou should be regarded as one of the club\'s biggest ever mistakes.\nIn a move that seemed to sum up the club\'s motto of \'More than a Club\', last January Barca took the surprising decision to sack Ernesto Valverde, whose side were top of La Liga at the time and had swept to back-to-back Spanish titles.\nMerely winning matches and trophies, the decision seemed to suggest, was no longer deemed good enough for a club that prides itself on producing top-class entertainment on the pitch.\nBut after being rejected by Xavi Hernandez and Ronald Koeman, Barca landed on Setien, who had never won a trophy and bizarrely remarked in his presentation that he got the call to coach Barca while strolling among cows in the countryside.\nHis previous biggest job was with Real Betis, where he presided over spectacular wins against the likes of Real Madrid, Barca and AC Milan but was ultimately sacked after a poor second season which saw him face mass protests from supporters.\nAn engaging and often idealistic coach, Setien was chosen due to his devotion to the coaching philosophy of Barca\'s iconic Johan Cruyff but he quickly proved to be hopelessly behind the times as the club\'s gamble badly backfired.\nHis side often served up soporific football that was slow and ponderous and frequently failed to win the games that mattered most, something Valverde usually managed, even if the football was not always exciting.\nSetien\'s Barca lost to Valencia and Real Madrid while drawing with Atletico Madrid, Sevilla and Celta Vigo, the latter three results coming in the final stretch of the season as they meekly surrendered the title to Real.\nThey did manage one outstanding performance in a 4-1 win over Villarreal but that was very much the exception that proved the rule, and another disappointment was just around the corner as the team lost 2-1 at home to Osasuna.\nThe usually softly-spoken and shy Lionel Messi let rip after that game, appearing to blame Setien for the team\'s predicament as he declared: ""Ever since January it has been all bad.""\nMessi finished his tirade by declaring Barca had no hope of winning the Champions League but surely not even he could have predicted his team would be beaten so brutally by Bayern.\nBut perhaps Setien\'s disastrous performance in the Champions League should have come as no surprise.\nAfter all, he had never taken charge of a game in Europe\'s top competition before leaving the serene countryside and grazing cows for the bear pit that is the Barca job.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Champions League ', '     sports ', '     Barca ']}"

  </h1>, 'text': 'REUTERS: After more than five decades of Brickyard frustration the ""Andretti Curse"" has become as much a part of the Indianapolis 500 as the command for drivers to ""start your engines"".\nAmerican motor racing royalty, the Andrettis have ruled over open wheel racing in the United States with a string of victories that have connected generations - father (Mario), to son (Michael), to grandson (Marco).\nBut for all their success at circuits around the world, Mario\'s Indy 500 victory in 1969 stands alone.\nOver the years what was first shrugged off as bad luck, became cruel misfortune then later a full blown jinx that now ranks right up there with the Boston Red Sox ""Curse of the Bambino"" and Chicago Cubs\' ""Curse of the Billy Goat"".\nFor those looking for signs that whatever voodoo planted on the Andrettis will be lifted this year, there were hints on Sunday that something was different when 33-year-old Marco grabbed pole position 33-years after Mario was the last Andretti to start from the front.\nThe Andrettis have happily played along when it comes to the curse, neither embracing or dismissing it.\nMarco routinely turns the tables saying his family is not cursed but blessed while at the same time conceding the results suggest darker forces at work.\nA theory this year has the curse thrown out of whack by the COVID-19 pandemic which forced the Indy 500 to move from its traditional May 24th date to Aug. 23.\n""I don\'t think it (the curse) exists in August so we are good,"" Andretti told Reuters with a laugh. ""As a family we would talk that we are blessed not cursed but it is a cool media story and we have been running with it.\n""Results wise, yeah, maybe there is something to it because man the three of us have been so dominate here.\n""We have a bunch of podiums but this is one place where that doesn\'t matter.""\nCertainly when it comes to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and the Andrettis relationship has been more star-crossed than aligned.\nMarco\'s father Michael, has been a five-times winner of the Indy 500 as a team owner but 16 times as a driver could not get to Victory Lane.\nIn his 2006 rookie season Marco finished second but has never been that close again.\nAn American driver winning the Indianapolis 500 will have fans waving the Stars and Stripes - an Andretti winning ""The Greatest Spectacle in Racing"" would bring fireworks.\nFans, drivers and anyone connected to motor racing understands what the Andretti name means to the sport.\nWhen Marco\'s name flashed at the top of the timing tower on Sunday social media exploded and the pit lane applauded.\nFellow drivers ran to Marco\'s car to offer congratulations while his father hugged him and fought back tears.\nDue to COVID-19 health and safety protocols there will be no spectators in grandstands that normally would be packed with close to 300,000 motor racing fans.\nEither way Andretti says he will still feel the support.\n""Just feeling the support from the pole I can\'t even imagine what it would be like if we won the race,"" said Marco. ""You would see a few grown men cry.\n""Just seeing the videos of fans across the street wearing my jersey, that\'s so cool and the unwavering support on social media.""\n(Reporting by Steve Keating in Toronto.

  </h1>, 'text': 'LISBON:\xa0Paris St Germain reached their first ever Champions League final with a convincing 3-0 win over RB Leipzig on Tuesday (Aug 18), finally delivering the reward of the biggest game in European football for their Qatari backers.\nGoals from Marquinhos and Angel\xa0Di\xa0Maria\xa0put PSG 2-0 up at the interval and Juan Bernat added the third in the 56th minute for what was a comfortable victory at the Estadio da Luz.\nThe French club, celebrating the 50th anniversary of their founding in 1970, will meet the winner of Wednesday\'s other semi between Bayern Munich and Olympique Lyonnais after ending what some felt was a mental block in the knockout stages.\nPSG have gone out in the last 16 for the past three years, but they proved a step too far for Leipzig, who were playing in the regional leagues just 11 years ago.\nThe Germans, financed by the Red Bull energy drink company, have outperformed all expectations by reaching the last four, knocking out Tottenham Hotspur and Atletico Madrid en route.\n""We showed quality and determination. A good mix. We deserved to win,"" said Tuchel, who had faced a heavy expectation to deliver in Europe this season.\n""I felt the pressure, it was not easy. I have players who are used to playing with this pressure, who like this pressure and these decisive matches.""\nWith French World Cup winning forward Kylian Mbappe back in the starting line-up after fully recovering from his ankle injury, Tuchel was able to field his preferred attacking trident with Brazilian Neymar and\xa0Di\xa0Maria.\nRight from the outset, PSG looked a threat to the Leipzig defence with Neymar clipping the post after he was slipped in by Mbappe in the sixth minute.\nSeven minutes later though, PSG had the lead - Neymar and\xa0Di\xa0Maria\xa0lined up to take a free kick on the left and it was the Argentine who floated in a lovely cross which was nodded home by Marquinhos.\nFormer Real Madrid and Manchester United winger\xa0Di\xa0Maria\xa0was in fine form, constantly probing, while Neymar created from deep and Mbappe pushed on to the last defender looking to use his pace.\nThe Germans were struggling but\xa0did threaten in the 25th minute when Konrad Laimer burst down the right and found Yussuf Poulsen but the forward\'s shot was just off target.\nNeymar then went close with an audacious free kick from deep and wide on the right, the former Barcelona man going for Peter Gulacsi\'s near post and striking the post as the Hungarian keeper scrambled.\nIt was a poor clearance from the keeper which led to PSG\'s second. Leandro Paredes collected the ball and then found Neymar who cleverly flicked it with the back of his heel into the path of\xa0Di\xa0Maria\xa0who made no mistake.\nBEYOND DOUBT\nLeipzig\'s 33-year-old coach Julian Nagelsmann needed to find some way to shift the momentum of the game and made two changes at the break but after a bright start, PSG put the outcome beyond doubt.\nLeipzig defender Nordi\xa0Mukiele slipped while attempting to clear, allowing\xa0Di\xa0Maria\xa0to cross the ball back in to the box and Bernat\'s glancing header floated into the far corner.\nMbappe forced a good save out of Gulacsi as PSG pushed for a fourth while PSG keeper Sergio Rico had his hands warmed by a fierce drive from fellow Spaniard Angelino.\n""After the second goal, the belief of our players went down a little bit,"" said Nagelsmann.\n""That\'s normal. It\'s not that easy right now to think about the good season we\'ve had in the Champions League but in one week it will be ok. We know that it was a good season for a young team and we will try to do it again next season,"" he said.\nThe French club have played 110 games in the competition -\xa0the most played by a side before reaching their first final, overtaking Arsenal\'s record of 90 between 1971-2006.\nPSG\'s only other appearances in the final of a European competition came with their UEFA Cup Winners\' Cup victory in 1996 and their runners-up spot in the following season.\nOlympique Marseille are the only French team to win the European Cup, triumphing over AC Milan in 1993.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Champions League ', '     sports ', '     PSG ', '     Leipzig ', '     final ']}"

      Stick or twist? Flick faces final tactical dilemma
  </h1>, 'text': ""LISBON: Bayern Munich's success in reaching the final of the Champions League has been built on a very distinct tactical approach but it is one that carries big risks against Paris St Germain, leaving coach Hansi Flick with a major dilemma.\nBayern play an aggressive pressing game, pinning back their opponents, maintaining pressure on their defence and making it difficult for them to move the ball through the midfield.\nIt is an approach that has worked superbly in the knockout games in the Portuguese capital with Barcelona simply swept aside in an astonishing 8-2 victory for the Germans and then Olympique Lyonnais succumbing 3-0 in the semi-finals.\nIn 2020, not one team has managed to beat Bayern, with only RB Leipzig managing a draw back in February. In addition to their dominance domestically, Flick's side have won every game in the Champions League this season.\nThe Bayern approach shows the increasing irrelevance of describing tactical approaches via numerical formations - after all, Robert Lewandowski is their only striker but he is far from alone.\nThe Pole leads the line but the press comes from a trio behind him - Serge Gnabry on the right, Thomas Mueller centrally and Ivan Perisic on the left.\nLeon Goretzka and Thiago Alcantara are hardly typical 'holding midfielders' with Goretzka in particular helping pin-back opposition defences.\nCrucially, the two full backs get into advanced positions, creating the 'swarming effect' that so many teams cannot cope with.\nAlphonso Davies on the left, is the epitome of the modern, attacking full back, while Joshua Kimmich, who has deputised for the injured Benjamin Pavard, is a midfield player by nature.\nThe only problem with this approach is that it only works if Bayern's defence plays a very high-line and compresses the game.\nThat carries with it the risk of opposition attacks with pace getting behind the back of Bayern's defence with long balls forward or swift, well-constructed counter-attacks.\nLyon managed to do just that on Wednesday but lacked the clinical finishing to make the most of the opportunities that came their way.\nPSG's attack, with Neymar and Kylian Mbappe, is unlikely to be so forgiving.\nMbappe, in particular, presents a real problem given his lightning speed from the left flank. Neymar's ability to make runs from deeper positions and Angel Di Maria's ability to pick them out with the perfect pass mean Bayern's back line will be tested on Sunday.\nIn particular Davies and Kimmich or Frenchman Pavard, if he is chosen after coming back from injury, will have to be as accomplished defensively as they have been with the ball.\nFlick could reduce the danger of Mbappe by springing Bayern's offside trap, ordering his defence to play deeper, reducing the space able to be exploited behind them.\nBut that would stretch the game and work contrary to Bayern's game-plan in the opposition's half.\nIt is a classic case of stick or twist?\nThe good news for those hoping for an exciting game is that, so far, Flick has shown no inclination to alter his approach.\n(Reporting by Simon Evans; Editing by Christian Radnedge)\n"", 'related_topics': ['     sports ', '     Bayern ']}"

      50-year-old 'newcomers' PSG finally make the biggest stage
  </h1>, 'text': 'LISBON: The Champions League final between Bayern Munich and Paris St Germain on Sunday is a clash of two of the modern giants of the European game but in terms of footballing history, it is the French club who are the relative newcomers.\nFor not only will this be PSG\'s first final in the competition, it comes 11 days after they celebrated only their 50th anniversary as a club.\nTo give some perspective, Bayern are 120 years old while last year\'s winners Liverpool were formed in 1892.\nIndeed, when Bayern won the first of their five European Cup titles in 1973, PSG were just three years old and playing in the French third division.\nWhile French football has a long and rich history, the capital city was noticeably absent from the elite with Parisians showing little interest in the game as provincial clubs like St Etienne and Reims enjoyed continental success.\nThose in the capital who followed the game made the most of brief moments of promise for the small, older traditional clubs, Red Star and Racing Club, until the creation of PSG.\nThe merger of the new Paris Football Club and Stade Saint-Germanois in 1970 created a team for the changing population of the capital. A French Cup win came in 1982 and four years later, they won their first league title.\nWith backing from television company Canal Plus, the club attracted top talent such as winger David Ginola and Liberian striker George Weah.\nBy 1996, the club had made its mark on the international stage with a team featuring Brazil midfielder Rai and France international Youri Djorkaeff helping them win the European Cup Winners\' Cup with a 1-0 victory over Rapid Vienna.\nPSG started being able to attract big names, with Ronaldinho joining in 2001, but the key moment of change came 10 years later when Qatar Sports Investment took control of the club\nThe Qataris began a huge investment in talent and top managers as they sought to create a \'superclub\' to match global brands such as Barcelona and Real Madrid.\nDavid Beckham ended his career at PSG while Zlatan Ibrahimovic brought his huge personality to Paris and, domestically, the club have dominated the French league, winning seven of the last eight championships.\nSuccess in Europe has been harder to find however. For all the money spent, including a world record 222 million euros for Brazilian Neymar, PSG failed to get beyond the quarter-finals stage in the Champions League.\nUntil this year.\nWins over Italy\'s Atalanta and Germany\'s RB Leipzig have propelled Thomas Tuchel\'s side, powered by local hero Kylian Mbappe, to a place in club football\'s biggest game.\nLuis Fernandez, who played for the club in the 1970s and \'80s and was manager of the team which won the Cup Winners\' Cup in 1996, appreciates the sense of history.\n""Generations follow one another, but you can feel that those who have lived our adventure know it and have loved it,"" he said.\n""I also remember playing in the Champions League. It\'s a always a beautiful night of football, it\'s a different approach. Every year there are expectations. We opened the way with the Cup Winners\' Cup.""\n(Reporting by Simon Evans; Editing by Ian Chadband)\n', 'related_topics': ['     Champions League ', '     sports ', '     PSG ', '     club ', '     France ']}"

      Commentary: Messi and Ronaldo are the best ever. We will not see any more like them
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: When historians look back at football in the first quarter of the 21st century, they will see a time of great change in the world’s most popular sport.\nWhat was already a global game with millions pouring in the 1990s, quickly turned into a sport with billion-dollar broadcasting deals, with sovereign wealth funds investing in clubs and transfer fee amounts for players increasing from a few million pounds to hundreds of million pounds.\nWhat may make them really shake their head in wonder however is how two players were clear at the sport’s pinnacle for so long.\nAlthough the pace of change in football has been exponential since the early 2000s, one thing has remained constant - the game has seen the phenomenal rise of Lionel Messi of Argentina and Portugal’s Cristiano Ronaldo to the top, where they have remained for most of this century.\nRarely has there been any other footballer who has mirrored the sustained success of both of these players in individual and team success.\nUNPARALLELED SUCCESS\nBoth players are not shy of individual honours. In 2007, the two stars made the top three of the prestigious FIFA Player of the Year -previously known as the Ballon D’or - in which players, journalists and coaches vote for the best player that year.\xa0\nSince then, only in 2018 has a player other than Ronaldo or Messi - Croatia’s Luka Modric - been named as the best in the world.\nThen there are the trophies. Ronaldo won the UEFA Champions League, regarded as the pinnacle in European club football, in 2008 with Manchester United and then headed to Real Madrid the following year for a world record fee at the time of 80 million pounds to win four more Champions League titles.\nMessi, who has stayed at Barcelona throughout his career, has won the Champions League a total of four times and Spain’s La Liga on 10 occasions.\nRonaldo has won seven national leagues: Three in England during his six seasons with Manchester United, two in Spain with Real Madrid and two with his current club, Juventus in Italy.\nSo consistent have they been that this year is the first since 2006 that neither player has appeared in the semi-finals of the Champions League.\nAnd then there are the amazing statistics.\nRonaldo scored 311 goals in 292 games in nine years for Real Madrid. From the 2009 to 2010 season onwards, Messi has never scored less than 41 goals until this year, including a breathtaking 73 goals in the 2011 to 2012 season.\nTogether, they have scored over 630 club goals.\nMessi has 214 club assists to Ronaldo’s 134. Both have shone for their countries with Ronaldo one goal short of a century for Portugal and Messi having 70 goals for Argentina.\nIT’S HOW LONG THEY WERE THE BEST\nSuch statistics are unprecedented especially when sustained over a number of years.\nThere have been legendary players in the past but there has never been a pair so dominant at the same time and for such a long time.\nIn attacking terms, Pele of Brazil, Dutch maestro Johann Cryuff and Argentina’s Diego Maradona are seen as giants but had their peak in separate decades: The sixties, seventies and eighties.\xa0\nRonaldo, the Brazilian striker, regarded as the world’s best forward from the mid-nineties shone almost for a decade.\nZinedine Zidane was around at the same time but while the French playmaker helped his country to the 1998 World Cup and the final of the 2006 version, he won just one Champions League medal.\nZidane and Ronaldo were world-class but did not define an era.\nIt is the duopoly of Messi and Ronaldo that mark them out. For years, fans around the world have been divided - helped by the rise of social media - into two camps, arguing that their man is better than the other and therefore the best in the world.\nEND OF AN ERA\nThe debates continue but the end of the era is in sight now.\nAt club level, Ronaldo’s Juventus lost at the last 16 stage of the Champions League against Lyon, a team that finished seventh in the French league. Messi’s experience was worse.\xa0\nBarcelona reached the quarter-final but were humiliated last week by Bayern Munich, losing 8-2 to the German giants.\nIt was not surprising then that there were reports of Messi’s disillusionment with the Spanish giants. There have been reports that Ronaldo could also leave Juventus.\nBoth players would be welcomed around the world and the transfer would be huge news but, at the final stages of their careers, would not now command the biggest transfer fee.\nRonaldo is 35 and Messi is 33. Both are still world-class but it is no longer automatic that one of the pair is the best player in the world.\xa0\nLast September, although Messi was crowned FIFA Player of the Year for a record sixth time, many felt that second-placed Liverpool defender Virgil Van Dijk deserved the award more, with Ronaldo settling for third place.\nClearly, other players are knocking on their doors to knock the duo off their perch. But it is doubtful that any of those contenders can attain the same level of success that Messi and Ronaldo have or even for that long. \xa0\nSUCCESSORS TO THE CROWN\nOne of those is Neymar, who holds the current world transfer record of 222 million Euros that Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) paid to Barcelona for the Brazilian forward in 2017.\nNeymar, a former team-mate of Messi, was overshadowed by the Argentine at the club but has not yet managed to outshine the Argentine in the French capital. Neymar may be regarded as world-class but has much to do to match the individual and on-field success of Messi and Ronaldo.\xa0\nNeymar’s PSG team-mate Kylian Mbappe was in March ranked by Spanish newspaper Marca as the highest-valued player in the world at 200 million Euros.\nAt 21, the Frenchman has already won the World Cup and has a bright future but, at club level, playing for PSG in the French Ligue 1 means that he does not compete directly with the best in the world.\nFor him to prove and establish himself as the world’s best, he needs to be playing against and among the best in the world in the more competitive leagues in England, Spain, Italy or Germany.\xa0\nThere are others who are establishing their credentials too – Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane at Liverpool, Raheem Sterling at Manchester City, Eden Hazard at Real Madrid, and Modric – with the latter two also shining at the 2018 World Cup, along with Mbappe.\nDespite their potential to be crowned the world’s best in the next few years, they may not be able to stay too long at the top with the average age of the players above to be 28.\nAt this age, Ronaldo had already scored 300 club goals, became his country’s all-time top scorer and captain, as well as won the FIFA Best Player Award not to mention the numerous titles and cups, while Messi had already been Barcelona’s and La Liga’s highest all-time goalscorer and had won five FIFA Best Player awards.\nThis shows that by 28, both Messi and Ronaldo were already well established at the top of the sport and not just showing potential. They were clearly in a class of their own.\nWORLD CUP ALLUDES THEM\nInterestingly, both Messi\xa0and Ronaldo have not won the World Cup, something that the previous greats such as Maradona, Pele and Zidane have done and is a common criticism raised by those who question their respective tags as the greatest ever footballer. \xa0\nThat is a fair criticism but one that can be countered by their incredible consistency at club level. Arguably, the club level football today in Europe’s top leagues is more competitive and demanding than the once-in-four years World Cup.\nEither way, the World Cup is unlikely now for either Messi or Ronaldo. At 35 and 37 respectively in 2022, they may not be playing at the next World Cup.\nBut they don’t need the trophy to be remembered as the best players in the world for over a decade. To have two such stars shine at the same time for so long may never happen again.\nJohn Duerden has lived in Asia for 20 years and covers the region’s sporting scene.

So we will think about it in the future for sure,"" Ceferin told Reuters in an interview.\nThe UEFA president said that without a second-leg to fall back on, teams have been forced to go for goals.\n“(There has been) not so much tactics. If it is one match, if one team scores then the other has to score as soon as possible. If it is two legged system then there is still time to win the next match,"" he said.\n""More exciting matches for sure but of course we also have to think about the fact that we have less matches and broadcasters (can) say ‘you don’t have as many matches as before, this is different’ so we will have to discuss when this crazy situation ends.""\nThe \'final eight\' tournament took place without fans in stadiums and the prospect of supporters from eight clubs descending on one city could cause security issues among other logistical problems.\nThe current format is locked in place contractually until 2024/2025 but discussions are due to begin later this year on the structure for the competition for the next phase.\nCONGESTED CALENDAR\nThe tournament was played over 11 days and clearing space in the congested international calendar would be another obstacle to overcome but Ceferin is clearly intrigued by the possibilities.\n“Look for sure it is a very interesting format. Now, I doubt as much as the calendar is now, that we could do a final eight (tournament), because it would take too much time. But a format with one match and a system like it is now, I think it would be much more exciting than the format that was before,"" he said.\n“If we would play this system then, but we haven’t discussed with anyone its just an idea, we would play in one city. If you play in one city, you can have a week of football or something like that. But it is far too early to think about it.\n""We have seen it as a big success and the viewership over TV has been huge, maybe it also good because it is August and people are at home, some of them at least, but interesting, interesting tournament.""\nAs well as the Champions League, UEFA has also held a similar tournament to complete the Europa League season and has held the finales to the UEFA Youth League and the UEFA Women\'s Champions League.\n“It was not an easy task, trust me.

""I feel a bit sad for Paris. They\'ve had an extraordinary journey. We must respect what Paris have done.\n""We tried to put a lot of pressure on them. We didn\'t concede a goal, that\'s the most important thing. It was a great final.""\nComan, who had also missed out on France\'s winning 2018 World Cup run through injury, was not even expected to be in the starting lineup against PSG.\nA surprise change by coach Hansi Flick brought the speedy Frenchman in for Ivan Perisic, with Coman on a good day strong in one-on-one situations and quicker than the Croatian down the wing.\nThe coach\'s move proved a masterstroke as Coman, lurking at the far post, beat defender Thilo Kehrer and headed in a Joshua Kimmich cross for the winner in the 59th minute.\nConsecutive injuries in 2017 and 2018 saw Coman miss the major part of both seasons and followed ankle ligament injuries in 2016 after he had joined the Bavarians the previous year. The France international even considered retiring.\n""It was a very difficult year. When I hurt myself, it was the end of the world for me."" Coman said in 2018.\n""I hope I don\'t have to relive what I\'ve been through. Enough is enough. I will not accept a third operation - it will mean maybe my foot is not made for this level.\n""I will then lead another life, an anonymous life.""\nHe again struggled with injuries last season and missed the round-of-16 second leg against Chelsea.\nOn Sunday, however, he finally got to shine on the biggest stage and to live up to his talent.\n', 'related_topics': ['     sports ', '     Bayern ', '     France ', '     Champions League ']}"

We were surprised the games could have this effect on language because most diversity education programmes fail to change behaviours.""\nThe study surveyed players from eight teams in the semi-professional Australian Ice Hockey League and asked them about their use of, and exposure to, homophobic language.\nIt found that players that took part in the LGBT-themed matches were around 20per cent less likely to have used a homophobic slur over the previous two weeks compared to athletes who did not take part in the contest.\nFurther, the athletes who took part in the themed game were 15per cent less likely to have heard one of their team mates use homophobic language in the previous two weeks.\nA 2015 international report ""Out On The Fields"", co-authored by Denison, found that 80per cent of people of all sexualities had witnessed or experienced homophobia in a sporting environment.\n(Reporting by Nick Mulvenney, editing by Peter Rutherford)\n', 'related_topics': ['     sports ', '     Australia ', '     LGBT ', '     player ']}"

  </h1>, 'text': ""BARCELONA: When Barcelona confirmed they had received a request from Lionel Messi's lawyers informing them he wanted to terminate one of football's longest-standing relationships, the owners of Europe's biggest clubs would have raised a collective eyebrow.\nIt was akin to the Mona Lisa suddenly becoming available on the art market, such is Messi's status in the game despite the fact that he is 33 and the magic might soon begin to fade.\nAlready the usual suspects are being lined up as Messi's next club with, not surprisingly, a reunion with his former manager Pep Guardiola at Manchester City the most likely scenario according to the bookmakers.\nThere is talk of Messi joining forces with Cristiano Ronaldo, his long-term rival as the world's greatest player, at Juventus or linking-up again with Neymar at Paris St Germain as they bid to end their Champions League jinx.\nInter Milan's Chinese owners would also see Messi as the player to turn them back into a European force.\nRolling TV sports channels and social media were buzzing with Messi's Barca bombshell on Wednesday.\nYet despite the inevitable excitement, it is by no means certain Messi will have multiple options if the split with the Catalan giants he joined as a teenager in 2001 is irreparable.\nMessi insists a clause in his contract allows him to leave for free - a scenario that would attract a frenzy of suitors.\nBarcelona, however, say that clause has expired and a rival club must pay his release clause of €700 million (US$826 million) if he is to leave without the club's consent.\nShould Barcelona stick to their guns it would knock most potential buyers out of the ball park, especially with Messi's one million euros per week salary demand.\nThe marketing men will point to the avalanche of shirt sales and Messi merchandising that the six-time Ballon d'Or winner would guarantee, not to mention his disciples around the globe swelling the club's fanbase.\nFinances aside, though, there is an even bigger question mark hanging over Messi. Is he a fading force?\nIt sounds churlish to suggest that of a player who remains the heartbeat of one of Europe's biggest clubs for whom he has helped win over 30 trophies, but none last season.\nYet his 31 goals in all competitions last season, impressive by ordinary standards, was not exceptional.\nAfter all, this is a player who holds the La Liga scoring record of 444. He once scored 79 club goals in a calendar year, and is the only player to score more than 40 goals for his club in 10 consecutive seasons.\nMessi's disenchantment with the club's hierarchy, notably club president Josep Maria Bartomeu, could have been a factor in the transfer request but even a footballing genius cannot defy the passing years.\nOn the other hand a fresh challenge might spark a golden final chapter to his glittering career. The question is where?\nMessi has made no secret of his admiration for the Premier League and Manchester City would seem the most logical fit.\nGuardiola would surely relish a reunion with Messi as he rebuilds a side eclipsed by Liverpool last season.\nAfter their brush with UEFA's Financial Fair Play rules, even Abu Dhabi-owned City might shy away from a 700 million price tag, especially with other areas of the pitch in serious need of strengthening.\nManchester United's owners, the Glazer family, might see signing Messi as a way of winning over sceptical fans, while Chelsea's benefactor Roman Abramovich has re-opened his chequebook with a vengeance and will, like the rest of the soccer world, be closely monitoring events.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     sports ', '     Barcelona ', '     Europe ', '     Lionel Messi ']}"

  </h1>, 'text': 'WELLINGTON: Seilala Mapusua is well aware of the challenges facing him after he was appointed Samoa\'s national rugby coach but thinks there is now a real desire among the game\'s powerbrokers to resolve some of the issue facing Tier Two nations.\nThe former Samoa international was appointed earlier this month to succeed Steve Jackson, who took the side to last year\'s Rugby World Cup in Japan.\nThe 40-year-old Mapusua, who carved out a long professional career in New Zealand, Britain and Japan, is the fourth coach the side has had in four years.\nThat turnover reflects some of the instability at the South Pacific rugby nations of Samoa, Fiji and Tonga, who routinely face problems related to funding, domestic pathways, player release and inequity of resources.\nMapusua, however, said the novel coronavirus outbreak, which has halted international rugby, may have a silver lining.\n""What COVID has done is presented us with an opportunity to work towards a global season,"" Mapusua told Reuters from Dunedin on Thursday. ""I think everyone is crying out for it.""\nWorld Rugby cancelled all tests in their June window and have been involved in discussions about realigning the seasons in both hemispheres.\nMapusua said one of the benefits of a global calendar would be to end friction between clubs and national sides.\nPacific nations have complained that clubs sometimes put indirect pressure on players to not make themselves available for tests, even for World Cups.\n""Once we have a global season that will eliminate that club v country issue that really only the Tier Two players have to deal with,"" Mapusua said.\n""Tier One teams don\'t have to worry about that club versus country battle. Hopefully in the next 12 months we can see some movement in that space.""\nMapusua was also keen for World Rugby to address eligibility rules, where players can only represent one country at senior level.\nThe Pacific Players union has suggested players who have represented Tier One teams could undergo a stand down period before being allowed to represent a Tier Two side if they have the appropriate heritage or citizenship.\nSuch a change would allow players like former All Blacks Charles Piutau and Steven Luatua, both of whom were born in New Zealand but left to sign lucrative European contracts, to appear for Tonga and Samoa respectively.\n""I would love to see the world\'s best players at a pinnacle event like the World Cup,"" Mapusua said.\n""Having those guys in the island teams and showing the local guys what they go through, what they can contribute in terms of development of our national teams (is massive).""\n(Editing by Peter Rutherford)\n', 'related_topics': ['     COVID-19 ', '     sports ']}"

      Basketball: NBA players decide to continue season after boycott over racial injustice
  </h1>, 'text': 'NEW YORK:\xa0National Basketball Association (NBA) players agreed on Thursday (Aug 27) not to boycott the rest of the season after forcing the postponement of a slate of playoff games in a protest against racial injustice and police brutality.\nUS\xa0President Donald Trump on Thursday said the NBA has become ""like a political organization"" after its boycott in solidarity with those protesting the police shooting of a Black man in the Wisconsin town of Kenosha. The Sunday shooting triggered days of violent unrest and has riled US\xa0professional sports.\nNBA Executive Vice President Mike Bass said the league is ""hopeful"" to resume games either on Friday or Saturday, but was postponing a second day of playoff games on Thursday.\nAfter the Milwaukee Bucks refused to take the court for Game 5 of their playoff series against the Orlando Magic on Wednesday, the NBA postponed all three games on the day\'s schedule and on Thursday postponed three more games that had been set for later in the day. Major League Baseball, Major League Soccer and the WNBA also postponed games on Wednesday. The women\'s league postponed its Thursday games as well.\nThe Bucks players said in a statement on Wednesday they were unable to focus on basketball due to the events in Kenosha, which is located about 60km\xa0south of Milwaukee.\nThe NBA players decided to resume the playoffs after meeting among themselves in the bubble-like campus at Disney World in Florida, where the games are being played due to the coronavirus pandemic. The NBA Board of Governors held an emergency meeting on Thursday.\nSince the NBA restarted its pandemic-interrupted season, courts have had ""Black Lives Matter"" painted on them and many players have worn jerseys with social justice slogans. NBA referees marched on Thursday around the Disney campus in support of the players, wearing black T-shirts with messages like ""Everybody vs\xa0Racism"" and ""Black Lives Matter.""\nBass said there is a conference call scheduled for later Thursday between a group of NBA players and team officials, along with representatives from the players\' union and the NBA\'s Labor Relations Committee chairman, Michael Jordan, ""to discuss next steps.""\nTRUMP TARGETS NBA\nTrump, during a briefing at the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Hurricane Laura, criticised the NBA.\n""They\'ve become like a political organisation and that\'s not a good thing. I don\'t think that\'s a good thing for sports or for the country,"" he said.\nJared Kushner, Trump\'s son-in-law and adviser, told Politico he planned to reach out to NBA star LeBron James of the Los Angeles Lakers about the player protests.\nJames, a four-time NBA Most Valuable Player, wrote on Twitter on Thursday: ""Change doesn\'t happen with just talk!! It happens with action and needs to happen NOW!""\nKushner told CNBC that ""NBA players are very fortunate that they have the financial position where they\'re able to take a night off from work without having to have the consequences to themselves financially"" and that the players have ""put a lot of slogans out"" rather than ""actual action.""\nAnother White House official, Marc Short, called the NBA players\' protests ""absurd"" and ""silly.""\nJames, along with other NBA players and coaches, has been critical of Trump in the past. In 2018, he accused Trump of trying to use sports to divide Americans. Trump that year questioned James\' intelligence.\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden, Trump\'s Democratic challenger in the Nov\xa03 presidential election, and his running mate Senator Kamala Harris - the first Black woman on a major-party ticket - praised the actions of the NBA players.\n""It takes monumental courage to stand up for what you believe in,"" Harris said.\nThe Hockey Diversity Alliance, which works against racism and intolerance in hockey, called on the National Hockey League to suspend its two playoff games scheduled for Thursday.\nAthletes from around the world have united behind anti-racism protests sparked by the death of George Floyd, a Black man in police custody in Minneapolis in May.\nKenosha has been rocked by civil unrest and violence since Sunday, when police shot Jacob Blake, 29, in the back seven times at close range in an incident captured on video.

Concerns remain over his fitness, with Djokovic admitting that contracting COVID-19 had affected his stamina.\nDominic Thiem (Austria)\nWorld ranking: 3\nBorn: Sept. 3, 1993 (Age 26)\nGrand Slam titles: 0\nATP career titles: 16\nBest U.S. Open performance: Quarter-finals (2018)\nThiem relies on his punishing forehand to dictate baseline rallies. One of the fittest players on tour, he does not shy away from long five-set contests.\nHis ultra-aggressive approach can backfire at times though, with the Austrian leaking unforced errors when his game is not firing on all cylinders.\nThiem has suffered defeats in three Slam finals and question marks remain over his ability to clear the final hurdle.\nStefanos Tsitsipas\nWorld ranking: 6\nBorn: Aug. 12, 1998 (Age 22)\nGrand Slam titles: 0\nATP career titles: 5\nBest U.S. Open performance: Second round (2018)\nVersatility is Tsitsipas' calling card. The flamboyant Greek is just as comfortable finishing points off at the net as he is grinding down opponents from the back of the court.\nTsitsipas has never been beyond the second round at Flushing Meadows and a middling backhand that can come under fire against top players lengthen his odds of becoming the first Greek Grand Slam champion.\nDaniil Medvedev\nWorld ranking: 5\nBorn: Feb. 11, 1996 (Age 24)\nGrand Slam titles: 0\nATP career titles: 7\nBest U.S. Open performance: Runner-up (2019)\nA patient baseliner, Medvedev's flat and unorthodox groundstrokes can force opponents into a flurry of unforced errors. He's also capable of going toe-to-toe with the best players across five sets, as shown by last year's epic final against Rafa Nadal.\nBut the volatile Russian possesses a notoriously short fuse and the red mist can descend quickly. His all-or-nothing approach on second serves can lead to his downfall in the pressure-cooker atmosphere of Arthur Ashe Stadium.\nAlexander Zverev\nWorld ranking: 7\nBorn: April 20, 1997 (Age 23)\nGrand Slam titles: 0\nATP career titles: 11\nBest U.S. Open performance: Fourth round (2019)\nA punishing first serve and rock-solid backhand put Zverev in prime position to become the first German man to win the U.S. Open since Boris Becker in 1989.\nThe lanky Zverev reached his maiden major semi-final in Melbourne this year, erasing doubts over his Grand Slam credentials.\nHowever, a shaky second serve and fragile forehand could be his undoing in the later rounds.\nAndy Murray (Great Britain)\nWorld ranking: 134\nBorn: May 15, 1987 (Age 33)\nGrand Slam titles: 3 (Wimbledon 2013, 2016; U.S. Open 2012)\nATP career titles: 46\nBest U.S. Open performance: Winner (2012)\nMurray's chances of lifting the U.S. Open trophy are slim but the gritty Scotsman is more than capable of springing an upset or two as he returns to the site of his maiden Grand Slam triumph.\nMurray's last appearance at a major was the 2019 Australian Open and he has since undergone hip surgery that has limited his time on court.\nHe showed flashes of his best in this week's Western & Southern Open, downing world number seven Alexander Zverev for his first win over a top-10 player since 2017.\nWhile he has retained his thirst for success, he has lost some of his trademark swiftness and doubts remain over his ability to last five sets.\n(Compiled by Arvind Sriram in Bengaluru; Editing by Ken Ferris)\n"", 'related_topics': ['     sports ', '     title ', '     ATP ', '     U.S. Open ', '     Grand Slam ']}"

""We don\'t really know how we\'re going to feel on the court.""\nDominic Thiem has had three attempts at ending the Grand Slam hegemony of the Big Three but lost the previous two French Open finals to Nadal while going down to Djokovic in this year\'s Australian Open title clash.\nThe third-ranked Austrian\'s preparations suffered a jolt when he crashed out of the Western & Southern Open in straight sets to Filip Krajinovic in his first match.\nLast year\'s U.S. Open finalist Daniil Medvedev, Alexander Zverev and Stefanos Tsitsipas have had some big wins in their careers but not many will bet on them prevailing against Djokovic\'s machine-like precision on hardcourts.\nThree-time Grand Slam champion Murray is currently ranked 134th after undergoing two hip surgeries but a win against a top-10 player is not beyond him as Zverev found out this week.\n(Reporting by Sudipto Ganguly in Mumbai; Editing by Ken Ferris)\n', 'related_topics': ['     New York ', '     sports ', '     Novak Djokovic ', '     Serbia ', '     Grand Slam ']}"

  </h1>, 'text': 'LONDON: Former champion Andy Murray has set himself a low bar at this year\'s U.S. Open in what will be his first singles appearance at a Grand Slam since the 2019 Australian Open.\nTwo hip surgeries later and having seemingly recovered from the pelvic issues that sidelined him before the COVID-19 shutdown in March, Murray is not fooling anyone though.\nDespite having played only three matches on the ATP Tour since last October, the 33-year-old Scot has not entered the Big Apple\'s bio-secure bubble simply to make up the numbers.\nIn this week\'s Western & Southern Open, held at Flushing Meadows, Murray beat world number seven Alexander Zverev in the second round - his first win over a top-10 player since 2017.\nHe was subsequently pummelled by big-serving Canadian Milos Raonic in the next round, but the victory over Germany\'s Zverev would have caught the attention of the rest of the field.\nThree-time Grand Slam champion Murray may be ranked 134th and he might be in the twilight of his career, but the top seeds will be anxious to avoid him in the draw.\nIn reality a run to the third or fourth round would be a sizeable feat for a player whose hip was rebuilt in January 2019 in a last desperate attempt to salvage his career.\nWhen he won the Antwerp title last October, his first since 2017, it looked as though he had rediscovered his former powers, but since then a series of nagging injuries and the enforced lay-off caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has stalled his return.\nPHYSCIAL CONDITION\nMurray, who beat Novak Djokovic to win his first Grand Slam title at Flushing Meadows in 2012, is clearly upbeat about his physical condition, even if he berated himself for a poor display against Raonic.\n""The first few matches back when I started playing singles last year I moved way worse than I did here, so that was positive,"" Murray said. ""The positives are that I got three matches in. Physically, I pulled up OK.""\nIt is one thing playing best-of-three sets and another taking on some of the game\'s young guns over best-of-five, the scenario he will face in New York next week.\nWhile Murray\'s footwork might not be what is once was, his court craft and sheer bloody-mindedness, not to mention his vast experience, will give him a puncher\'s chance of making a mark on what will be a slightly surreal, and probably unpredictable, fortnight in the first Grand Slam with no fans.\nThose wishing for a fairytale in New York might be asking a little too much though.\n""I don\'t see him winning another major in his career. I think it\'s just physically too demanding for everything he\'s been through,"" fellow Briton and former U.S. Open runner-up Greg Rusedski said this week.\n""For Andy, if he could get into the fourth round in the second week of a major it would be a phenomenal performance.\n""I think he\'s going to be in great spirits and really enjoy the U.S. Open. He\'s got great memories there.""\n(Reporting by Martyn Herman; Editing by Ken Ferris)\n', 'related_topics': ['     sports ', '     U.S. Open ', '     Grand Slam ']}"

Maybe the fact that we\'re now more in a difficult position in Europe helps everyone understand that we have to be stricter,"" Lappartient told reporters on Friday.\nThe new rules as well as the situation in France, however, have cast a shadow over the Tour.\n""You can’t say that there is no risk (that the race doesn’t reach Paris). I know everybody is aware that all of us have a responsibility to reach Paris,"" said Lappartient.\n""We cannot compromise with the rules. We have to stick to the plan.""\nRiders have been tested twice before the start of the race and a mobile laboratory provided by organisers will ensure they can be tested during the event.\nThe mobile lab is able to deliver a result within a couple of hours, meaning an initial positive test can be confirmed before the start of the following stage in order to avoid riders who receive \'false positives\' being sent home.\n(Reporting by Julien Pretot; Editing by Toby Davis)\n', 'related_topics': ['     sports ', '     Paris ', '     tour ']}"

There is still work to do but I\'m really happy and it\'s an exciting time to be an Arsenal player,"" Aubameyang told BT Sport after the match. It was the Gunners\' second trophy within a month following the side\'s FA Cup final win over Chelsea on Aug\xa01.\nThe game was a very even and at times rather slow affair, with Liverpool\'s Virgil Van Dijk having an early strike ruled out offside before Arsenal\'s opener, a well-worked move to break out of the champions\' high press.\nBukayo Saka took the ball up the field on the right, crossed all the way over to Aubameyang on the far left, and the Gabon striker skipped forward and curled an inch-perfect shot beyond the reach of Liverpool keeper Alisson into the opposite corner.\nThe Liverpool attack appeared disjointed by contrast. While they pushed Arsenal right back up the field for long stretches in the first half, they were unable to put together a single shot on goal.\nLiverpool\'s Japanese substitute Takumi Minamino levelled the tie in the 73rd minute with a shot from close range, picking up his first goal in 15 appearances since arriving on Merseyside in January.\n""If we\'d scored earlier that would have helped ...

""She is putting people first, being authentic, and she is leading.\xa0I love what Naomi and her generation of athletes are doing today.""\nThe stand of Osaka, who eventually won her semifinal Friday but had to drop out of the final with a hamstring injury on Saturday, prompted huge support throughout tennis and far beyond.\nIt all underscored the enormous influence that Osaka now wields, as a Black woman who competes for Japan, where she was born, but who spent most of her formative years in the U.S.\nIn May, she overtook her idol, Serena Williams, as the world\'s highest-earning female athlete, according to Forbes, all the while advocating against police brutality in the U.S.\n""I don\'t know what would have happened if Naomi Osaka wasn\'t in the semi-finals,"" former U.S. Open finalist Pam Shriver told Reuters.\n""She\'s led the way either with her racket or with her statements into a position of really good, modern-day leadership.""\nOsaka told reporters this week she wasn\'t sure ""if it\'s a light bulb or if there was any particular moment"" that prompted her to act, but said it has ""been building"" for some time.\n""I do believe she is going to be a future leader, I believe she is a present leader,"" James Blake, a former world number four who is now Tournament Director of the Miami Open, told Reuters.\n""She\'s the one that in my opinion that forced the hands of the ATP, WTA, USTA.""\nIn 2015 Blake, who is Black, was tackled without provocation or warning by a New York Police Department officer while on his way to the U.S. Open, in what the NYPD said was a case of mistaken identity.\n""Tennis now knows why Osaka was sitting out,"" he said.
