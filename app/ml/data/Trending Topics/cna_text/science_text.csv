      A made-in-Singapore solution to the world's plastic waste problem
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Imagine there’s a way to turn the plastic waste that ends up in oceans and landfills into a life-saving material, say, for making cheap fire-resistant jackets for all people.\nIt isn’t hard to do – at least, not any more – for a team of researchers in Singapore dreaming of reducing environmental waste and sharing their breakthrough with the world.\nThese scientists from the National University of Singapore and the Singapore Institute of Manufacturing Technology have converted polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles into a highly insulating and absorbent material called aerogel.\nAerogels, the lightest and most porous materials known to man, have existed since the 1930s – and were used to insulate the Mars Pathfinder rover in the 1990s.\nBut this is the first time an aerogel has been made from PET, the same plastic used for water and soft drink bottles.\nAnd with an estimated eight million tonnes of plastic waste entering the world’s oceans each year, there is no shortage of material that could be recycled into aerogel products instead.\nTheir possible real-life applications include: As a lining for fire-retardant coats and carbon dioxide absorption masks that could be used during a fire; better heat and sound insulation in buildings; and cleaning oil spills.\nNUS Associate Professor Hai Minh Duong, the co-leader of the research team, once used to wonder when he saw oil and plastic waste on the beach: “Can we use the rubbish on the beach to clean the oil spills?”\nFellow co-leader, Prof Nhan Phan-Thien, wanted to come up with a real product for everyone, after a lifetime of producing theories.\n“We want everyone to have a (fire-resistant) jacket. For example, we all live in high-rise buildings, and the first thing is safety. And if there’s a fire … everyone can be safe,” he cites.\nNow they have found a solution to these issues and more.\nBETTER THAN WHAT’S OUT THERE\nOver 95 per cent of an aerogel’s volume is made of air, hence the material’s high internal surface area and absorbent qualities.\nBased on the team’s experiments, when their aerogel is coated with certain water-repellent chemicals, it absorbs up to seven times more oil than existing commercial sorbents can – and at a faster rate.\nOwing to its insulating properties, it reduces sound more than any conventional insulation foam can, and insulates against heat many times better than fibreglass.\nWhen coated with flame retardants, it can withstand temperatures of up to 620 degrees Celsius – seven times more fireproof than the thermal lining in conventional fire-fighting suits, but at about 10 per cent of the weight.\nTo explain why aerogels are given different coatings, or surface modifications, Dr Duong uses the metaphor of a video game. “That’s like an expansion pack when you buy the game,” says the 44-year-old.\n“With the surface modification, you can get the wide range of applications, like if you coat the aerogels … with an amine chemical, they can absorb the toxic gases and carbon dioxide.”\nThe most common type of commercially available aerogel is silica aerogel, which he says sells for about S$40 per sheet (A4 size) and is used mainly in the aviation, car, gas and petroleum industries.\nBut his PET aerogel would cost about 50 cents to manufacture, with one recycled bottle producing one sheet.\nBesides devising a more environmentally-friendly and cost-effective aerogel, his team has also shortened the production process – which typically takes up to seven days – to about eight to 10 hours instead.\nIt is all about the recipe used for “cooking” the materials. And Dr Duong has another metaphor handy for a complex process that starts with rendering PET down into fibres: It is like the chemistry between two people.\n“It’s very similar to fibre and fibre. If you’d like (the bonding to be) strong and to hold, they need … the chemical reaction between them,” he says.\nAfter swelling up the fibres with water and then freeze-drying them, the result is “one of the most promising materials in the 21st century”.\nA SERIES OF WORLD’S FIRSTS\nThis is not the first time his team has created a new aerogel. Nearly three years ago, NUS announced their “world’s first” cellulose aerogel, made of paper waste.\nIn January, it was reported that the researchers had, in another pioneering development, turned unwanted cotton-based fabric into an even stronger aerogel.\nThe three aerogels have overlapping applications, although cellulose and cotton aerogels are more skin-friendly and thus could be used for personal care products like diapers, as well as in medical and battlefield settings, such as for rapid haemorrhage control.\nOf the three, the PET version is the strongest and has the fastest absorption capacity. But Dr Duong’s team is not done yet with recycling environmental waste into “amazing” engineering applications.\nIn future, they hope to do the same with rubber waste, for example from tyres, food waste like coffee grounds and soya bean pulp, and even metal or electric waste.\nPeople tend not to recycle now because they think waste cannot be more than low-value material, believes Dr Duong, who has been working at NUS for eight years.\n“As long as they know the value of the waste, (that) they can convert it into a very high value, (then) they’d recycle,” he says.\nBut for now, before his team can get the world to really sit up and take notice, they must commercialise the technology for mass production.\nThey recently published their PET aerogel research in the scientific journal Colloids and Surfaces A, and filed for a global patent.\nThey had earlier licensed the cellulose aerogel technology, through the NUS Industry Liaison Office, to materials and engineering company Bronxculture, based in Singapore.\nBut it may still take three to five years before any commercial product is in the market, reckon Dr Duong and Prof Phan-Thien, 65.\nEager for that to happen sooner, they are in the process of starting their own company to manage their cotton and PET aerogels.\nThe aim is to get it up and running by the end of next year, with some 20 companies worldwide interested in partnering them already.\nIt is an unusual step for university professors, but on Prof Phan-Thien’s part, he is “fascinated” by this project.\n“As an engineer, you need to focus on the products,” he says. “It’s good to lay your hand on something real, and this is it.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     environment ', '     science ', '     CNA Insider ']}"

The aim is to spark conversations around sustainability.\n""The idea of combining things together – in this case art and tech – has been something that motivates my work.""\nThis second edition follows\xa0last year’s inaugural event, and showcases the works of Singapore artists who participated in the Foundation’s artist incubation programme, Please Insert Human, which works in conjunction with the Foundation’s media studio arm, MeshMinds.\nWee’s A Better Tomorrow series of digital drawings for Meshminds 2.0 is an augmented reality (AR) experience celebrating SG75 – and the sustainable future Singapore can behold with positive individual and collective action.\nVisitors can use their smartphone cameras to scan QR codes and watch an animation of how the landscapes come to life with the adoption of greener practices through their mobile devices.\nIn another interactive exhibit, Wee uses the artificial intelligence (AI) engine Animaker to create Animaker Asia, a large-scale projection of an Asian jungle where visitors can use Duplo bricks to build endangered animal species found in Southeast Asia, such as the pangolin and orangutan.\nThe creations are then brought to life by AI-powered robots incorporating 3D scanning technology and an AI-powered search engine that understands 3D content.\nThis project is a partnership between The MeshMinds Foundation and The Tech Museum of Innovation in Silicon Valley, with support from the National Arts Council. Wee and Austria-based artist collective OMAi have been working together remotely to create a series of illustrations of Southeast Asia’s endangered animals to raise awareness of the need to protect them.\n“I grew up surrounded by technologies that were always getting more advanced, and was exposed to the world of video games and world building,” said Wee, who graduated with a bachelor’s degree in fine arts from the Rhode Island School of Design.\n“Without thinking of it as an art form where art and technology were actually coming together, I was making small and silly video game worlds and environments at a young age.”\nCELEBRATING FLUCTUATING IDENTITY AND \'IN-BETWEENESS\'\nArt and technology have always been part of Wee\'s life. His father was a computer engineer who enjoyed making dioramas, and his mother\xa0a piano teacher who loved to paint.\n""I try to keep working on my personal [projects] which don’t always have any other purpose save for enjoyment and curiosity.""\nThe self-described ""introverted and quiet kid” started dabbling in digital art when he enrolled as an Art Elective Programme student at Nanyang Junior College. He got his first break in 2012 as a freshman when he posted his first hybrid 2D and 3D tech-art piece, Forming And Fragmenting, online. It was quickly picked up and shared across blogs, Tumblr, and Facebook posts.\n\nWee started to receive commissions and his portfolio, which started with fine art prints, now include website design for marketing agency Goodstuph, a stop-motion social media post for Macallan’s Concept Number 1, and exhibitions at Apple and Mulan Gallery.\nBesides sustainability, themes of belonging and fitting in as he travelled between countries for education and work are alive in Wee’s works.\n\n“I\'ve been very fortunate to meet many people in our globalised world who identify with this \'fluctuating identity\', and who realise that instead of constantly trying to cater to each facet, there is a middle ground that we could create and be ourselves in. A lot of my personal work deals with this ‘in-betweenness’ and the idea of combining things together – in this case art and tech – has been something that motivates my work.”\nIn May, Wee will be participating in a two-week residency at The Tech Museum’s prototyping lab where he will take part in their year-round programme of exhibits, education programmes, and special events that inspire the next generation to use technology to tackle global challenges.\nIn the meantime, he continues to work on personal projects such as merging his MeshMinds 2.0 illustrations into a bigger isometric city.\n“Alongside professional projects, I try to keep working on my personal [projects] which don’t always have any other purpose save for enjoyment and curiosity and sometimes selfish personal achievement.

      Scientists find likely source of methane on Mars
  </h1>, 'text': 'PARIS: The mystery of methane on Mars may finally be solved as scientists Monday (Apr 1) confirmed the presence of the life-indicating gas on the Red Planet as well as where it might have come from.\nIn the 15 years since a European probe reported traces of the gas in the Martian atmosphere, debate has raged over the accuracy of the readings showing methane, which on Earth is produced by simple lifeforms.\nBecause methane gas dissipates relatively quickly - within around 12 years on Earth - and due to the difficulty of observing Mars\' atmosphere, many scientists questioned previous studies that relied on a single data set.\nNow an international team of experts have compared observations from two separate spacecraft, taken just one day apart in 2013, to find independent proof of methane on our neighbouring planet.\nFurthermore, they conducted two parallel experiments to determine the most likely source of methane on Mars to be an ice sheet east of Gale Crater - itself long assumed to be a dried up lake.\n""This is very exciting and largely unexpected,"" Marco Giuranna, from Rome\'s National Astrophysics Institute, told AFP.\n""Two completely independent lines of investigation pointed to the same general area of the most likely source for the methane.""\nEurope\'s Mars Express probe measured 15.5 parts per billion in the atmosphere above the Gale Crater on Jun\xa016, 2013. The presence of methane in the vicinity was confirmed by readings taken 24 hours earlier by NASA\'s Curiosity rover.\nUsing the data, Giuranna and the team divided the region around the crater into grids of 250 by 250 square kilometres.\nOne study then ran a million computer-modelled emissions scenarios for each section while another team studied images of the planet surface for features associated on Earth with the release of methane.\n""INDICATOR OF LIFE""\nThe most likely source was a sheet of frozen methane beneath a rock formation, which the team believes periodically ejects the gas into the atmosphere.\nGiuranna said that while methane is a sign of life on Earth, its presence on Mars doesn\'t necessarily constitute evidence of something similar on the Red Planet.\n""Methane is important because it could be an indicator of microbial life,"" he said. ""But life is not required to explain these detections because methane can be produced by abiotic processes.""\n""Though not a direct biosignature of life, methane can add to the habitability of martian settings, as certain types of microbes can use methane as a source of carbon and energy,"" he added.\nThough there is no liquid water on Mars, the European Space Agency said in February its imaging equipment had shown further evidence of dried up river beds, suggesting the Red Planet may once have been home to simple organisms.\nGiuranna said that further research was needed to determine the extent of the methane ice sheet near Gale Crater.\nIf founded to be extensive, the methane it contains ""could support a sustained human presence"" on Mars as a possible source of fuel for industrial processes and a propellant for returning manned missions to Earth, he said.\n', 'related_topics': ['     space ', '     science ']}"

      Making a dent: Japan probe prepares to blast asteroid
  </h1>, 'text': 'TOKYO:\xa0A Japanese probe began descending towards an asteroid on Thursday (Apr 4) on a mission to blast a crater into its surface and collect material that could shed light on the solar system\'s evolution.\nThe mission will be the latest in a series of explorations carried out by the Japanese space agency\'s Hayabusa2 probe and could reveal more about the origin of life on Earth.\nBut the task scheduled for Friday will be the riskiest yet of Hayabusa2\'s investigations, and involves the release of a device filled with explosives.\nThe so-called ""small carry-on impactor"", a cone-shaped device capped with a copper bottom, will emerge from Hayabusa2 on Friday, after the probe has arrived just 500 metres above the asteroid Ryugu.\nThe probe will then depart the area, and the impactor is programmed to explode 40 minutes later, propelling the copper bottom towards Ryugu, where it should gouge a crater into the surface of the asteroid that sits 300 million kilometres from Earth.\nHayabusa2 will move away from the area to avoid being damaged by debris from the explosion or the collision with Ryugu.\nAs it does so it will release a camera slightly above the site of the detonation that should be able to capture images of the event.\nThe camera should be able to transmit those images, but it is unclear when the first confirmation of the mission\'s success will come.\nIt will take two weeks for the probe itself to return to its ""home position"" near Ryugu after the detonation and impact.\n""We are thrilled to see what will happen when the impactor collides with the asteroid,"" Takashi Kubota, engineering researcher at the Japanese space agency (JAXA), told reporters earlier this week.\nThe crater could be as large as 10 metres in diameter if the surface is sandy, but a smaller three metres across if it is rocky, according to JAXA scientists.\n\'DRAGON PALACE\'\nNASA\'s Deep Impact project succeeded in creating an artificial crater on a comet in 2005, but only for observation purposes.\nThe aim of the crater on Ryugu is to throw up ""fresh"" material from under the asteroid\'s surface that could shed light on the early days of the solar system.\nIn February, Hayabusa2 touched down briefly on Ryugu and fired a bullet into the surface to puff up dust for collection, before blasting back to its holding position.\nThe asteroid is thought to contain relatively large amounts of organic matter and water from 4.6 billion years ago when the solar system was born.\nThe Hayabusa2 mission, with a price tag of around 30 billion yen ($270 million), was launched in December 2014 and is scheduled to return to Earth with its samples in 2020.\nPhotos of Ryugu - which means ""Dragon Palace"" in Japanese and refers to a castle at the bottom of the ocean in an ancient Japanese tale - show the asteroid has a rough surface full of boulders.\nHayabusa2 observes the surface of the asteroid with its camera and sensing equipment but has also dispatched two tiny MINERVA-II rover robots as well as the French-German robot MASCOT to help surface observation.\nAt about the size of a large fridge, Hayabusa2 is equipped with solar panels and is the successor to JAXA\'s first asteroid explorer, Hayabusa - Japanese for falcon.\nThat probe returned with dust samples from a smaller, potato-shaped asteroid in 2010, despite various setbacks during its epic seven-year odyssey and was hailed as a scientific triumph.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Japan ', '     space ', '     science ']}"

      Astronomers release first image of black hole
  </h1>, 'text': 'PARIS: Astronomers on Wednesday (Apr 10) unveiled the first image\xa0of a black hole, one of the star-devouring monsters scattered throughout the Universe and obscured by impenetrable shields of gravity.\nThe image of a dark core encircled by a flame-orange halo of white-hot gas and plasma looks like any number of artists\' renderings over the last 30 years.\nBut this time, it\'s the real deal.\nScientists have been puzzling over invisible ""dark stars"" since the 18th century, but never has one been spied by a telescope, much less photographed.\nThe supermassive black hole now immortalised by a far-flung network of radio telescopes is 50 million lightyears away in a galaxy known as M87.\n""It\'s a distance that we could have barely imagined,"" Frederic Gueth, an astronomer at France\'s National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) and co-author of studies detailing the findings, told AFP.\nMost speculation had centred on the other candidate targeted by the Event Horizon Telescope -\xa0Sagittarius A*, the black hole at the centre of our own galaxy, the Milky Way.\nBy comparison, Sag A* is only 26,000 lightyears from Earth.\nLocking down an image of M87\'s supermassive black hole at such distance is comparable to photographing a pebble on the Moon.\nEuropean Space Agency astrophysicist Paul McNamara called it an ""outstanding technical achievement"".\nIt was also a team effort.\n""Instead of constructing a giant telescope that would collapse under its own weight, we combined many observatories,"" Michael Bremer, an astronomer at the Institute for Millimetric Radio Astronomy (IRAM) in Grenoble, told AFP.\nEARTH IN A THIMBLE\nOver several days in April 2017, eight radio telescopes in Hawaii, Arizona, Spain, Mexico, Chile, and the South Pole zeroed in on Sag A* and M87.\nKnit together ""like fragments of a giant mirror,"" in Bremer\'s words, they formed a virtual observatory some 12,000 kilometres across - roughly the diameter of Earth.\nIn the end, M87 was more photogenic. Like a fidgety child, Sag A* was too ""active"" to capture a clear picture, the researchers said.\n""The telescope is not looking at the black hole per se, but the material it has captured,"" a luminous disk of white-hot gas and plasma known as an accretion disk, said McNamara, who was not part of the team.\n""The light from behind the black hole gets bent like a lens.""\nThe unprecedented image - so often imagined in science and science fiction - has been analysed in six studies co-authored by 200 experts from 60-odd institutions and published Wednesday in Astrophysical Journal Letters.\n""I never thought that I would see a real one in my lifetime,"" said CNRS astrophysicist Jean-Pierre Luminet, author in 1979 of the first digital simulation of a black hole.\nCoined in the mid-60s by American physicist John Archibald Wheeler, the term ""black hole"" refers to a point in space where matter is so compressed as to create a gravity field from which even light cannot escape.\nThe more mass, the bigger the hole.\nAt the same scale of compression, Earth would fit inside a thimble. The Sun would measure a mere six kilometres edge-to-edge.\nA successful outcome depended in part on the vagaries of weather during the April 2017 observation period.\n""For everything to work, we needed to have clear visibility at every [telescope] location worldwide"", said IRAM scientist Pablo Torne, recalling collective tension, fatigue and, finally, relief.\n\'HELL OF A CHRISTMAS PRESENT\'\nTorne was at the controls of the Pico Veleta telescope in Spain\'s Sierra Madre mountains.\nAfter that, is was eight months of nail-biting while scientists at MIT Haystack Observatory in Massachusetts and the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy in Bonn crunched the data.\nThe Universe is filled with electromagnetic ""noise"", and there was no guarantee M87\'s faint signals could be extracted from a mountain of data so voluminous it could not be delivered via the Internet.\nThere was at least one glitch.\n""We were desperately waiting for the data from the South Pole Telescope, which - due to extreme weather conditions during the southern hemisphere winter - didn\'t arrive until six months later,"" recalled Helger Rottmann from the Max Planck Institute.\nIt arrived, to be precise, on Dec\xa023, 2017.\n""When, a few hours later, we saw that everything was there, it was one hell of a Christmas present,"" Rottmann said.\nIt would take another year, however, to piece together the data into an image.\n""To be absolutely sure, we did the work four times with four different teams,"" said Gueth.\nEach team came up with exactly the same spectacular, history-making picture of a dark circle encased in a flaming-red halo.\n', 'related_topics': ['     science ']}"

The cells are currently able to contract, but do not yet have the ability to pump.\nThen they plan to transplant them into animal models, hopefully in about a year, said Dvir.\n""Maybe, in 10 years, there will be organ printers in the finest hospitals around the world, and these procedures will be conducted routinely,"" he said.\nBut he said hospitals would likely start with simpler organs than hearts.\nPRODUCING \'INK\'\nIn its statement announcing the research, Tel Aviv University called it a ""major medical breakthrough"".\nCardiovascular disease is the world\'s leading cause of death, according to the World Health Organization, and transplants are currently the only option available for patients in the worst cases.\nBut the number of donors is limited and many die while waiting.\nWhen they do benefit, they can fall victim to their bodies rejecting the transplant -- a problem the researchers are seeking to overcome.\nTheir research involved taking a biopsy of fatty tissue from patients that was used in the development of the ""ink"" for the 3D print.\nFirst, patient-specific cardiac patches were created followed by the entire heart, the statement said.\nUsing the patient\'s own tissue was important to eliminate the risk of an implant provoking an immune response and being rejected, Dvir said.\n""The biocompatibility of engineered materials is crucial to eliminating the risk of implant rejection, which jeopardises the success of such treatments,"" said Dvir.\nChallenges that remain include how to expand the cells to have enough tissue to recreate a human-sized heart, he said.\nCurrent 3D printers are also limited by the size of their resolution and another challenge will be figuring out how to print all small blood vessels.\nBut while the current 3D print was a primitive one and only the size of a rabbit\'s heart, ""larger human hearts require the same technology,"" said Dvir.\n3D printing has opened up possibilities in numerous fields, provoking both promise and controversy.\nThe technology has developed to include 3D prints of everything from homes to guns.\n', 'related_topics': ['     science ', '     Israel ']}"

      Remote island beach plastics point to greater waste problem
  </h1>, 'text': 'PARIS:\xa0The world may be seriously underestimating the amount of plastic waste along its coastlines, researchers said on Thursday (May 16) as they unveiled findings showing hundreds of millions of plastic fragments on a remote Indian Ocean archipelago.\nA team of experts travelled to the Cocos Islands, a group of 27 small atolls 2,100 kilometres (1,300 miles) west of Australia and found an estimated 414 million pieces of plastic.\nIn all, the plastic fragments would weigh around 238 tonnes, the team said.\nImages taken from the survey show white sand beaches blanketed with plastic waste.\nBut according to lead study author Jennifer Lavers, the fragments on the surface of Cocos Island beaches - and beaches around the world - may just be the tip of the iceberg.\n""I\'ve been working on remote islands as a marine biologist for 15 years or so and all of them have at least some debris, so I\'ve come to expect it,"" she told AFP.\n""One of the big surprises was that when I was digging down in the sediment to look at how much was buried and where, the quantity sometimes did not drop off with depth.""\nLavers and the team dug multiple holes across beaches on the Cocos Islands, and found plastics, mainly in the form of small or microparticles, throughout the sand layers.\nThey estimate that the true amount of plastic pollution on the beaches surveyed may be as much as 26 times greater than the fragments visible on the surface.\nThe study, published in the journal Nature Scientific Reports, concludes that global plastic waste surveys ""have drastically underestimated the scale of debris accumulation"".\n\'CHANGE ALL ASPECTS\'\nPlastic production has exploded worldwide in recent years, with half of all plastics produced in the last 13 years.\nMankind throws millions of tonnes of plastic into the sea every year, and much of it gets washed back ashore onto beaches where it poses a risk to wildlife.\nIt can also enter the food-chain in the form of microplastics, which have been found at all ocean depths and latitudes.\nLavers, from the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies at the University of Tasmania, said such plastic concentrations found on a remote group of islands was deeply concerning.\n""While the five oceanic gyres or \'garbage patches\' tend to garner a lot of research and media attention, the Cocos Islands are not located near or within one of these gyres,"" she said.\n""Plastic is everywhere, in all corners of the ocean, being distributed by current systems big and small.""\nSignificantly, the team estimated that as much as 25 per cent of the plastic items surveyed on Cocos were disposable or ""single-use"", such as food packaging, straws, forks and knives and toothbrushes.\nIn March nations failed to agree to a timetable to phase out all single-use plastics, opting instead to ""significantly reduce"" their production.\nLavers said industry- and society-wide changes in behaviour -\xa0from production, to consumption and re-use - were needed to stem the plastic waste epidemic.\n""Some islands have significant quantities to the point that it forces one to pause and consider all aspects of their life, from the simple items used each day (eg. to brush one\'s teeth) to how I communicate the outputs of my research,"" she said.\n""These islands change you.""\n', 'related_topics': ['     science ', '     pollution ', '     climate ', '     environment ']}"

      Commentary: The world is running out of sand
  </h1>, 'text': 'LONDON: It is no longer a cliche\xa0to say that the sands are shifting. They really are — by the lorryload.\xa0\nAccording to a UN report published last week, sand is being mined, dredged and even stolen to satisfy the global appetite for infrastructure. Strikingly, sand comes second only to water in terms of the volume of natural resources that are extracted and traded globally.\nWhile it is being poured into much-needed urban development, particularly in China and India, sand is not a limitless gift of nature. The world has a “sand budget” and we are spending it faster than it can be replenished.\nENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES\nThe environmental consequences are becoming plainer by the day. The plunder of lakes, rivers and coastal areas reduces biodiversity, destroys fishing communities, causes pollution, lowers the water table and, by ferrying away natural deposits, increases flood risk.\xa0\nIt can also threaten tourism in countries like Morocco: With illegal coastal extraction providing half of the country’s annual sand needs (10 million\xa0cubic metres), beaches are in danger of being stripped back to rock.\n“It is time to challenge the paradigm of infinite sand resources,” concludes the UN report.\xa0\nIt calls for improved governance on an issue that cuts across other sectors, such as mineral extraction, coastal management, water management and biodiversity.\xa0\nIt also urges international monitoring and understanding of how geological and hydrological forces move sand and gravel from one place to another — and so identify where material is being lost.\nUSED IN CONSTRUCTION AND\xa0DEVELOPMENT\nWe tend to think of sand as the powdery stuff that slips between the toes. In fact, it falls into two main classes.\xa0\nThe first is mineral sand, which contains such minerals as zircon and is used to make ceramics and pigments. It comes mainly from river beds and coastal areas like beaches. In inland and non-tropical coastal areas, sand is mostly made up of silica, or silicon dioxide.\nThe second class is aggregates, a generic term for crushed rock, sand and gravel. This easier-to-bind, coarse variety of “sand” is coveted by the construction industry.\xa0\nUp to 50 billion\xa0tonnes is removed from rivers, pits, quarries, coastlines and marine areas each year. Developing economies with rapidly growing infrastructure are voracious consumers of aggregates: China is home to more than 58 per cent of global cement production.\nIllegal or unregulated sand extraction flourishes in countries where, variously, rules are lacking, enforcement is lax or corruption thrives.\xa0\nDr John-Paul Latham\xa0of Imperial College London\xa0points out that\xa0because transporting sand is so expensive, the\xa0material is generally used near to its source. Tracking where infrastructure is springing up can yield clues about which ecosystems might be targeted.\n“There’s a huge incentive to get hold of the stuff by hook or by crook, and that can put a strain on nearby riverbeds and even flood plains,” Dr Latham explains.\xa0\nQuite subtle discussion needs to be had on how to reconcile that desperate demand for growth with the threat to local environments.\nThe great sand drain also presents a technical challenge, he says, to come up with alternative materials, perhaps using desert sand:\xa0\nIt is a huge resource that is already on land, so removing it is arguably less of an environmental problem. The concrete industry needs to look at this.\nAn Imperial student start-up, Finite, is trying to develop a building material out of smooth, fine-grained sand; the reusable, biodegradable composite is currently only suitable for temporary structures.\nSand is becoming a geopolitical irritant too. China’s territorial expansion in the South China Sea depends on imported aggregate. Sand is now the stuff of empire.\n', 'related_topics': ['     science ']}"

      Masters of manipulation: The evolution of 'puppy dog eyes'
  </h1>, 'text': 'WASHINGTON:\xa0Ever wondered how dogs learned to use their ""puppy eyes"" to bend us to their will?\nIt turns out our pet pooches have evolved human-like eyebrow muscles, which let them make the sad faces that melt our hearts, according to a new study published on Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).\nIt involved dissecting the cadavers of domestic dogs and comparing them to those of wild wolves, our best friends\' ancestors, whom they branched off from around 33,000 years ago (don\'t worry, no animals were killed for the research).\nA separate part of the study saw scientists videotaping two-minute interactions between dogs and a human stranger, then repeating the experiment with wolves, to closely track how much they used a specific muscle around the eye that produced an inner eyebrow raise.\nThe researchers found two muscles around the eye were routinely present and well formed in the domestic dogs, but not the wolves, and only dogs produced high-intensity eyebrow movements as they gazed at the human.\n""It makes the eye look larger, which is similar to human infants,"" Professor Anne Burrows of Duquesne University in Pittsburgh, who was one of the co-authors, told AFP. ""It triggers a nurturing response in people.""\nSince the muscles were robust in the dogs but not wolves, ""that tells us that that muscle and its function are selected,"" she added.\nThe current study was led by Juliane Kaminski at the University of Portsmouth and also included researchers from Howard University in Washington and North Carolina State University.\nIt builds on past work, including a notable 2015 paper by a group of researchers in Japan that demonstrated that gaze exchange between humans and their pet dogs led to a mutual spike in the so-called love hormone oxytocin, similar to an effect seen between human mothers and their babies.\nBut the latest work could explain how dogs are able to capture our attention in the first place.\nThe paper also posits two other explanations for what is going on - eyebrow movement may be significant for human-dog bonding ""not just because it might elicit a caring response, but also because it might play a role during dog-human communicative interactions.""\nHumans tend to pay attention to the upper facial areas of fellow humans during communication, and the dogs could be responding to this dynamic.\nA final hypothesis is that exaggerated eyebrow movements expose the white sclera of the dogs\' eyes, which humans also have and find appealing in other animals (other primates have darkened sclera to camouflage their gaze).\nANCIENT BREEDS VS TOY DOGS\nIntriguingly, a Siberian Husky that was dissected did not possess one of the two muscles that were present in other dog breeds, which pulls the corner of the eyelid toward the ears.\nThat may be because Huskies are an ancient dog breed, and the best living representative of what the link between dogs and wolves may have looked like.\nBurrows said the main limitation of the study was the small number of cadavers - four wild wolves and six domestic dogs -\xa0and that this is a potential avenue for future study.\n""We\'re also going to drill down into that interesting variation we saw in the Husky,"" she said. ""So we would like to take a look at additional ancient breeds like the Malamute, the Samoyed, and compare that to the toy companion breeds like the Chihuahua and the Yorkie.""\nThe work could also be extended to other animals humans have maintained close contact with, including horses, who appear to produce a similar movement, and cats.\n', 'related_topics': ['     science ', '     animals ']}"

When it finally arrived, the award ceremony had long passed.\nYi Rao, a prominent Chinese neurobiologist who had worked at Harvard and Northwestern universities in the past, said his application for a US visa to attend a workshop by the National Science Foundation was denied last July without an explanation.\nA State Department official said she could not discuss specific visa cases due to US privacy laws.\nThe State Department has said the increased scrutiny was prompted by rising number of students who were co-opted by foreign intelligence while in the United States.\nChina is by far the biggest source of international students and scholars on US campuses, with 360,000 attending last year.\n\'ATMOSPHERE OF SUSPICION\'\nThe cooling of ties is also complicating Beijing\'s efforts to recruit top Chinese and foreign talent, after US intelligence officials in December said the \'Thousand Talents\' programme facilitated the theft of American technology and intellectual property.\nTim Byrnes - an Australian physicist who won nearly one million yuan (US$144,000) from the programme in 2016 for a quantum computing lab at New York University\'s Shanghai campus - said he now finds himself in a ""precarious position"".\n""Possibly, some people awarded the Thousand Talents might not be able to apply for grants in the US in future due to fears of leaking intellectual property,"" Byrnes said.\nSince it was launched in 2008, the programme has attracted more than 7,000 Chinese and foreign researchers to China - mostly from the US - according to its website.\nBut Byrnes said he was not asked to share any of his findings with the Chinese government.\n""Everything we do is published in academic journals.

Using antibodies to attack cancer cells in the body is a form of cancer immunotherapy that harnesses the immune system to kill cancer cells.\nPRL3-zumab\xa0targets the PRL-3 protein, a tumour antigen that promotes cancer growth and is found in about 80 per cent of 11 common cancers the researchers examined.\nThis targeted treatment does not damage surrounding healthy cells that do not express PRL-3.\nProfessor Qi Zeng, research director at\xa0IMCB and lead researcher of the study, said: ""PRL3-zumab represents an innovative and disruptive approach to cancer therapy, as it is highly targeted to cancer cells and has less side effects compared to traditional cancer drugs.""\nTraditionally, chemotherapy\xa0targets cells that grow and divide quickly. This means that other than killing cancer cells, it can also affect other fast-growing healthy cells, like those of the hair, skin, intestines and bone marrow.\nThe IMCB research team first tested on animal models and found that the PRL-3 mouse antibody could suppress tumour growths that expressed the PRL-3 antigen in gastric, liver, lung, ovary, breast, acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and kidney cancers.\nThe team has also been testing the PRL3-zumab on human tumour samples since 2012 and results showed that the antibody can be used against a broad spectrum of\xa0common cancers, including those of the liver, lung, gastric, breast, colon and kidney.\nIn 2018, PRL3-zumab completed Phase 1\xa0clinical trials at the National University Cancer Institute and will soon be undergoing Phase 2 to test for efficacy and proof of concept of the therapy.\n', 'related_topics': ['     science ', '     cancer ', '     health ', '     A*Star ']}"

      Trio win medicine Nobel for work on how cells adapt to oxygen
  </h1>, 'text': 'STOCKHOLM: Three researchers from the United States and Britain on Monday (Oct 7) shared the Nobel Medicine Prize for research into how human cells sense and adapt to changing oxygen levels, opening up new strategies to fight such diseases as cancer and anaemia.\nAmericans William Kaelin and Gregg Semenza, and Britain\'s Peter Ratcliffe, split the nine million Swedish kronor (US$914,000) award.\nWhile the fact that humans need oxygen to survive has been understood for centuries, how the body registers and responds to oxygen was little known prior to the trio\'s pioneering work.\nSemenza studied a gene known as EPO which causes the body to create more red blood cells and isolated the specific DNA segments that help it to adapt to low oxygen levels.\nRatcliffe and Semenza then applied this knowledge to show that the oxygen sensing mechanism was present in virtually all human tissues.\nKaelin identified another gene, present in patients with a genetic disorder that puts them at far greater risk of certain cancers. The gene rewires the body\'s ability to prevent the onset of cancer, and it plays a key role in how cancer cells respond to low oxygen levels.\nTheir work has shed new light on the specific, cell-level processes the body undergoes when low on oxygen - from helping our muscles function during exercise to adapting to life at high altitude.\nCells\' oxygen-sensing ability is also essential during foetal development and in creating new blood vessels.\nDRUGS BEING DEVELOPED\nA large number of diseases are linked to EPO, including renal failure and severe anaemia.\nCancerous tumours use the body\'s oxygen-regulating tools to hijack blood vessel formation and allow the cancer cells to spread. The Nobel committee said on Monday that several trials were underway developing drugs to interrupt this process, potentially short-circuiting tumour growth.\nFor treatment of anaemia -\xa0where the body lacks sufficient red blood cells to carry enough oxygen to tissues -\xa0medicines seek to stimulate EPO creation. One such drug has already been approved in China.\nThis essentially tricks the body into thinking it is at higher altitude, prompting the creation of new red blood cells.\nKaelin, 61, works at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston and is a professor at Harvard Medical School in the United States.\nSemenza, 63, is director of the Vascular Research Program at the Johns Hopkins Institute for Cell Engineering.\nRatcliffe, 65, is director of clinical research at the Francis Crick Institute in London, and director of the Target Discovery Institute in Oxford.\nKaelin told reporters it was a moment he had dreamt of for a long time. ""I think any scientist who says he\'s never or she\'s never considered this moment is probably lying,"" he said.\nWhen the phone rang at around 5.00am, he wasn\'t sure if he was dreaming.\nHe then noticed the caller ID was from Europe, ""And at that point my heart started racing,"" the 61-year-old told AFP.\n""I sort of had this out-of-body feeling of just great appreciation,"" he said, adding he was accepting the prize partly on behalf of his late wife Carolyn, a cancer surgeon.\nSemenza on the other hand missed the first call he got, and waited several anxious minutes by the phone, answering it second time around.\n""I was in a daze,"" he said, adding he had not been expecting the honor but had since celebrated with champagne.\nDISCOVERY SCIENCE\nKaelin said the win highlighted the value of basic research, rather than setting out to cure a specific disease.\n""Here I am as a cancer biologist helping to contribute to a new drug for haematological condition, namely anaemia,"" he told AFP.\nSemenza, whose first breakthrough came in 1995, told AFP that the Nobel prize created the false impression that great science was done by older people, when the opposite was in fact true.\n""We made the discoveries when we were young, but we get recognised when we\'re old,"" he said, adding it was younger scientists at his lab driving cutting-edge work.\nThe Peace Prize will be awarded in Oslo on Friday, with speculation rife that Swedish teenage activist Greta Thunberg could win for her campaign to raise awareness about climate change.\nBefore that, the Physics Prize will be announced on Tuesday and the Chemistry Prize on Wednesday.\nOn Thursday, the Swedish Academy will announce one literature laureate for 2018 and one for 2019, after postponing last year\'s award due to a sexual harassment scandal that exposed deep rifts among its 18 members.\nThe announcement of the Economics Prize will wrap things up on Monday, Oct\xa014.\n', 'related_topics': ['     technology ', '     science ']}"

(and) can also store significant amounts of energy from solar and wind power, making possible a fossil fuel-free society,"" the jury said.\n""Lithium batteries have revolutionised our lives since they first entered the market in 1991,"" it said, adding they were ""of the greatest benefit to humankind"".\nSeeking an alternative source of power during the oil crisis of the 1970s, Whittingham discovered a way to harness the potential energy in lithium, a metal so light it floats on water.\nHe constructed a battery partly made of lithium that utilised the element\'s natural tendency to shed electrons, thereby transferring energy.\nHowever the battery was too unstable to be used.\nGoodenough built on Whittingham\'s prototype, substituting a different metal compound and doubling the potential energy of the battery to four volts.\nThis paved the way for far more powerful and durable batteries in the future.\nIn 1985, Yoshino instead used a carbon-based material that stores lithium ions, finally rendering the battery commercially viable.\nThe culmination of the trio\'s research resulted in the most powerful, lightweight and rechargeable battery ever seen.\nWhen asked what type of researcher he is, Yoshino told a Tokyo press conference that a good scientist needed two qualities.\n""One thing is that you have to have a flexible brain. Flexibility. The other is tenacity. You stay persistent and never give up,"" he said.\nWhittingham, 77, said he was ""overcome with gratitude at receiving this award"".\nHis research ""has helped advance how we store and use energy at a foundational level, and it is my hope that this recognition will help to shine a much-needed light on the (US) nation\'s energy future,"" he said on the website of Binghamton University in New York where he is a professor.\nYoshino, 71, works at the Asahi Kasei Corporation in Tokyo and is a professor at Meijo University in Nagoya, Japan, while Goodenough holds the Cockrell Chair in Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin.\nWhittingham, 77, is a professor at the Binghamton University, State University of New York.\nThe trio will receive the prize from King Carl XVI Gustaf at a formal ceremony in Stockholm on Dec\xa010, the anniversary of the 1896 death of scientist Alfred Nobel who created the prizes in his last will and testament.\nLast year, the honour went to US scientists Frances Arnold and George Smith and British researcher Gregory Winter for developing enzymes used for greener and safer chemistry and antibody drugs with less side effects.\nArnold was just the fifth woman to clinch chemistry\'s most prestigious honour since Marie Curie was honoured in 1911.\nThis year\'s Nobel prize season kicked off on Monday with the Medicine Prize awarded to Americans William Kaelin and Gregg Semenza, and Britain\'s Peter Ratcliffe.\nPEACE PRIZE ON FRIDAY\nThey won for research into how human cells sense and adapt to changing oxygen levels, opening up new strategies to fight such diseases as cancer and anaemia.\nOn Tuesday, the Physics Prize honoured Canadian-American cosmologist James Peebles and Swiss astronomers Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz for research on how the Universe evolved after the Big Bang, and the first discovery of a planet outside our solar system, known as an exoplanet.\nThe Literature Prize will follow on Thursday, with two laureates to be crowned after a sexual harassment scandal forced the Swedish Academy to postpone the 2018 award, for the first time in 70 years.\nSome names creating a buzz ahead of this year\'s literature prize are Canadian poet Anne Carson, Kenyan writer Ngugi Wa Thiong\'o, Romanian poet and novelist Mircea Cartarescu and Polish writer and activist Olga Tokarczuk.\nOn Friday the action moves to Norway where the Peace Prize is awarded, with bookies predicting a win for Swedish teen climate activist Greta Thunberg on betting sites such as Ladbrokes.\nThe Economics Prize will wrap up the Nobel prize season on Monday, Oct\xa014.\n', 'related_topics': ['     science ']}"

      The 'supercells' that cured an infant's grave genetic illness
  </h1>, 'text': 'MCLEAN, Virginia: When a person\'s immune system is impaired by a genetic disease, a bone-marrow transplant can be a powerful therapeutic tool, but with a major downside: during the first few months the recipient\'s defenses against viruses are severely weakened. The slightest infection can lead to a hospital trip.\nA still-experimental type of treatment known as T-cell therapy aims to assist during this vulnerable period - the months during which the body is rebuilding its natural defenses. After two decades of clinical trials, the technology has been refined, and is being used to treat more and more patients, many of them children.\nA boy named Johan is one of them.\nToday he is a mischievous, smiling toddler with a thick shock of light-brown hair, who never tires, playfully tormenting the family\'s puppy, Henry.\nThere is no sign of the three-year-long medical and emotional roller-coaster ride he and his family, who live in an affluent Washington suburb, have been on.\nThe first traumatic surprise came with the results of a pregnancy test: Johan was not planned.\n""That was a huge shock. I cried,"" said his mother, 39-year-old Maren Chamorro.\nRISKY PROCEDURE\nShe had known since childhood that she carried a gene that can be fatal in a child\'s first 10 years, chronic granulomatous disease (CGD).\nHer brother died of it at the age of seven. The inexorable laws of genetics meant that Maren had a one in four chance of transmitting it to her child.\nFor their first children, she and her husband Ricardo had chosen in-vitro fertilisation, allowing the embryos to be genetically tested before implantation.\nTheir twins Thomas and Joanna were born -\xa0both disease-free - seven and a half years ago.\nBut in Johan\'s case, a post-birth genetic test quickly confirmed the worst: he had CGD.\nAfter conferring with experts at Children\'s National Hospital in Washington, the couple took one of the most important decisions of their lives: Johan would receive a bone-marrow transplant, a risky procedure but one that would give him a chance of a cure.\n""Obviously, the fact that Maren had lost a sibling at a young age from the disease played a big role,"" Ricardo confided.\nBone marrow, the spongy tissue inside bones, serves as the body\'s ""factory"" for the production of blood cells - both red and white.\nHIS BROTHER\'S IMMUNE SYSTEM\nJohan\'s white blood cells were incapable of fighting off bacteria and fungal infections. A simple bacterial infection, of negligible concern in a healthy child, could spread out of control in his young body.\nLuckily, Johan\'s brother Thomas, six years old at the time, was a perfect match. In April 2018, doctors first ""cleansed"" Johan\'s marrow using chemotherapy. They then took a small amount of marrow from Thomas\'s hip bones using a long, thin needle.\nFrom that sample they extracted ""supercells,"" as Thomas calls them - stem cells, which they reinjected into Johan\'s veins. Those cells would eventually settle in his bone marrow -\xa0and begin producing normal white blood cells.\nThe second step was preventive cell therapy, under an experimental program led by immunologist Michael Keller at Children\'s National Hospital.\nThe part of the immune system that protects against bacteria can be rebuilt in only a matter of weeks; but for viruses, the natural process takes at least three months.\nHURDLES REMAIN\nFrom Thomas\'s blood, doctors extracted specialised white blood cells - T-cells -\xa0that had already encountered six viruses.\nKeller grew them for 10 days in an incubator, creating an army of hundreds of millions of those specialized T-cells. The result: a fluffy white substance contained in a small glass vial.\nThose T-cells were then injected into Johan\'s veins, immediately conferring protection against the six viruses.\n""He has his brother\'s immune system,"" said Keller, an assistant professor at Children\'s National.\nJohan\'s mother confirmed as much: today, when Thomas and Johan catch a cold, they have the same symptoms, and for nearly the same amount of time.\n""I think it\'s pretty cool to have immunity from your big brother,"" Maren Chamorro said.\nThis therapeutic approach - boosting the body\'s immune system using cells from a donor or one\'s own genetically modified cells -\xa0is known as immunotherapy.\nIts main use so far has been against cancer, but Keller hopes it will soon become available against viruses for patients, like Johan, who suffer from depressed immune systems.\nThe chief obstacles to that happening are the complexity of the process and the costs, which can run to many thousands of dollars. These factors currently restrict the procedure to some 30 medical centers in the United States.\nFor Johan, a year and a half after his bone marrow transplant, everything points to a complete success.\n""It\'s neat to see him processing things, and especially play outside in the mud,"" his mother said.\n""You know, what a gift!""\nHer only concern now is the same as any mother would have - that when her son does fall ill, others in the family might catch the same bug.\n', 'related_topics': ['     science ', '     health ', '     US ']}"

      Commentary: When it comes to coronavirus, men are more vulnerable
  </h1>, 'text': 'LONDON: The details of the 99 coronavirus patients admitted to a Wuhan hospital were written up, as protocol demands, without fanfare. “The average age of the patients was 55.5 years, including 67 men and 32 women,” said a Lancet paper published last month, which reported 11 deaths.\nIt is an eye-catching discrepancy. A picture is emerging of 2019-nCoV as a novel pathogen that disproportionately affects older men, particularly those with existing illnesses such as heart disease and diabetes.\nA similar pattern can be found in the statistics on SARS, which caused about 780 deaths nearly two decades ago.\nSome scientists are now convinced that these sex differences in clinical data reflect a genuine male vulnerability to coronaviruses, rather than a bias in exposure. The observations add to growing evidence that, immunologically speaking, men are the weaker sex.\nGENDER MATTERS\nThe new coronavirus is most often compared with SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which originated on the Arabian peninsula in 2012.\nSARS had an overall death rate of about 10 per cent, while MERS killed about a third of those infected. The figure for 2019-nCoV seems to be about 3 to 4 per cent (that might fall as milder cases turn up).\nDrilling down into the data, though, reveals that gender matters.\nOne analysis of about 1,800 SARS patients showed a death rate for men of 22 per cent, compared with 13 per cent for women. A 2019 study of 229 MERS patients showed it killed 32 per cent of men compared with 26 per cent of women.\nPossible reasons for disparities include smoking, variation in hospital treatment, and gender-linked immune response.\nThat last possibility preoccupies Stanley Perlman, an immunologist at the University of Iowa, who has studied how SARS progresses in male and female mice.\nMiddle-aged male mice fared particularly poorly.\nThe sex differences, he said, “seem to be consistent across coronaviruses. The effects are greater in mice than humans, I think, but there is always a male gender predominance.”\nHe and colleagues suggest hormones – specifically oestrogen – might be key. And the size of the Wuhan outbreak, he suggests, could allow oestrogen’s role in disease defence to be teased out.\nOUT OF THE WOMB\nSex differences in immune function appear to start right out of the womb. Baby girls are more likely to reach their first birthday than male newborns, according to the World Health Organization.\nGlobally, women outlive men by an average of six to eight years. The WHO credits female longevity to an “inherent biological advantage”, as well as to healthier behaviour.\nFemales are also more prone to autoimmune diseases, such as lupus, in which the body attacks itself. This might be because women carry two X chromosomes (the X chromosome contains immunity-related genes, among others).\nFrom an evolutionary point of view, an easily triggered immune response might be connected to childbearing; one theory is that while some parts of the female immune system are dialled down to avoid rejecting the foetus, other parts step up to compensate.\nGiven that modern women spend less time pregnant than their forebears did, this selectively exaggerated response might explain the high female levels of autoimmune diseases. That same overactive response might mean women clear the new coronavirus more quickly than men.\nThere is no upside to the current outbreak; a new chain of transmission has begun in Europe after a suspected “superspreader” travelled from a Singapore conference to a French ski resort, infecting others.\nStill, rapidly growing patient numbers might yet reveal the secrets of female resistance.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Wuhan virus ', '     science ', '     health ']}"

That would make it not only capable of causing severe pneumonia, but of spreading easily like flu or the common cold.\nResearchers in Guangdong province monitored the amount of coronavirus in the 18 patients. One of them, who had moderate levels of the virus in their nose and throat, never had any disease symptoms.\nAmong the 17 symptomatic patients, the team found levels of the virus increased soon after symptoms first appeared, with higher amounts of virus present in the nose than in the throats, a pattern more similar to influenza than SARS.\nThe level of virus in the asymptomatic patient was similar to what was present in patients with symptoms, such as fever.\n""What this says is clearly this virus can be shed out of the upper respiratory tract and that people are shedding it asymptomatically,"" Poland said.\nThe findings add to evidence that this new virus, though genetically similar, is not behaving like SARS, said Kristian Andersen, an immunologist at Scripps Research in La Jolla who uses gene sequencing tools to track disease outbreaks.\n""This virus is clearly much more capable of spreading between humans than any other novel coronavirus we\'ve ever seen. This is more akin to the spread of flu,"" said Andersen, who was not involved with the study.\nThe researchers said their findings add to reports that the virus can be transmitted early in the course of the infection, and suggest that controlling the virus will require an approach different from what worked with SARS, which primarily involved controlling its spread in a hospital setting.\xa0\nDownload our app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram\n', 'related_topics': ['     COVID-19 ', '     Wuhan virus ', '     health ', '     science ']}"

They placed the gene sequence in GenBank, an open-access data repository.\nResearchers around the world immediately started analysing it to develop diagnostics.\nAs of Feb 19, 81 different coronavirus gene sequences had been shared openly via GenBank and 189 via the China National Genomics Data Centre. They provide the data that will allow scientists to decode the mystery of the virus and hopefully find a treatment or vaccine.\nThe WHO and national organisations like the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention also publish open statistical data, such as the number of patients. This can help researchers to map the spread of the virus and offer the public up-to-date and transparent information.\nOPEN PUBLICATIONS\nScience publications are costly. One of the most expensive Elsevier journals, Tetrahedron Letters, costs £16,382 (US$21,200) for an institutional annual subscription and £673 for a personal one.\nEven the University of Harvard cannot afford to subscribe to all journals. This means not all researchers have access to all subscription-based publications.\nAuthors can publish their articles free to access, which often means they need to pay the publishers an average £2,000 in article processing costs.\nIn 2018, only 36.2 per cent of science publications were open-access.\nAs of Feb\xa018,\xa0there were 500 scientific articles about the novel coronavirus in the comprehensive scholarly database Dimensions. Only 160 (32 per cent) of them were in open-access publications. This includes preprint servers such as bioRxiv and arXiv, which are widely used open-access archives to publish research before it goes through scientific peer review.\nNormally, you would need to pay subscription fees to read any of the other 340 articles. However, articles published by the 100 companies who have signed the Wellcome Trust’s statement on sharing coronavirus research have been made freely accessible by publishers.\nMajor publishers including Elsevier, Springer Nature, Wiley Online Library, Emerald, Oxford University Press and Wanfang have also set up featured open-access resources page. The Chinese database CQVIP has offered free access to all of its 14,000 journals during the coronavirus outbreak.\nAs it takes on average 160 days for a preprint to be published after peer review, sharing preprints can save time and lives. Free access to articles on the coronavirus can also accelerate global research on this subject.\nOPEN EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES\nDue to the outbreak, universities in China have postponed their new semesters and switched to online learning.\nBut alongside the 24,000 online courses open to students, universities (including the elite Peking University, Tsinghua University and Xi’an Jiaotong University) are offering free online courses to the public about the coronavirus.\nSuch courses can offer the public reliable information grounded in academic research, helping them better understand and protect themselves against the virus.\nRESPONSIBLE OPEN SCIENCE\nWhile all these developments are positive, it is important to remember that open science doesn’t mean science without limits. It must be used responsibly by researchers and the public.\nTo start, researchers need to have mutual respect for the integrity of their work. For example, there have reportedly been disagreements over whether scientists need to request consent to reuse pre-publication data from shared coronavirus gene sequencing.\nAssuming researchers act in good faith and not to simply further their own careers, it is still important for them to clarify the conditions with which they make their research available, and to carefully check and follow such conditions when using other people’s data.\nResponsible uses of pre-publication data are vital to fostering a scientific culture that encourages transparent and explicit cooperation.\nThere are also issues with making research available without peer review – as happens with preprint servers – as misinterpretations and mistakes can easily happen.\nOne paper posted on bioRxiv on Feb 2, 2020 claimed to show “insertions” in the coronavirus’s DNA that showed an “uncanny similarity” to regions found in HIV DNA.\nAfter criticism of their work, the paper’s authors withdrew it stating they did not intend to “feed into the conspiracy theories” that the novel coronavirus had been deliberately engineered. Such conspiracy theories were recently condemned by 27 scientists from eight countries in their open statement to the leading medical journal The Lancet.\nYet until Feb\xa019, the withdrawn paper was the most discussed study in the world in online news and social media, according to the academic ranking site Altmetric. The paper may have been withdrawn but it may not be forgotten.\nOpen science is vital to tackling the world’s big challenges. But when information can be misused, skewed or misinterpreted at global level so quickly, we also need scientists and the public to treat open science with great care and responsibility.\nXin Xu is an ESRC Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Centre for Global Higher Education at the University of Oxford.

      Commentary: Science goes viral, thanks to COVID-19. But there are roadblocks along the way
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Unless you own shares in Zoom or Netflix, it’s hard to see even the faintest silver lining to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\xa0\nThere have been a staggering 60,000 deaths worldwide, the global economy has ground to a halt and everyday life has been profoundly altered.\nBut as a science communicator there has been at least one positive effect of COVID-19, the first of which is an unprecedented interest in science.\nA FINE DAY FOR SCIENCE\nUp until this point, it seemed as though fighting scientific misinformation was a fool’s errand, a brave but ultimately futile quest against trolls and well-meaning relatives alike. I had long given up telling people that drinking lemon water in the morning probably does nothing to ‘boost’ their immunity, only speaking up if the things they wanted to try actually sounded dangerous.\nBut all of a sudden, my social media feeds were filled with science: infographics about how SARS-CoV-2 spreads and charts explaining the difference between linear versus exponential growth; even links to primary research papers.\nAs someone whose professional goal is making scientific research accessible to a wider audience, I was heartened to see this surge of information rising up to displace rumours about COVID-19 and how it spreads.\xa0\nMany international news organisations have put out visually-appealing and interactive infographics to help readers understand the rapidly evolving outbreak.\nOther publications, such as the online science magazine Undark, have held COVID-19-related Ask Me Anything sessions, while the World Health Organization launched its first TikTok campaign.\nFor our part at Asian Scientist Magazine, in addition to our regular coverage of scientific research across Asia, we have started a series called #stopcovidiots to share bite-sized facts about COVID-19 specifically.\xa0\nSince February, COVID-19 related articles have boosted traffic on our site by 40 per cent, reflecting the hunger for more scientifically-backed information.\nSPEED AND THE SEARCH FOR TRUTH\nScientists have been working at a frenetic pace to answer some of the most pressing questions about the novel coronavirus: is it mutating? What does it bind to? Can existing drugs be used to stop it? But the speed with which everyone is jumping on the bandwagon also adds to the complexity of understanding the issue at hand.\nSearching ‘COVID-19’ on the medical search engine PubMed turns up no less than 2,500 research papers, all of them published in just the last two months.\nIn fact, so many papers on COVID-19 have been published in journals and released as pre-prints that researchers have built a 29,000 paper-strong database so that artificial intelligence can help them make sense of it.\xa0\nEven experts are struggling to drink from the firehose of COVID-19 research being pushed out at the moment.\nAnother issue with speed is that it short circuits the process of peer review, which, for all its flaws, attempts to prevent weak research from entering the scientific literature.\nSharing information as quickly as possible is crucial to containing the virus, but ensuring that the information is accurate is even more important than ever, as taking personal and policy decisions based on faulty information can have dire consequences.\nWhen a research group in India put out a pre-print suggesting that the similarities between SARS-CoV-2 and HIV were “uncanny,” it sparked panic and was shared thousands of times before being retracted.\nIt turns out that the similarities the team—not virologists but experts in protein biology—had noticed are actually found in many other viruses, and do not in themselves suggest anything particularly dangerous about SARS-CoV-2.\nIn other cases, sample sizes are small and patient populations unique, making the findings difficult to generalise. Because of this, reports often contradict each other, turning evidence-based decision-making even more challenging.\nMy worry as a science communicator is that this apparent conflict might erode the public’s trust in science, when in fact scientists know that this seeming lack of consensus is a feature and not a bug in the scientific process.\nThis is precisely how science is supposed to work; we test different hypotheses and reach conclusions full of caveats that are not truth itself but approximations of the truth. Unfortunately, this is not the certainty that most people are looking for.\nSo while it is great that people are sharing research articles on WhatsApp, all information needs to be evaluated critically, no matter how ‘scientific’ or ‘official’ it looks.\nA good place to start would be to understand the distinction between a peer-reviewed article and a pre-print, and secondly to consider whether the expertise of the research group is relevant to the topic at hand.\nJust as you wouldn’t trust your accountant to do your plumbing, discipline matters when it comes to whether or not to trust an authority figure.\nTHE LONG GAME: TRUST\nWhile the increased interest in scientific papers from the general public is welcomed, there is still a need for contextualisation and analysis of the research findings. This is a job for science communicators like myself, who try to explain the implications of research to the public but also highlight the limitations as well.\nWhile we are working hard right now—digesting the information being put out, conducting interviews with experts and writing up articles about COVID-19 - our work will continue even when the virus is eventually contained and the spike in interest dies down.\nThat is because our long-term goal is to build two-way trust between science and the public: for scientists to trust that lay people will not misunderstand their work and for the public to trust the integrity of the scientific process and research.\nIn a 2015 survey of nearly 1,000 Singaporeans, we found that while most people agreed that science was important and relevant to their everyday life, the level of scientific literacy was uneven, with many still being confused, for example, about the inability of antibiotics to treat viral infections.\nWhat COVID-19 has showed me, however, is that people can grasp scientific concepts very readily—when motivated to do so.\nTo my amazement, terms like “basic reproduction number” and “epidemiology” have now become part of everyday parlance. The hope is that as readers expose themselves to more science news, they become more comfortable with it and better able to discern which sources are reliable.\nAs more people turn to science for answers, I hope that trust in scientists will be deepened and that scientifically-backed policy advice will be heeded. It is our only hope.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\nDr Rebecca Tan is the editor-in-chief of Asian Scientist Magazine. \n', 'related_topics': ['     science ', '     COVID-19 ']}"

      Commentary: Can you catch the coronavirus twice?
  </h1>, 'text': 'CANBERRA: Governments are starting to lift restrictions and some are considering “immunity passports”, where all restrictions are lifted for those previously infected.\nBut are you immune from COVID-19 if you’ve already been infected?\nSome infections never recur once you’ve had them, such as measles and smallpox. But you can get plenty of others again, such as influenza and tetanus.\nSo far, research suggests at least a proportion of people who have had COVID-19 will be protected from another infection – at least initially. But the science is far from certain.\nCORONAVIRUS AND ANTIBODIES\nWhen we encounter an infection for the first time, our body needs to respond quickly to the threat. So within hours, it activates our innate immune system. This system is quick-acting but isn’t targeted to the specific threat.\nThe innate immune system’s attack distracts the infection while the body produces a more targeted but slower response against the infection, via the adaptive immune system.\nThe adaptive immune system produces antibodies to fight the infection. These are what we measure in the blood when trying to determine who has been exposed to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.\nThe body produces different types of antibodies to respond to different parts of the virus. But only some have the ability to stop the virus entering cells. These are called “neutralising antibodies”.\nAccording to the World Health Organization, people who recover from COVID-19 develop antibodies in their blood. But some people appear to have low levels of neutralising antibodies.\nTo see if an antibody is a neutralising antibody, you need to do special laboratory tests to see the effect of the antibody in cells exposed to the virus.\nBut even if an antibody blood test could confirm neutralising antibodies, it doesn’t automatically mean the person is immune from further infection. Even though the antibody is present, for example, the quantities may be insufficient to work.\nSo a positive antibody blood test to COVID-19 doesn’t confirm if someone is immune to COVID-19 or not. It only tells us if a person has ever been exposed to COVID-19 – and even that depends on how sensitive and specific the antibody test is.\nThere are reports from different countries of people hospitalised with COVID-19 who tested negative when they were discharged, before testing positive again.\nHowever, a study from China found those who retested positive didn’t get any sicker. This suggests these people were intermittently shedding the virus and were at the tail end of their original illness, rather than getting a new COVID-19 infection.\nThe nasal and throat swab test being used to detect the virus also can’t say whether the virus is alive or not; therefore, they could have just been shedding dead virus. This could explain why their close contacts didn’t become sick or test positive.\nIMMUNITY AGAINST OTHER CORONAVIRUSES\nFour other types of human coronaviruses (HCoVs) – 229E, NL63, OC43 and HKU1 – cause about 15 to 30 per cent of the common colds worldwide. Two of these – OC43 and HKU1 – are a subgroup of coronaviruses known as betacoronaviruses, as are SARS-CoV, MERS and SARS-CoV-2.\nA study from 1990 found infection with human coronavirus 229E generated protective immunity from that particular virus.\nBut one year later, as antibody levels declined, these people could be reinfected. The researchers hypothesised a cyclic pattern of infection, with people getting coronavirus infections every two to three years.\nMore recently, when researchers examined 128 samples from people who had recovered from SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), they found 90 per cent had strong neutralising antibodies, while 50 per cent had positive T-cell responses, meaning they were likely to be immune.\nGiven this information about other coronaviruses, it’s likely that infection with SARS-CoV-2 provides some immunity from a second infection. But whether everyone becomes immune, and the duration of that immunity, are unknown.\nTHE MYSTERY OF CROSS-IMUNITY\nThere is debate if other coronaviruses provide cross-immunity against COVID-19. Cross-immunity is where immunity against one infection provides protection from another infection.\nIn one study, researchers tracked newborns up to 20 months of age. They found that infection with human coronavirus OC43 generated neutralising antibodies that may have protected against HKU1.\xa0\nIn other words, it led to cross-immunity.\nIf there is cross-immunity between HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1, which are both beta-coronaviruses, it’s possible they could generate cross-immunity with the new betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2.\nBut unfortunately, the current tests for COVID-19 (nasal and throat swabs, and blood tests) can’t give us information about cross-immunity.\nCross-immunity with the other two betacoronaviruses could partly explain some of the inconsistencies we see with COVID-19.\nFor example, why do some people under 50 years of age experience severe and even fatal illness with COVID-19, while others over 100 years old fully recover?\nGiven that immunity to these two other betacoronaviruses is widespread and probably fluctuates over time, people with COVID-19 may have had different antibody levels against HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 when they were infected with SARS-CoV-2.\nThis could have contributed to differing levels of severity of COVID-19 infection.\nIt’s even possible that the presence of cross-immunity could have been harmful rather than protective, because it might lead to an over-exuberant immune response. This phenomenon can be seen in dengue, another viral infection.\nOver time, the issue of immunity to COVID-19 will be resolved. But for now, scientists are still piecing the information together.\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\nSanjaya Senanayake is Associate Professor of Medicine, Infectious Diseases Physician at the Australian National University.

      New COVID-19 test developed in Singapore detects past infection within an hour
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: A new COVID-19 test that can rapidly assess if a person has been previously\xa0infected with the coronavirus is now available to hospitals\xa0in Singapore.\nLaunched on\xa0Friday (May 15), the\xa0cPass serology test detects antibodies - formed by the body to fight off infections -\xa0in the blood or serum of patients.\nIt is not used to check for active infection. Its main purpose rather, is for contact tracing, detecting asymptomatic cases and assessing\xa0herd immunity. Such serological tests have been used in Singapore for contact tracing.\xa0\nWhat is different about the new test developed by Singapore’s Duke-NUS Medical School is that it produces results in just an hour instead of days, a world\xa0first.\xa0\nThe test looks for the presence of\xa0neutralising antibodies, which are those that can\xa0block\xa0the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19.\nIn other words, an indicator of immunity against the virus.\n“In most cases, neutralising antibodies equal protection or (is the) best indicator of protection,” said Professor Wong Linfa, director of the Duke-NUS’ Emerging Infectious Diseases programme and the principal investigator for the test.\n“The cPass developed by our team can be used for contact tracing, reservoir or intermediate animal tracking, assessment of herd immunity, longevity of protective immunity and efficacy of different vaccine candidates.”\n\nAside from a\xa0rapid turnaround, other advantages the\xa0cPass serology test has are\xa0safety and scalability.\nCurrent tests\xa0for neutralising antibodies require live virus and cell materials, which are\xa0processed by highly skilled operators in biocontainment facilities. Using protein engineering, the new test replicates a part of the virus and a part of a live cell that binds to each other.\n“Basically, what is happening in your body, we have mimicked in a test tube with two engineered proteins,” said Prof Wong.\nThis means that the test has the potential to be mass produced and can be used to test a large number of people more quickly, and can be conducted in most labs without potentially exposing lab operators to live viruses, experts told the media at a press conference on Friday.\nProfessor Wang said that it took his team less than two months from conception to\xa0product development, to provisional authorisation of the test kit by Singapore’s Health Sciences Authority, which was granted\xa0last week.\nBiotech firm GenScript did the proof of concept research, product design and development, and is now commercialising the test.\xa0The Diagnostics Development Hub (DxD) at Singapore’s Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) validated the test kit and developed the manufacturing protocol and quality controls for it.\xa0\nDxD Hub will also produce\xa0the pilot batch for use in Singapore hospitals.\n“This innovative cPass diagnostic kit will be instrumental in supporting the fight against the global pandemic,” said Dr Sidney Yee, CEO of DxD Hub. “We are making cPass available to hospitals as we speak.”\nProf Wong added that there was keen interest\xa0from around the world and within the region. The\xa0test is already being tried in Malaysia and Thailand.\nDr Zhu Li, chief strategy officer of GenScript, said that applications for approval for the test are already being filed in Europe and the United States, while the company has set up production capability\xa0in China and in US in anticipation of demand.\n“The test results will be of great help to governments in guiding the resumption of work since it is extremely useful for quick and reliable surveillance to determine how widely a population has gained immunity to SARS-CoV-2 virus,” he said.\xa0\n""Detection of neutralising antibodies determines who can more safely go back to work or to more social life.""\nThis has important implications for countries that are formulating their exit strategies from lockdowns, said Professor Wong, adding that\xa0the test can also help to assess blood samples for\xa0plasma therapy.\nBlood plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients can be used for treatment if they have high levels of neutralising antibodies and the test can help to measure this quickly, said the professor.\n""This could be a game changer in the field of COVID-19 investigation,” said Professor Patrick Casey, senior vice-dean of research at Duke-NUS.\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\n', 'related_topics': ['     COVID-19 ', '     science ', '     health ']}"

      Commentary: Can Vitamin D protect you from COVID-19? There may be something to it
  </h1>, 'text': 'ADELAIDE: Recent headlines have suggested Vitamin D deficiency could increase the risk of dying from COVID-19, and in turn, that we should consider taking Vitamin D supplements to protect ourselves.\nIs this all just hype, or could Vitamin D really help in the fight against COVID-19?\nVITAMIN D AND THE IMMUNE SYSTEM\nAt least in theory, there may be something to these claims.\nNearly all immune cells have Vitamin D receptors, showing Vitamin D interacts with the immune system.\nThe active Vitamin D hormone, calcitriol, helps regulate both the innate and adaptive immune systems, our first and second lines of defence against pathogens.\nAnd Vitamin D deficiency is associated with immune dysregulation, a breakdown or change in the control of immune system processes.\nMany of the ways calcitriol affects the immune system are directly relevant to our ability to defend against viruses.\nFor example, calcitriol triggers the production of cathelicidin and other defensins – natural antivirals capable of preventing the virus from replicating and entering a cell.\nCalcitriol can also increase the number of a particular type of immune cell (CD8+ T cells), which play a critical role in clearing acute viral infections (such as influenza) in the lungs.\nCalcitriol also suppresses pro-inflammatory cytokines, molecules secreted from immune cells which, as their name suggests, promote inflammation. Some scientists have suggested Vitamin D might help to alleviate the “cytokine storm” described in the most severe COVID-19 cases.\nTHE EVIDENCE\nEvidence from randomised controlled trials suggests regular Vitamin D supplementation may help protect against acute respiratory infections.\nA recent meta-analysis brought together results from 25 trials with more than 10,000 participants who were randomised to receive Vitamin D or a placebo.\nIt found Vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of acute respiratory infections, but only when it was given daily or weekly, rather than in a large single dose.\nThe benefits of regular supplementation were greatest among participants who were severely Vitamin D deficient to begin with, for whom the risk of respiratory infection went down by 70 per cent. In others the risk decreased by 25 per cent.\nLarge one-off (or “bolus”) doses are often used as a quick way to achieve Vitamin D repletion. But in the context of respiratory infections, there were no benefits if participants received high single doses.\nIn fact, monthly or annual Vitamin D supplementation has sometimes had unexpected side effects, such as increased risk of falls and fractures, where Vitamin D was administered to protect against these outcomes.\nIt’s possible intermittent administration of large doses may interfere with the synthesis and breakdown of the enzymes regulating Vitamin D activity within the body.\nVITAMIN D AND COVID-19\nWe still have relatively little direct evidence about the role of Vitamin D in COVID-19. And while early research is interesting, much of it may be circumstantial.\nFor example, one small study from the United States and another study from Asia found a strong correlation between low Vitamin D status and severe infection with COVID-19.\nBut neither study considered any confounders.\nIn addition to the elderly, COVID-19 generally has the greatest consequences for people with pre-existing conditions.\nImportantly, people with existing medical conditions are also often Vitamin D deficient. Studies assessing ICU patients have reported high rates of deficiency even before COVID-19.\nSo we would expect to see relatively high rates of Vitamin D deficiency in seriously ill COVID-19 patients – whether Vitamin D has a role or not.\nSome researchers have noted high rates of COVID-19 infections in ethnic minority groups in the UK and US to suggest a role for Vitamin D, as ethnic minority groups tend to have lower levels of Vitamin D.\nHowever, analyses from the UK Biobank did not support a link between Vitamin D concentrations and risk of COVID-19 infection, nor that Vitamin D concentration might explain ethnic differences in getting a COVID-19 infection.\nAlthough this research adjusted for confounders, Vitamin D levels were measured 10\xa0years earlier, which is a drawback.\nResearchers have also suggested Vitamin D plays a role by looking at the average Vitamin D levels of different countries alongside their COVID-19 infections. But in the hierarchy of scientific evidence, these types of studies are weak.\nSHOULD WE TRY TO GET MORE VITAMIN D?\nThere are several registered trials on Vitamin D and COVID-19 in their early stages. So hopefully in time we’ll get some more clarity about the potential effects of Vitamin D on COVID-19 infection, particularly from studies using stronger designs.\nIn the meantime, even if we don’t know whether Vitamin D can help mitigate the risk of or outcomes from COVID-19, we do know being Vitamin D deficient won’t help.\nIt’s difficult to get enough Vitamin D from food alone. A generous portion of oily fish can cover much of our need, but it’s neither healthy nor palatable to eat this every day.\nWe may get most of our Vitamin D from the sun. The amount of exposure we need to get enough Vitamin D is generally low, only a few minutes during the summer.\nIf you don’t think you’re getting enough Vitamin D, speak to your GP. They may recommend incorporating daily supplements into your routine.\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\nElina Hypponen is Professor of Nutritional and Genetic Epidemiology at the University of South Australia.

      Almost a quarter of infected household members of COVID-19 patients were asymptomatic, Singapore study finds
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: A Singapore study that tested the household close contacts of COVID-19 patients\xa0has found that\xa0an estimated 23 per cent of those infected were asymptomatic.\xa0\nThe seroepidemiological study conducted by the\xa0National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) traced about 2,500\xa0household close contacts who were placed under quarantine.\nSeroepidemiology uses data\xa0from antibody-based tests to identify which population segments have been exposed to an infectious disease, and in what proportion. It can give\xa0insight into under-diagnosed mild cases and how they may contribute to the spread of COVID-19, NCID had said.\nAvailable studies of viral concentrations in swab tests suggest\xa0that asymptomatic COVID-19 patients have similar viral concentrations compared with symptomatic patients at comparable stages of illness,\xa0said\xa0Associate Professor Ng Oon Tek, NCID senior consultant.\n""Multiple studies including an analysis from Singapore reported in our local media have demonstrated onward transmission from pre-symptomatic patients while they were still asymptomatic,"" he said.\nThe earlier study published in April\xa0had found that\xa0three people in Singapore had caught the virus after visiting the same church as an infected couple from Wuhan.\xa0\nThe couple, who were Chinese tourists,\xa0showed no symptoms at the time.\nOne woman who fell ill sat in\xa0the same seat in the church that the couple had occupied earlier that day.\nFor the NCID study on close household contacts,\xa0researchers\xa0did not perform repeated swab tests among asymptomatic subjects, and were not able to estimate the proportion of presymptomatic subjects, said Assoc Prof Ng.\nAsymptomatic COVID-19 cases are labelled presymptomatic if they develop COVID-19 symptoms later. A COVID-19 positive person can only be classified presymptomatic after observing the individual, usually for at least a week, for the development of symptoms, said Assoc Prof Ng.\nASYMPTOMATIC CASES IN SINGAPORE, ASIA\nSingapore has not disclosed national figures for asymptomatic cases but authorities have\xa0said that most of the cases among migrant workers are mild or show no symptoms.\xa0\nOn Thursday, the Ministry of Health reported 15 COVID-19 cases in the community, all of which were asymptomatic. Of\xa0the 99\xa0cases reported in the community since May 18, 57 were asymptomatic, according to\xa0MOH data.\nSouth Korea has said 20 to 30 per cent of its cases were asymptomatic, Reuters reported. In India, around\xa028 per cent of 40,184 people who tested positive between Jan\xa022 and Apr\xa030 were asymptomatic, according to a study.\nIn Vietnam, which has kept the number of COVID-19\xa0cases to just slightly more than\xa0300, almost 37 per cent did not display any symptoms, Reuters has reported, citing\xa0health ministry data.\nA study on the coronavirus cases on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship had found that about 18 per cent of the 634 cases were asymptomatic.\nThe proportion of asymptomatic cases and whether they can transmit the disease to others is an indicator of the transmission potential of the disease, said the study authors. It can range from\xa08 per cent for measles and 32 per cent\xa0for norovirus infections, and up to 90 to 95 per cent for polio.\nAn editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine on May 28 called asymptomatic transmission the ""Achilles’ heel"" of\xa0the US\' strategies to control COVID-19.\nFor the virus, having a large number of asymptomatic and mild infections means it is better able to\xa0spread and persist in the community. But COVID-19 can also be severe enough to put about 5 per cent of those it infects in intensive care.\nWhile the death rate in Singapore is low, at less than 1 per cent, about 6 per cent of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the US have died.\xa0This combination of surreptitious transmission and lethality has made the virus harder to deal with compared with\xa0outbreaks\xa0such as SARS.\n""Multiple clinical studies ... have demonstrated that COVID-19 infected persons with mild or even no symptoms are still be able to spread the disease,"" said Assoc Prof Ng.\nAuthorities here have repeatedly warned that re-opening too quickly after the\xa0""circuit breaker"" will result in a resurgence of cases.

It reports that a swine flu virus is circulating in China that has the potential for pandemic spread in humans.\nThis sounds highly alarming, but just how worried should we be?\nThere are millions of cases of flu each year, resulting in hundreds of thousands of deaths. These are caused by “seasonal” or type B influenza viruses.\nThere are also other types of flu viruses that are harboured by animals, notably the type A viruses of birds.\nThankfully, most of these infect humans poorly. But as they are different from the seasonal viruses, humans have no or little existing immunity to them.\nSo a type A virus that acquires the ability to readily infect humans and transmit between us will rip through our population, leading to a pandemic in much the same way that SARS-CoV-2 has done.\nThe Spanish flu of 1918, which caused an estimated 50 million deaths, demonstrates why pandemic influenza viruses have been the focus of the World Health Organization and governments around the world.\nHOW TYPE A VIRUSES INFECT HUMANS\nInfluenza viruses infect respiratory cells by binding to a specific receptor on the cells’ surface. Humans and birds have different versions of this receptor, which means avian flu viruses bind poorly to human cells. This is why infectivity in humans is low.\nHowever, flu viruses can readily exchange segments of their genetic material (in a process known as reassortment) if two different viruses infect the same cell. This can create novel flu viruses with combined characteristics of their parents.\nIt’s feared that a reassorted virus could combine the great harmfulness of some bird viruses with high infectivity for humans – a potentially devastating combination.\nAnd it’s pigs that may make this possible. Their respiratory cells contain both versions of the receptor mentioned before, making them susceptible to a wide range of flu viruses. This means they’re the most likely host in which reassortment occurs.\nBecause of this, there’s an extensive global surveillance network for identifying novel and potentially dangerous flu viruses. And that’s what this recent paper has found that swine influenza viruses have emerged in China that display many of the features we’d anticipate potentially pandemic strains having.\nTHE WARNING SIGNS\nAmong viruses isolated from pigs in China between 2011 and 2018, six distinct types were identified. In 2011, the predominant viruses were variants of the 2009 H1N1 swine flu virus. Subsequent viruses bore the hallmarks of arising from reassortment.\nIn particular, one type (referred to as G4) was first detected in samples taken in 2013, and by 2018 had become the dominant and only type isolated.\nThis coincided with an apparent increase in respiratory disease in pigs, suggesting that an original G4 virus had become particularly well adapted to infecting pigs, and had largely replaced other swine flu viruses in China, giving rise to the series of problematic G4 viruses now in circulation.\nTests of the potential for human infection by G4 viruses produced worrying results. Ferrets have similar patterns of receptors to humans, display similar influenza disease to humans and can transmit influenza viruses between themselves.\nThis makes them a good model for studying the potential effects of a flu virus in people.\nWhen tested, the G4 viruses caused more severe disease in ferrets than the other types tested, and also were readily transmitted by both direct contact and respiratory droplets. This shows that the G4 viruses have the potential to cause severe disease in humans and spread readily between us.\nThe authors then tested whether antibodies that recognise flu viruses that have caused disease in humans in recent years – including those generated in response to a recent version of a flu vaccine – would recognise the G4 viruses.\nThey did not, suggesting that the human population has little to no pre-existing immunity to these viruses.\nHOW WORRIED SHOULD WE BE?\nBlood samples from swine farm workers (who have close and regular contact with pigs) and from the wider population were then tested for the presence of antibodies that recognise the G4 viruses.\nSurprisingly, 10 per cent of samples from farm workers and about 4 per cent of samples from the general population contained such antibodies. This suggests that G4 viruses have already been infecting humans.\nIt was noted that the frequency of positive samples, and thus the frequency of infection, had increased in recent years.\nSo, G4 viruses appear to have all the traits we fear for a potentially pandemic virus – efficient binding to and replication in human respiratory cells, high virulence and transmission in the ferret model, and lack of existing immunity from other flu viruses or vaccines.\nHowever, the apparently unnoticed yet significant level of infection in swine workers and others suggest that, at the moment, these viruses do not generally cause severe disease or spread readily.\nBut they may represent viruses already highly adapted to infecting humans that only require minor adaptations for frequent human-human spread and/or increased severity. They do appear to be a cause for real concern.\nWhile most pandemic response planning has been centred on flu, COVID-19 has shown the need to broaden that planning. This paper is a timely reminder that perhaps even before COVID-19 has been conquered, the need for more robust planning for the next pandemic should begin.\nExtreme events are often described as once in a lifetime. We can’t afford to treat pandemics that way. SARS, MERS, H1N1 and now COVID-19 have all emerged in the last 20 years, demonstrating that pandemic viruses arise with alarming regularity, and are likely to continue to do so.\nAndrew Preston is Reader in Biology and Biochemistry at the University of Bath.

      Reporting of COVID-19 deaths not 'clear-cut', official numbers may not reflect true toll: Expert
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Reporting the number of deaths from COVID-19 is not as straightforward as it may seem due to several reasons, said infectious diseases expert Professor Dale Fisher on Thursday evening (Jul 23) in a\xa0webinar.\nThe chair of Infection Prevention and Control at the National University Health\xa0System (NUHS) highlighted this in an online talk which also featured the editor-in-chief of British medical journal the Lancet, Richard Horton.\nGiving an example of a person who was in a traffic accident, Professor Fisher said that in such a case, it was clear that just because the victim had COVID-19 did not mean that the cause of death was the disease.\xa0\n""Having COVID-19 and dying\xa0does not mean you died from COVID-19. In short,\xa0it has to be resulting from a clinically compatible illness in a probable case,"" he said in a virtual lecture that is the latest in\xa0a series of COVID-19 updates organised by the National University of Singapore\'s Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine and NUHS.\nHowever, there have been cases of heart failure in COVID-19 patients which may not be as clear-cut. Prof Fisher pointed out that COVID-19 is associated with ""thromboembolic phenomenon"" and ""vasculitic phenomenon"", or blood clots and inflammation of the blood vessels.\xa0\nAccording to World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, heart failure due to myocardial infarction with COVID-19 is not classified as a COVID death.\xa0He said: ""We are actually following this, but it\'s already showing some of the complexities.""\nIn Singapore, there have been a number of deaths related to heart or blood issues which were not added to the official COVID-19 death toll of 27.\xa0\nDoctors here were in June advised to be “watchful” for cardiovascular symptoms in COVID-19 patients, with “emerging data” globally about the increased risks of blood clots and heart disease in such patients.\xa0\nProfessor Fisher also said\xa0that the official reports\xa0from various countries may not reflect the true death toll of the disease. More than\xa0620,000 deaths from the coronavirus have been reported globally.\xa0\nComparing deaths from all causes from June this year and in previous years, he pointed out that the increase in deaths in some countries compared to\xa0the average in previous years\xa0has exceeded the number of reported COVID deaths.\xa0\nIn the US, the difference between the ""excess deaths"" and the reported COVID-19 deaths amounted to about 30,000, he estimated.\n""So pretty much in most of these countries - not all of them - we find the excess deaths are\xa0more than the baseline plus COVID - so\xa0this brings you to wonder why,"" he said.\nThis could be due to undiagnosed or unreported COVID-19 cases, due to some cases that do not meet WHO definitions, or there could more deaths from\xa0non-COVID diseases, he said.\n""So the moral of the story is that we really should be looking at all-cause mortality, rather than bringing in the subjectivity of saying \'was it caused by COVID?\'"" he said.\nPROXIMITY BETWEEN SCIENTIFIC AND MEDICAL COMMUNITIES AND POLITICAL CLASS KEY IN BATTLING COVID-19: EDITOR-IN-CHIEF OF THE LANCET\xa0\nProfessor Fisher was speaking after editor-in-chief of the Lancet, Professor Horton, answered questions from the viewers on ""Learning\xa0from COVID-19 to build a resilient future"".\nThe professor is known for his scathing criticism of the UK and US governments\' pandemic response, but he said that Singapore, like a number of other small states, have handled the outbreak well.\nResponding to a question on Singapore\'s management of COVID-19 so far, Prof Horton said: ""I think Singapore\'s been an exemplar ...\xa0There is an ability to have a proximity between the scientific and medical communities\xa0and the political class.\xa0\n""When I look at New Zealand, for example, (Prime Minister)\xa0Jacinda Ardern has just been incredible because she got good science policy advice and she\'s close to the science policy and medical community, and it\'s the same with (Singapore) ... So I think small can be good.""\nHe\xa0said that countries who had\xa0leaders that are trained in the sciences appeared to have done better, for example Germany\'s Angela Merkel.\n""Certainly in my country, science is not a background for many political leaders and civil servants ... you need to have a mix in government, you need to have people who do have literacy in science,"" the Briton said.\nProf Horton also defended a\xa0Lancet editorial which\xa0said that US needs a president in the White House who will not let public health be guided by partisan politics in response to another participant\'s question.\n""The great leaps in health that have taken place over recent centuries\xa0haven\'t just come because of some great randomised trial\xa0published in a journal, the great leaps in health have come through political struggle,"" he said.\n""Are we going to stand on the sidelines and say that\'s not a struggle for us?

      Doping: New Zealand researchers hail 'breakthrough' with non-targeted test
  </h1>, 'text': 'WELLINGTON: Researchers at New Zealand\'s Otago University are hailing a ""breakthrough"" in the fight against drug cheats with a non-targeted test for designer steroids which they hope can be deployed in time for the 2022 Winter Olympics.\nProfessor Alison Heather, who led the development of the test, said it would detect designer anabolic steroids before anti-doping authorities were aware they even existed.\n""It\'s a breakthrough in that it\'s a non-targeted test, so we don\'t need to know the structure for what we\'re fishing for in order to be able to detect a designer anabolic steroid,"" Heather told Reuters by telephone from Dunedin.\nHeather said she first considered developing the test in 2004 when she started researching the use of tetrohydogestrinone (THG), the drug developed by the BALCO laboratory in San Francisco nicknamed ""The Clear"".\nAmerican sprinter Marion Jones was one of many high-profile athletes who ultimately admitted to using it.\nHeather said that drug had been used by athletes for some seven years before testers were even aware it existed.\n""We called it a designer steroid because it had a structure that nobody knew about,"" she said.\n""If nobody knows about it, there\'s no fingerprint for mass spectrometry so it goes undetected. Since then I was thinking that we need a non-targeted test.""\nThe new test did not search for specific markers but focussed on detecting changes at the cellular level.\n""All anabolic steroids ... activate a common pathway inside the cell so I have exploited that pathway to build the test,"" she said.\n""If they want to have an anabolic effect in their body they have to activate the cellular pathway and our test will pick up any drug that activates that anabolic pathway.\n""So for once we\'re on a level footing. We don\'t need to wait for somebody to have some anomaly in their blood work saying, \'hey they\'re taking something but we don\'t know what it is\' to find it. We can see that there is something there.""\n\'RAPID TESTING\'\nHeather said designer steroids were still being developed and sold over the Internet, despite the widespread implementation of biological passports in elite sport.\nThe test would show any anomalies in that passport, which is a profile of biological markers that detect changes over time as athletes undergo regular in- and out-of-competition testing.\nAt this stage, the test samples still needed to be analysed in laboratories but results will be known within four hours, she said.\nHer ultimate goal was to have ""rapid testing"" capability where results can be produced within minutes of a test being taken.\nHeather added she had developed the test alongside one for the horse racing industry and the equine tests would be rolled out to labs by October, with human testing kits just ""months behind"".\nShe has already been in touch with scientists at the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) about the test and would shortly be in a position to discuss how it could be rolled out with the regulatory side of the watchdog.\n""In the next 12 months we hope to be selling the products to medical laboratories,"" she said.\n""But 2022, for Beijing and the Commonwealth Games, is when we hope to see them in use in competition.""\n(Editing by Peter Rutherford)\n', 'related_topics': ['     New Zealand ', '     science ']}"

The sample container on the end of the robot arm penetrated so deeply into the asteroid and with such force, however, that rocks got sucked in and became wedged around the rim of the lid.\nThe team was scrambling to put the sample container into the return capsule as early as Tuesday — much sooner than originally planned — for the long trip home. Particles are continuing to escape, and scientists want to minimize the loss.\n“Time is of the essence,” said Thomas Zurbuchen, chief of NASA's science missions.\nA cloud of asteroid particles could be seen swirling around the spacecraft as it backed away from Bennu — at least one-half of an ounce (5 to 10 grams) at any one time. The situation appeared to stabilize, according to Lauretta, once the robot arm stopped moving and was locked into place.\nThe requirement for Orisis-Rex — NASA's first asteroid sample return mission, totaling more than US$800 million — was at least 2 ounces (60 grams) of samples for return. The carbon-rich material holds the preserved building blocks of our solar system and could help scientists better understand how the planets were formed and how life originated on Earth.\nLaunched in 2016, the spacecraft arrived at Bennu in 2018.

      NUS researchers find a way to turn tree branches and prawn shells into supplements and medicine
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Researchers from the National University of Singapore (NUS) have found a way to turn the shells of crustaceans, as well as discarded branches, into nutritional supplements and medicine.\xa0\nThis novel process can turn prawn and crab shells into L-DOPA, a widely used drug to treat Parkinson’s disease, NUS said in a press release on Thursday (Oct 29).\nA similar method can be used to convert wood waste into proline, which is essential for the formation of healthy collagen and cartilage.\nNot only can this process\xa0save time and lower production costs, it also helps to reduce reliance on the use of non-renewable fossil fuels and energy-consuming processes, said NUS.\nWaste such as prawn shells and branches pruned from trees usually end up in landfills.\xa0\nThe global food processing industry generates as much as 8 million tonnes of crustacean shell waste annually, said NUS. Last year, Singapore also generated more than 438,000 tonnes of wood waste. This includes branches pruned from trees and sawdust from workshops.\nDeriving ways to upcycle these food and agricultural waste materials into useful compounds will reap benefits without straining landfills.\n“Although reusing waste materials has gained traction in recent years, the typical output of chemicals produced from waste recycling is often less diversified than the conventional chemical synthesis pipeline which uses crude oil or gas.\n“To overcome the limitations, the NUS researchers came up with a pathway that marries a chemical approach with a biological process,” said the university.\xa0\nThe NUS team, led by Associate Professor Yan Ning and Assistant Professor Zhou Kang from the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, took four years to derive their method.\nThe researchers first applied chemical processes to the waste materials and converted them into a substance that can be “digested” by microbes.\nThe second step involved a biological process, similar to the fermentation of grapes into wine, where they engineered special strains of bacteria such as Escherichia coli to convert the substance produced in the chemical process into a higher value product such as amino acids.\nPRODUCING ORGANIC CHEMICALS CHEAPER AND FASTER\nL-DOPA is conventionally produced from L-tyrosine, a chemical made from fermenting sugars. NUS said the yield produced by their method using crustacean waste is similar to that achieved in the traditional method using sugars.\nNUS said their method also has the potential to provide L-DOPA at a lower cost given the abundance and low cost of shell waste.\nGlucose, which is the most common sugar used in the conventional production method, costs between US$400 to US$600 per tonne while shrimp waste costs only about US$100 per tonne.\nMeanwhile, proline is conventionally produced through pure biological processes. NUS said their team’s method replaced most of the transformations by using chemical processes, which are much faster.\n“As a result, the new integrated process could achieve higher productivity, and potentially lead to reductions in capital investment and operating costs,” added NUS.\nAlthough chemical processes are rapid and can utilise a variety of harsh conditions to break down a wide variety of waste materials as no living organisms are involved, it can only produce simple substances.\nOn the other hand, biological processes are a lot slower and require very specific conditions for the microbes to flourish, but can produce complex substances which tend to be of higher value.\n“By combining both chemical and biological processes, we can reap the benefits of both to create high value materials,” said Asst Prof Zhou. \xa0\nPOTENTIAL TO UPCYCLE OTHER TYPES OF WASTE\nNUS said their team’s methodology has the potential to be applied to different types of waste materials. This process can also be tailored based on the type of waste as well as the target end product.\nMoving forward, NUS said the team is looking to adapt their unique process to other forms of waste, such as carbon dioxide and waste paper.\nThis would reduce reliance on non-renewable resources for acquiring chemicals which are important constituents of many nutritional supplements and medicine, NUS added.\n""Given that these chemicals are found in a vast array of commercially valuable pharmaceuticals, pigments and nutrients, we are excited to expand our research and develop new methodologies to produce value-added chemicals from other abundant, locally available substrates found in Singapore,” shared Assoc Prof Yan.\xa0\nThe research team is also planning to scale up the processes currently developed in their laboratories\xa0and to work with industrial partners to commercialise this technology.\n', 'related_topics': ['     National University of Singapore ', '     science ']}"

Its colour intensity changes with an increasing concentration of bioamines as the meat decays further, the university explained.\nThe research team\xa0developed a classification system\xa0– fresh, less fresh or spoiled\xa0– using an international standard that determines meat freshness, NTU\xa0said.\nThe second part of the electronic nose is a barcode ""reader"", which uses artificial intelligence (AI) to interpret the combination of colours on the barcode.\nTo make the electronic nose portable, the reader is integrated into a smartphone application that can yield results in 30 seconds, NTU said.\nThe NTU research team, which collaborated with scientists from China\'s Jiangnan University and Australia\'s Monash University,\xa0trained the AI algorithm to pick out patterns using more than 3,400 images of barcodes glued to the packaging film of chicken, fish and beef.\xa0\nSubsequent tests of the electronic nose revealed an overall 98.5 per cent accuracy rate – 100 per cent accuracy in identifying spoiled meats, and 96 to 99 per cent accuracy for fresh and less fresh meats.\nWhile electronic noses have been extensively researched, there have been bottlenecks to commercialisation due to issues with accurately detecting and identifying odour, said director of NTU\'s Innovative Centre for Flexible Devices Professor Chen Xiaodong.\nThe NTU invention offered ""both a robust sensor setup and a data analysis method that can accurately predict scent fingerprints"", he said.\n""Our proof-of-concept artificial olfactory system, which we tested in real-life scenarios, can be easily integrated into packaging materials and yields results in a short time without the bulky wiring used for electrical signal collection in some e-noses that were developed recently,"" said Prof Chen.\n""These barcodes help consumers to save money by ensuring that they do not discard products that are still fit for consumption, which also helps the environment.\n""The biodegradable and non-toxic nature of the barcodes also means they could be safely applied in all parts of the food supply chain to ensure food freshness.""\nA patent has been filed for the invention\xa0and the team is working with a Singapore agribusiness company to extend the concept\xa0to\xa0other types of perishables, NTU said.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Nanyang Technological University ', '     food ', '     technology ', '     science ']}"

      First global map of bee species jointly created by NUS researcher
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The first map of its kind detailing the distribution of bee species around the globe has been created by a team of researchers from several countries, including from Singapore.\nThere are more than 20,000 known species of bees, but accurate data about how they are spread across the world is sparse.\nTo create the global map, researchers combined a global checklist of the known bee species with almost six million additional public records of where individual bee species have appeared around the world, said scientific journal publisher Cell Press in a media release.\nThe map provides a ""much clearer picture"" of how many species of bees are distributed in different geographic areas, said the release. A research paper containing the map was published in science journal Current Biology on Friday (Nov 20).\nThe study involved a team of researchers from Singapore, the United Kingdom, China and the United States.\nThe checklist of 20,000 bee species used in creating the map was compiled by Dr John Ascher, an assistant professor at National University of Singapore\'s (NUS) department of biological science. He has been working on the checklist since 2003.\n""People think of bees as just honey bees, bumble bees, and maybe a few others, but there are more species of bees than of birds and mammals combined, said Dr Ascher.\nSpeaking\xa0at a media briefing held at NUS on Tuesday before the report was released,\xa0Dr Ascher noted that studies on where species are living can allow researchers to assess reports of a decline in bee populations around the world.\n\n""We can use that as a benchmark to get at what we really want to know down the road, which is what is driving alleged bee declines,"" Dr Ascher said.\n""A lot of these reports (of declines) are based on ... England or the Netherlands ... very few places. And they have very sparse coverage for most of the rest of the world. So they\'re reporting global declines but their data set is not really global.""\n\xa0\nBEES, THEIR DISTRIBUTION AND CLIMATE CHANGE\nFindings from the researchers found that there are more species of bees in the Northern than Southern Hemisphere and more bees in arid as well as temperate environments as compared to the tropics.\nWhile most animals and plants follow a pattern known as a latitudinal gradient where diversity increases toward the tropics and decreases towards the poles, bees are an exception to the rule.\nThere are far fewer bee species in forests and jungles than in arid desert environments because trees tend to provide fewer sources of food for bees than low-lying plant and flowers.\n""When it rains in the desert, there are these unpredictable mass blooms that can literally carpet the entire area,"" said the study\'s first author Michael Orr, a postdoctoral fellow at the Institute of Zoology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing.\n""There\'s a much higher turnover in the desert because of how patchy the resources are year after year. So there\'s a lot of potential for new species there.""\nClimate change has also been another factor which some have said affects the population and distribution of bees globally. However, Dr Ascher noted that such studies may not be entirely representative of the current situation.\n""Some studies have claimed to show (the impact of) climate change for bees - especially bumblebees, but in my opinion, they\'re not well done for a number of reasons,"" he told reporters.\n""Sometimes they\'re mixing up a situation in Europe and North America ... the data sets (in these two regions) are very different, and the environments are quite different. The other thing is that you have confounding factors ... especially the spread of epizootics, so you have fungal pathogens and other things that are wiping out a lot of bumblebees.""\nThere has however been changes in the distribution of bees, noted Dr Ascher. This could be due to a number of different factors, he noted.\n""I\'m most familiar with eastern North America, and I\'m in a way a bit pessimistic about detecting climate change there just because there\'s been massive changes in land use,"" Dr Ascher explained.\n""Also the eastern United States was deforested, and now it\'s reforesting with second growth vegetation, so you detect big changes over time in the bee fauna, but to attribute them to a particular cause very difficult in my opinion.""\n', 'related_topics': ['     NUS ', '     science ']}"

      NUS team invents ‘fast and safe’ way to convert natural gas to solid form, says method can boost energy security
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: A team of researchers from the National University of Singapore (NUS) has developed a new mixture that can convert natural gas into solid form within 15 minutes, making it easier to transport and store the gas in a “fast and safe” way.\nThis could help “enhance” Singapore’s energy security in the long run, said the university.\nSingapore is mostly reliant on natural gas - considered the least polluting fossil fuel - for its energy needs.\xa0\nCurrently, ways of storing natural gas include liquefying it at about -160 degrees Celsius or compressing it to almost 250 times atmospheric pressure, said NUS, noting that it can be a challenge to store the gas safely and affordably.\nIt added that these approaches do not work at a large scale because they are either expensive or not so safe to store for long periods.\nTo address the challenges, the NUS team formulated a “novel, low-toxicity additive mixture” which speeds up the conversion of natural gas into a non-explosive solid form, said the university in a press release.\n“The conversion can be completed in just 15 minutes - the fastest time so far,” it added.\nLed by Associate Professor Praveen Linga from the NUS Faculty of Engineering, researchers are now aiming to convert larger volumes of gas into smaller volumes of solid at a pilot scale of 100kg per day.\xa0\xa0If successful, this will enable the commercial adoption of the solidified natural gas technology and create a solid that is stable to store at atmospheric pressure, said NUS. Researchers hope to eventually scale it up for industrial use.\n“This is especially relevant to natural gas importing countries like Singapore, where 95 per cent of electricity is generated using natural gas,” said Assoc Prof Linga who is from the department of chemical and biomolecular engineering.\xa0\xa0“The development of such gas storage technologies would help enhance the country’s energy security.”\nTraditionally, most of Singapore’s supply of natural gas comes in gas form through pipelines from Indonesia and Malaysia.\xa0\nSince May 2013, Singapore has been importing liquefied natural gas (LNG) to diversify and secure its energy sources. The country’s LNG Terminal currently has four storage tanks which can hold 800,000 cubic metres of LNG.\n“Our breakthrough can really be put into perspective when you consider that it takes millions and millions of years for gas hydrates to form in nature, yet with our correct addition of secret ingredients to the system in small quantities, the same process can be effected in the laboratory in a matter of minutes,” said research fellow Dr Gaurav Bhattacharjee, who worked on the project.\xa0\nThe new additive mixture contains L-tryptophan, an essential amino acid in diets. This amino acid can also “greatly speed up” the “caging” of natural gas into solid hydrate, which is also known as combustible ice, said NUS.\xa0\nAccording to the university, the formulation done by the team produces the quickest reaction rate to date - more than twice as fast as existing standards - while being less toxic and safer to handle.\nWhile other researchers have managed to speed this reaction up artificially in the past, they resorted to using “highly toxic additives” which are unsafe for both the environment and personnel involved, NUS added.\xa0\nThe research was partly funded under the Energy Innovation Research Programme, which is administered by the Energy Market Authority and funded by the National Research Foundation.\n\n', 'related_topics': ['     NUS ', '     science ']}"

      Chinese craft carrying Moon rocks returns to Earth: Xinhua
  </h1>, 'text': 'BEIJING:\xa0An unmanned Chinese spacecraft carrying rocks and soil from the Moon returned safely to Earth early on Thursday (Dec 17) in the first mission in four decades to collect lunar samples, the Xinhua news agency said.\nThe capsule carrying the samples collected by the Chang\'e-5 space probe landed in northern China\'s Inner Mongolia region, Xinhua said, quoting the China National Space Administration (CNSA).\nThe agency\'s director, Zhang Kejian, declared the mission a success, Xinhua said.\nWith this mission, China became only the third country to have retrieved samples from the Moon, following the United States and the Soviet Union in the 1960s and 1970s.\nBeijing is looking to catch up with Washington and Moscow after taking decades to match its rivals\' achievements and has poured billions into its military-run space programme.\nChang\'e-5, named after a mythical Chinese Moon goddess, landed on the Moon on Dec\xa01. While there, it raised the Chinese flag, the country\'s space agency said.\nWhen the probe left the Moon two days later, that marked the first time that China had achieved take-off from an extraterrestrial body, it said.\nThe module then went through the delicate operation of linking up in lunar orbit with the part of the spacecraft that brought the samples back to Earth.\nScientists hope the samples will help them learn about the Moon\'s origins, formation and volcanic activity on its surface.\nThe Chang\'e-5 mission was to collect two kilograms (4.5 pounds) of material in an area known as Oceanus Procellarum - or ""Ocean of Storms"" - a vast, previously unexplored lava plain, according to the science journal Nature.\nThe capsule will be airlifted to Beijing for opening, and the Moon samples will be delivered to a research team for analysis and study, the space agency said.\nSPACE DREAM\nChina will make some of the samples available to scientists in other countries, Pei Zhaoyu, deputy director of the Lunar Exploration and Space Program Center of CNSA, has said.\nXinhua described the mission as one of the most challenging and complicated in China\'s aerospace history. The probe comprised separate craft to get to the Moon, land on it and collect the samples, get back up and then return the rocks and soil to Earth, Xinhua said.\nThe return capsule entered the Earth\'s atmosphere at an altitude of about 120 kilometres (75 miles). When it was about 10 km above land, a parachute opened and it landed smoothly, after which a search team recovered it, the agency said.\nThis was the first such attempt to collect such samples since the Soviet Union\'s Luna 24 mission in 1976.\nUnder President Xi Jinping, plans for China\'s ""space dream"", as he calls it, have been put into overdrive.\nChina hopes to have a crewed space station by 2022 and eventually send humans to the Moon.\nChina launched its first satellite in 1970, while human spaceflight took decades longer - with Yang Liwei becoming the country\'s first ""taikonaut"" in 2003.\nA Chinese lunar rover landed on the far side of the Moon in January 2019 in a global first that boosted Beijing\'s aspirations to become a space superpower.\nThe latest probe is among a slew of ambitious targets, which include creating a powerful rocket capable of delivering payloads heavier than those NASA and private rocket firm SpaceX can handle, a lunar base, a permanently crewed space station, and a Mars rover.\n', 'related_topics': ['     China ', '     science ']}"

      Commentary: Elon Musk's recent trial spacecraft may have exploded, but we are one step closer to Mars
  </h1>, 'text': 'CAMBRIDGE: Private company SpaceX launched SN8, a prototype of its Starship spacecraft, designed to go to the Moon and Mars, on Dec 10. Its short flight attracted a great deal of attention for its final few seconds before landing – when it exploded.\nBut consider the near perfect totality of its six-and-a-half-minute flight. Look at the groundbreaking technology and manoeuvres involved. It is reasonable to view this as a hugely successful test.\nOrdinary spacecraft return to Earth by using the “aerodynamic drag” in the atmosphere to slow their re-entry. Decelerating from 20,000 miles per hour dissipates a lot of heat which is why they carry heat shields, and the final touchdown is controlled by parachutes.\nThe actual rocket engines don’t make a safe landing – they burn up and crash into the sea.\nThis is a real waste of resources. SpaceX’s founder and CEO Elon Musk is instead trying to reuse as much of the spacecraft as possible.\nIf your ultimate destination is the Moon and onward to Mars, this makes a lot of sense because you can much more easily refuel at judicious locations along the way than build a new rocket.\nA FULLY REUSABLE ROCKET\nStarship is a fully reusable rocket system designed to carry 100 tonnes of cargo into Earth orbit and beyond.\nIt has a “booster” first stage which propels it into orbit and separates. The booster stage is designed to land safely and to be reused.\nSpaceX figured out how to do this with the Falcon rocket, but that’s only two thirds of the system. With Starship, the third of the system that helps propel the spacecraft further than Earth orbit is never ejected.\nLanding the first stage booster is “easy” because it is ejected two minutes after launch and therefore returns to Earth from a relatively low altitude – never reaching super high speeds.\nNASA defines “high” hypersonic speed as a “Mach number” from 10 to 25. The booster only reaches about Mach 6.\nStarship itself will be returning from orbit, reaching Mach 25. At this speed, the heat of reentry will melt the engines off.\nYou therefore need a substantial heat shield which dissipates 99 per cent of the energy – protecting the cargo and those all-important rockets that you need for landing.\nNASA’s partially reusable Space Shuttle had huge wings used to glide the vehicle onto a runway. But wings are heavy and they reduce the potential payload capacity.\nAlso, they won’t work on Mars or the Moon because there’s a lack of atmosphere – and runways.\nBELLY-FLOP DYNAMICS\nThe ingenuity of Starship is that it just “belly-flops” all the way down – a type of free fall in which the atmosphere gradually slows down its speed.\nAs it nears the ground, it should be slow enough for a short flip-and-landing burn to touch down softly on the pad.\nNo other vehicle flies like this on purpose. Planes are designed to keep the air flow attached to the wings to provide lift. If you lose that air flow, you fall out of the sky – a condition called stall.\nStarship enters the atmosphere at a 90 degree angle. That means it is fully stalled. Just as a leaf flutters to the ground this is an inherently unstable configuration and the aerodynamics are impossible to predict.\nThis is where active control comes in. Starship has four flaps and they’re used just as a skydiver uses their four arms to control free fall.\nWith the SN8 test flight, Space X has shown that it’s possible to control a belly-flop. The drop from 12.5km gave SpaceX the conditions of the last half of a return back from orbit.\nSpaceX will have gathered flight data that allows it to know how the aerodynamics of a belly-flop work. In particular, it will know how well the flaps work and how precisely to keep the craft stable and land it on target.\nWe can see on the videos released by SpaceX that the flaps are under good control. This looks like great news for SpaceX.\nENORMOUS AMOUNT OF FUEL NEEDED FOR LANDING\nBeing fully reusable, Starship should work out far cheaper than conventional single use craft. But it’s a tricky business to work out exactly how much fuel you need to carry.\nConventional aircraft always take off with a bit of fuel to spare, but they can always make an emergency landing if they miscalculate.\nRockets need to launch with an enormous amount of fuel just to be sure you have enough for the landing. It’s like going on a 14-day camping trip and spending 13 days carrying the water for your last day.\nIt’s likely that the tank for SN8 was almost completely empty when it came in to land.\nThe amount of fuel you need is given by “the rocket equation”. This shows that if you want to launch 100 tonnes of payload to the Moon at a speed of 12,000 metres per second you need a staggering 2,000 tonnes of fuel.\nWhen it comes to the type of fuel, it’s interesting that kerosene and hydrogen (as used by Apollo 11) are still the most popular rocket fuels around. The laws of physics and chemistry haven’t changed very much in fifty years.\nBut Starship is actually pioneering the use of methane as a fuel. Despite being harder to work with, it gives a bit more thrust.\nAnd perhaps more importantly there’s plenty of methane on Mars, which is obviously the ultimate destination for SpaceX.\nSo why did SN8 crash?\nYou can see in the video some green flashes just before landing. The engines are made with copper, which burns with a characteristic green flame.\nSpaceX says there was a problem with fuel pressure just at the last moment, meaning the rocket couldn’t slow down. The resulting excess oxygen started burning up the engines themselves.\nIf it weren’t for the last few seconds then the landing could have been perfect. Engineers will now be looking to fix that problem for SN9.\nHugh Hunt is Reader in Engineering Dynamics and Vibration at the University of Cambridge.

      When the medicine doesn’t work any more: Looking for new weapons against diseases
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Mention cockroaches and many of us may react with disgust and fear.\nBut Naveed Khan of the American University of Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates thinks the household pest is the source of the next range of bacteria-killing compounds.\nHe said: “Cockroaches have been here for more than 300 million years. These species have been so successful in adapting and evolving they must have something, some molecules in them to protect them against infectious diseases.”\nThe professor hit the jackpot when cellular content in the brains of cockroaches proved effective against the superbug, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Superbugs are bacteria that cause infections easily and are resistant to a wide variety of antibiotics.\nHe found that “just less than 5 microgrammes” of cockroach brain mixture killed more than a million MRSA bacteria, a “100-per-cent kill rate”.\nWATCH: How cockroaches could stop the next disease outbreak (4:49)\nHis findings are among the efforts of a global community of scientists and physicians who are fighting a growing health threat: Many disease-causing bacteria have become resistant to antibiotics, and some parasites have become resistant to other drugs.\nIf new drugs or treatments are not available quickly, these diseases could develop into global health calamities.\nCrucially, new weapons are being developed in the anti-microbial infection race, the series Disease Hunters finds out. But are they enough against increasingly resourceful bacteria and viruses?\nNATURE’S PHARMACY\nIn his search for solutions, Khan was inspired when he spotted cockroaches scurrying away as he ushered his children into the bathroom to wash their hands.\n“We’re telling our children that we have to constantly wash our hands and use anti-bacterial soaps,” he noted. “How come these species are able to resist or protect themselves against infectious diseases?”\nHis research into what cockroaches have that is protecting them showed that the brain mixture he tested was toxic only to bacteria, not human cells.\nHe wants to bring these anti-bacterial molecules for animal testing, as new anti-bacterial compounds must be designed to cope with antibiotic-resistant strains.\n“We’re heading towards more or less a pre-antibiotic era, where none of the antibiotics will be effective if we don’t come up with novel anti-bacteria,” he said.\nOne of these anti-bacterial defences could even be viruses like bacteriophages, or phages for short, which can live within and attack bacteria. They are bacteria’s natural nemesis.\nAnd over the past two years, microbiologist Wilfried Moreira and his team from the National University of Singapore’s Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine have built one of the largest bacteriophage banks in Southeast Asia.\nWhile phage research became less important after the advent of antibiotics, the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria has led to its comeback.\n“Although Europe and the rest of the world were developing antibiotics, in Georgia and then later on the Soviet Union, bacteriophages have been continuously used for the last 100 years,” Moreira said.\nAt some point, I think every soldier of the Russian army had vials of bacteriophage preparation on them.\nPhages also target specific disease-causing bacteria. “When you use antibiotics, it’s equivalent to carpet bombing. You kill all bacteria indiscriminately, including the very good bacteria,’’ he noted.\n“Bacteriophages are like a sniper shot — they only infect and cure very specific bacteria, and they leave the good bacteria intact and unaffected.”\nWhen bacteria develop resistance to phages, the phages also evolve to become stronger. “We’re also developing what we call genetic engineering capabilities … to basically make (phages) stronger and more efficacious,” Moreira added.\nFIGHTING DENGUE\nOne disease that genetic engineering has shown promise against is dengue.\nMolecular biologist Omar Akbari of the Division of Biological Sciences at the University of California, San Diego, has genetically engineered Aedes aegypti mosquitoes to produce\xa0antibodies to dengue, so that they cannot transmit the virus.\nHe hopes to release the genetically modified mosquitoes into the wild in order to reduce and eventually eradicate dengue transmission.\nUntil now, the primary ways of preventing the spread of dengue have been through insecticides and the elimination of mosquito breeding grounds.\nHowever, William Petrie, the director of Miami-Dade County Mosquito Control and Habitat Management in the United States, said the Aedes aegypti mosquito is now resistant to “almost all conventional insecticides”.\nIn Singapore, the newer solutions being tested include breeding male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes infected with Wolbachia bacteria, which interferes with mosquito reproduction.\nWhen Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes mate with female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, the eggs will not hatch. As the mosquito population falls, eventually dengue infection rates will drop.\n“In areas where we have … high Aedes aegypti mosquito populations, we’ve seen up to a 90 per cent suppression of the mosquito in the community,” cited Project Wolbachia principal investigator Ng Lee Ching from the National Environment Agency.\nSeparately, research by Lok Shee-Mei from the Duke-NUS Medical School’s emerging infectious diseases programme has discovered a reason dengue is hard to vaccinate against: The virus changes shape under different conditions.\nUsing a cryo-electron microscope and 3-D modelling, her team was able to capture images of the virus at different temperatures.\n“For vaccine development, the vaccine is used to train your body’s immune system to recognise (the virus),” said the professor.\n“So you must put (in) all these different structures that it can change into so that your body will be trained to recognise all of them.”\nShape-shifting is not the only complication — dengue also has four serotypes. But the Agency for Science, Technology and Research’s Singapore Immunology Network (SIgN) is in the advanced stages of developing an antibody that is effective against all four serotypes.\nThe antibody attaches to structures on the virus like a “key entering the lock”, said Laurent Renia, the former executive director of SIgN and current executive director of the Infectious Disease Horizontal Technology Centre.\nThis, in turn, triggers the immune system to destroy the virus.\nANTI-MALARIAL EFFORTS\nBesides dengue, mosquitoes transmit malaria through bites from the female anopheles mosquito.\nAlthough the World Health Organisation declared Singapore to be malaria-free in 1982, the disease is prevalent in many countries, and there are tens of cases in the Republic each year, almost all of which are imported.\nSo researcher Pablo Bifani, the principal investigator at SIgN, is testing a new drug that could target multiple stages of plasmodium\xa0vivax, the most widespread malaria parasite, in the human body.\nMany animals also harbour malarial strains, which worries him. “The idea of zoonotic disease is very important now, especially with COVID-19,” he said, pointing out that there is monkey malaria in Singapore.\nAs long as anopheles mosquitoes are still around, malaria could also return to other tropical regions of the developed world that have largely eradicated the disease, said researcher Nick White of the Mahidol Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit in Thailand.\nIn parts of the world, the malaria parasite has become resistant to the anti-malarial drug chloroquine, and alternative drugs such as artemisinin have been developed.\nArtemisinin-based combination therapy\xa0is now used to prevent or mitigate drug-resistant malaria, but the reported evolution of strains that have a multi-drug resistance may hinder its efficacy.\nWith the cost and time involved in inventing more new drugs, Bifani feels that the best way forward for malarial treatment thus lies in the “proper management” of existing drugs.\nWATCH: A bloody fight against mosquito-borne diseases (47:54)\nBACTERIAL KILLERS BY DESIGN\nSometimes, however, chemistry gives new tools to disease hunters.\nFor example, Nanyang Technological University professor Mary Chan and her team have created a bacteria-attacking polymer from a chain of synthetic histidine molecules. Histidine is one of the body’s essential amino acids.\nWhen the positively charged polymer comes into contact with negatively charged bacteria, it is attracted to the surface of the bacteria. Then it penetrates the bacteria’s respiratory pathway, traps the bacterial DNA and other essential molecules, and kills the bacteria.\n“It’s hard for the bacteria to overcome all these multiple targets coming together,” said Chan. “Bacteria can change the charge, but not very easily because it’s a physical characteristic.”\nThe polymer can be programmed to break down into non-toxic parts after it does its work, and the body can release the smaller pieces easily.\nIt was successfully tested on a superbug in a laboratory in Singapore, and there are hopes that it could eventually become a new antibiotic. Its first use could be in diabetic wound dressings and as an anti-bacterial coating on medical devices.\n“Bacteria will always be with us, but we need to kill them with something that’s sustainable and environmentally friendly,” said Chan. “Maybe polymer science is one of the few ways that you can do so.”\nIn the battle against drug-resistant bacteria, viruses and parasites, victory is not guaranteed. But as long as disease hunters come up with innovations, there is a chance of putting new and old illnesses to rest.\nWatch the series Disease Hunters here.\n', 'related_topics': ['     healthcare ', '     science ', '     CNA Insider ']}"

It was first reported to the WHO on Dec 18 after being detected in October, and has since largely replaced other COVID-19 virus strains in South Africa.\nThe variants may not necessarily have originated from the UK and South Africa although they were first detected there. Both are potentially more transmissible but do not seem to cause more severe disease.\xa0\nWHERE HAVE THEY SPREAD?\nB.1.1.7 was responsible for more than 50 per cent of cases in southeast England from October to December and has been detected in more than 50 countries, including Singapore and Malaysia.\nDr Nikki Kanani, Medical Director of Primary Care for NHS England has said that as many as one in 30 people there could be carrying this new variant of COVID-19. The UK has seen case numbers reach record highs even as vaccination has started.\xa0\nThe South Africa virus strain was first discovered in Nelson Mandela Bay on the east coast - then spread rapidly to the south and south east of the country.\nUp to 90 per cent of new cases in the country are carrying the mutant variant, according to health authorities, driving a surge in infections that threatens to overwhelm South Africa’s healthcare system.\nIt has been found in more than 22 territories, including Malaysia, according to cov-lineages.org.\nWHAT’S THE SITUATION IN SINGAPORE?\nSeveral people have now preliminarily tested positive for the B.1.1.7 strain in Singapore.\nThe first case recorded in Singapore, on Dec 24, was a 17-year-old Singaporean woman who had returned from Britain. On Dec 30, a Singapore Airlines pilot and a work pass holder who arrived from the UK also preliminarily tested positive for the B117 strain, MOH said then.\nOn Jan 6, MOH reported that a 24-year-old South Korean man who works at Azur at Crowne Plaza Changi Airport also tested positive for the UK strain. His job was to deliver pre-packed meals to air crew and hotel guests.\nSubsequently, a Singaporean colleague of his – a 20-year-old man - also tested preliminarily positive for the B.1.1.7 strain of the virus. The hotel is now closed until\xa0Jan 21 as a precaution. COVID-19 tests for 234 employees working there all came back negative.\nCNA has contacted the Ministry of Health for more information on the local situation.\nWHAT MAKES THEM MORE TRANSMISSIBLE?\nThe UK and South Africa variants are similar in that they share a common N501Y mutation in the spike protein, which the virus uses to infect cells.\xa0\nThe mutation means they can better bind to human cells – thus making it easier for them to infect us. Studies have shown that the UK variant could be 40 to 70 per cent more transmissible.\nExperts have warned that this means the proportion of the population that needs to be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity will be greater.\nThe South African variant also has two mutations that are absent in the UK variant, says Dr Julian Tang, a clinical virologist at the University of Leicester. One of them - mutation E484K -\xa0has caused concern as it can hinder the action of antibodies against the virus.\nWHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR SINGAPORE?\nIf these variants start to circulate freely in Singapore, there will be a\xa0risk of an accelerated spread of COVID-19 across the community, said Professor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health.\n“This is why it is even more important now than ever, to ensure that we keep up with our personal safe management measures such as proper mask-wearing and social distancing,” he said.\nGiven that Singapore has allowed the resumption of more social activities and larger gatherings, should the variants spread in the country, it is\xa0possible that there will be much faster and broader infection across the community, before contact tracing, isolation and testing protocols can kick in.\xa0\n“However, if people continue to keep up with their measures, the risk of an uncontrolled outbreak in Singapore is still small,” Prof\xa0Teo added.\nProfessor Dale Fisher of Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine at the National University of Singapore said that entry points to Singapore such as\xa0ports and\xa0airports are more vulnerable so these sites need to be ""extra vigilant"".\nSingapore has already imposed more border restrictions such that travellers from the UK and South Africa have to self-isolate for seven days on top of a 14-day stay-home notice at a hotel.\nAll travellers will also need to take\xa0a COVID-19 test on arrival. This will help detect cases earlier and\xa0""offload some risk"" from quarantine hotels, said Prof Fisher.\n""These people would be cared for in hospital or a community care facility and decrease the risk of spread at the quarantine hotels,"" he added.\nDO VACCINES WORK AGAINST THEM?\nProf Teo said that there is the secondary concern that these new variants, or subsequent emerging ones, may be resistant to existing vaccines. This is currently an area of active research.\nPfizer and BioNTech have said that a laboratory study shows that its COVID-19 vaccine works against the key mutation in the new variants of the coronavirus. The COVID-19 vaccine developed by Moderna is also expected to also be effective against the B.1.1.7 variant.\xa0\nThere is a chance that changes in the South African variant may affect the effectiveness of vaccines to some extent but it is\xa0too soon to know for sure, said\xa0scientists. They assure that the vaccines can be modified, if needed, in as little as six weeks.\n“It is entirely possible that there will be future mutated strains that will be resistant to present vaccines. If that is indeed the case, then vaccines will need to be modified continuously and regularly, very much as what we do with influenza vaccines,” said Prof Teo.\nHowever, if the virus becomes more contagious, then more people would need to be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity.\nSaw Swee Hock School of Public Health\'s vice dean of research Associate Professor Alex Cook said that if the new variant is 50 per cent more contagious, then Singapore should probably be aiming for as close to 100 per cent vaccination coverage as possible, within the constraint that some people cannot take the vaccines.\nProf Fisher added: ""These (COVID-19) threats are constant and it’s another reason to vaccinate when given the opportunity.""\nMORE VARIANTS POSSIBLE\nCould new and more dangerous variants arise? Director-General of the WHO Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said that the more the COVID-19 virus spreads, the higher the chance that it will evolve.\n""Most notably, transmissibility of some variant of the virus appears to be increasing. This can drive a surge of cases and hospitalisations,"" he said.\xa0\n""But we need to follow the public health basics now more than ever … You might get fed up of hearing it, but the virus is not fed up with us. Limiting transmission limits the chance of dangerous new variants from developing.""\nBrazil is now also dealing with a new, potentially more contagious, coronavirus variant called P1 that originated in Amazonas and prompted Britain on Thursday to bar entry to Brazilian travellers. This has also been detected in Japan in travellers from Brazil.\xa0\nIf indeed there is an emergence of variants that are resistant to present vaccines, then there is a real risk that the global pandemic will not be that successfully contained by the cocktail of vaccines and community safe management measures, said Prof\xa0Teo.\xa0\n“If that is the case, Singapore will continue to have to maintain strict vigilance on our borders,” he said.\nWhile Singapore has already imposed a longer self-isolation period for incoming travellers from the UK and South Africa,\xa0these border control measures may need to continue to be revised according to the geographical spread of these new variants\xa0and any emerging strains subsequently, he added.\nAssociate Professor of Infection and Immunity Luo Dahai\xa0from Nanyang Technological University\'s Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine said that the COVID-19 pandemic shows no sign of slowing down.\xa0\n“The virus mutates and evolves. The production and distribution of the vaccines are not sufficient and fast enough. There is also strong resistance to the controlling measures and vaccination efforts in certain countries. Singapore is not and cannot go in isolation – so we must remain vigilant,” he said.\nMore than 2,024,656 people have died from the virus across the world, with nearly 95 million cases recorded, according to an AFP tally based on official sources as of Sunday.\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\n', 'related_topics': ['     COVID-19 ', '     health ', '     science ']}"

      Meet the Malaysian enthusiast who builds and launches amateur rockets
  </h1>, 'text': 'KUALA LUMPUR: Growing up watching planes take off and land at Alor Setar airport in the northern Malaysian state\xa0of Kedah left Tan Zu Puayen with a long-standing fascination with aircraft and flight.\nSo much so that he chose to pursue aerospace engineering all the way to a doctorate in the United States and dove into amateur rocketry, building and launching rockets as tall as 5m.\xa0\xa0\nThese amateur,\xa0unmanned rockets are propelled by rocket motors, with some\xa0able to reach an altitude of over 100km above Earth\'s surface - the edge of space - before segmenting and falling back to the ground.\nHis first high-power\xa0rocket, called Boleh One and\xa0measuring at 2.5m, got 600m off the ground in 2011\xa0from the rocket launch site in Alabama.\xa0\n“When I launched Boleh One, the sound of it taking off stuck in my head for weeks after, like a musical earworm.\xa0\n“Rockets don’t actually go ‘woosh’ or ‘pssh’ as they launch. It’s actually more like cracking thunder, you could hear the sound bouncing off the nearby hills,” he recalled.\xa0\nTan\'s interest in aerospace was met with skepticism from his family at first, he recalled.\n“I’d known a couple of family friends who had also done the same field, but they ended up in careers unrelated to their studies, and generally, if you take this field, there aren’t many related jobs in Malaysia,” he said.\xa0\nArriving in America in 2008 was a culture shock at first for Tan, especially when he discovered that aerospace studies was a field one could pursue with the hope of eventually pursuing a career in.\n“That influenced my thinking,” he said.\n\n\nWhen he began studying for his master\'s degree in 2011, he joined an amateur rocketry club at Georgia Institute of Technology called the Ramblin’ Rocket Club and got hooked.\n\xa0In the same year, he embarked on a personal project dubbed Boleh Rockets.\n""Boleh"" is Malay for can, and often evokes the can-do spirit in the context of Malaysia.\xa0\nTo date, Tan has built three\xa0Boleh rockets in the US\xa0and launched them multiple times. He was involved in the launch of a\xa0Low Altitude Demonstrator in Perak last December, a project spearheaded by Singapore-based launcher start-up Equatorial Space Systems (ESS).\xa0\xa0\nCurrently an assistant professor heading the Aerospace Systems and Aerodynamics Research Lab at Taiwan\'s National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Tan has another Boleh rocket in the pipeline - a Boleh Three model which\xa0he wanted to experiment getting off the ground with electrical ducted fans, instead of rocket fuel.\nSUPPORTIVE ROCKETRY ECOSYSTEM IN THE US\nAt its basic, an amateur rocket consists of an outer tube or rocket body to house the motor, which comprises a metal tube or casing and the propellant.\nAnd according to Tan, basic models could be bought quite cheaply from a hobby shop or chain stores like Walmart in the US.\nBeginners could start off by enjoying small, fun models, and as they moved on to more sophisticated ones, rocketry became more difficult and at times, lonely, Tan told CNA.\xa0\n\n\nDespite the supportive rocketry ecosystem in the US, the hobby could also get difficult for hobbyists and enthusiasts, especially for those trying to chase their amateur rocketry qualifications. This is due to cost of materials and the stringent qualification criteria, he said.\xa0\n“But we also feel that a rocket lifting into the sky is a direct metaphor for willpower and resolve, because the rocket punches through the air on raw engine power. It isn’t graceful or compromising with the sky, like an airplane,” Tan mused.\n“I think each launch event, in a way, is us physically manifesting our subconscious resolve to break through challenges. And that’s why we’re addicted to it,” he added.\xa0\nIn the US,\xa0amateur\xa0rocketeers\xa0can obtain three levels of certification through national organisations to progressively fly\xa0more powerful rockets.\xa0\nThe motors of amateur rockets are classed by alphabets, with A to D levels bearing cardboard or plastic casing and H onwards being\xa0high-power rockets. The further along, the more pushing force it has and the longer the motor burns.\xa0\n“So the holy grail of high-power rocketry is from alphabets M to O and beyond, which are under Level Three and are enough to push all the way to the edge of space,” Tan explained.\xa0\nOne reason basic rocketry and amateur rocketry were so accessible to the public in the US, he said, was the presence of an entire supporting ecosystem to encourage children and adults alike to pursue amateur rocketry.\xa0\nThere are\xa0amateur clubs and\xa0national organisations with local chapters in each state.\xa0\n“Meanwhile, research into aerospace studies is well-funded, because you have the United States’ federal government, the corporations putting in money. Not to mention generous involvement from academia, and assistance from private makerspaces and workshops,” Tan\xa0added.\xa0\n\n\nBOLEH ROCKETS LIFTS OFF\nTan\'s Boleh One was launched in 2011 for him\xa0to obtain his Level One\xa0certification in high-power rocketry.\n“For this qualification, I decided to build a model which was taller than I am, with excess capacity\xa0so I could put in a more powerful motor down the road,” he said.\xa0\nThe significance of the successful launch began to sink in after he shared photos and videos of the launch.\n“Friends in Malaysia and other countries were excited by Boleh One’s launch,” he recalled.\xa0\n\n\nOther rockets soon followed, such as Boleh Mini, a smaller rocket with a powerful engine that nearly broke the sound barrier, and Boleh Two\xa0for the highest amateur rocket qualification which he took in 2014.\xa0\n“It was pretty big even by American amateur standards, because it was 5m tall. The whole project cost about US$2,500,” Tan\xa0said.\nBut getting Boleh Two off the ground was also pretty painful, he recalled.\n“Both in terms of funding and the physical work, because you had to spend hours bent over, wrapping fibreglass around the cardboard tubes by hand for reinforcement,” he said.\xa0\nMoreover, due to Boleh Two’s large size, carrying it anywhere, and even to the launch site in Talladega, Alabama,\xa0and setting it up was an ordeal.\n“Having the first launch attempt scrubbed\xa0because the launch rail attachment didn’t fit right was devastating; all that effort and money riding on the success or failure of one minute of flight was nerve-wracking,” he said.\n“So when Boleh Two successfully launched and recovered, I remember the sunlight became unusually bright and warm on the drive back. That was weird,” Tan\xa0said.\nIt is not cheap to launch amateur rockets and Tan said it was lucky that his tuition was waived and he also earned a small stipend for university work.\xa0\n""So if you save a bit on your transport, eating out and other luxuries, funding rocket projects is entirely feasible,"" he said.\nTan considered\xa0his rockets ""Malaysian rockets""\xa0because they were Malaysian-built and funded.\xa0\n“That one (Boleh Two) opened up a lot of conversations and opportunities to collaborate, even more than my university transcripts,” he said.\xa0\n\n\nPAST AND FUTURE COLLABORATIONS\nTan’s interest in rocketry has led\xa0to interesting collaborations, the latest being\xa0Boleh Rockets’ involvement in a\xa0Low Altitude Demonstrator test launch at an oil palm estate in Perak last December.\nThe event was a joint collaboration of ESS,\xa0Universiti Teknologi MARA and MTC Engineering Sdn Bhd\xa0to\xa0demonstrate\xa0the efficacy of\xa0ESS\'s hybrid rocket motor that used the start-up\'s proprietary fuel formula.\nTan provided consulting on the rocket’s aerodynamics and balance, as well as helped with the performance analysis.\xa0It was launched to an altitude of 1.2km.\xa0\n\n\n\nBoleh Rockets currently functions on a non-profit basis, and according to Tan,\xa0he has further collaborations down the line. Some are not exactly related to rocketry.\nThis August, for instance, Tan’s university lab, along with his university’s Aero-Tech lab, also run by another Malaysian academic, will be collaborating with Universiti Sains Malaysia’s High Altitude Balloon Team on a project called “Mission Reconnect 2020”.\xa0\nThe high-altitude balloon mission, which started out with technical objectives, also encompasses a social aspect.\n“Aside from testing out a light-weight camera system, the balloon capsule design team primarily comprised tertiary-level students guided by the two labs.\n“We tentatively plan to conduct outreach efforts, such as space workshops with Taiwan or Malaysian primary and secondary schools,"" Tan said. Suggested events included\xa0competitions to fly small experiments with the team or art projects to inspire further interest among schoolchildren.\xa0\n“And the mission name is such to symbolically ‘reverse’ last year’s isolation that COVID-19 inflicted on us,” he added.\xa0\nTan recalled when he\xa0wanted to study aerospace engineering back then, both he and his family approached the field from a position of\xa0unfamiliarity.\nThere was scepticism and constant corrections along the way, but eventually they reached a point\xa0where his family not only stopped questioning, but grew to accept his point of view on his studies.\n“As for Boleh Rockets and my current career, their thinking is that ‘Hey, not only might this work, but you might actually have something to contribute in the aerospace field,’” he said with a laugh.\n\n\n“So now, an aerospace career is my rice bowl, and the practical and aspirational aspects of a career in aerospace are both realised, their thinking is ‘Why not?’” Tan added.\n“In the US, it was an effort advancing my personal rocket. As a professor now, it becomes an effort to create the opportunity for others, including my students, to fly while also continuing to fly myself,” he said.\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     Malaysia ', '     rocket ', '     science ']}"

      Children have stronger antibody response to COVID-19: Study
  </h1>, 'text': 'WASHINGTON: Children who are 10 and younger produce more antibodies in response to coronavirus infection than adolescents and adults, a study showed on Monday (Mar 22).\nThe authors of the paper, which appeared in JAMA Network Open, said the finding helped illuminate why children are less susceptible to severe COVID-19 than adults - though this is still an area of very active research and many factors are believed to be at play.\nA team led by researchers at Weill Cornell Medicine examined almost 32,000 antibody tests from New York City between April and August 2020, finding that a similar number of the 1,200 children and 30,000 adults showed signs of past infection -\xa017 per cent and 19 per cent.\nThe scientists then examined a subset of patients who tested positive - 85 children and 3,648 adults - to determine the levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies.\nThis is a key type of ""neutralising"" antibody that binds to the spike protein of the virus, preventing it from invading cells.\nThe 32 children aged 1 to 10 years showed median IgG levels almost five times higher than 127 young adults aged 19 to 24 years.\nFinally, they focused on a subset of 126 positive patients aged 1 to 24 years, none of whom had experienced severe COVID-19, to further characterise the antibody response.\nIn this final group, children aged 1 to 10 years had on average more than twice the levels of IgG antibodies of adolescents aged 11 to 18 years, who in turn had more than twice the average level of young adults aged 19 to 24 years.\nThe authors wrote: ""Our findings suggest that the differences in clinical manifestations of COVID-19 in paediatric patients compared with adult patients could be partly due to age-related immune response.""\nThe fact that children are less prone to severe COVID-19 is in some ways counter-intuitive, given how much they are affected by other respiratory illnesses, and many theories abound.\nA paper in Nature Communications last month by researchers in Australia suggested children have a more active ""innate"" immunity - the immune system\'s first line of defence, which gets triggered before it raises antibodies, and involves cells such as neutrophils that patrol the body looking for infections.\nAnother theory is linked to the fact that children have fewer cell receptors in their respiratory tracts called ""ACE2"" which the coronavirus uses to gain entry to our cells.\nOne paradoxical result from the new research was that antibody levels were lowest for young adults but rose again with age - despite the fact that we know older people are more vulnerable.\nThe authors admitted they could not completely explain this and suggested the reason for higher hospitalisation and death rates among the elderly could relate to higher rates of comorbidities.\nObesity, which is a major risk factor for severe COVID-19, is associated with a phenomenon called ""cytokine storm"" where the immune system goes into overdrive, damaging organs.\nThe fact that obese people have a higher baseline level of the signalling proteins called cytokines could also be associated with heightened antibody production, the authors wrote.\n', 'related_topics': ['     COVID-19 ', '     health ', '     science ']}"

      NTU scientists transform discarded durian husks into antibacterial gel bandages
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: Discarded durian husks could soon have a second life – as antibacterial hydrogel bandages.\nThe bandages, created by Nanyang Technological University (NTU) scientists, were developed in line with Singapore's push towards zero waste, said\xa0Professor William Chen on Thursday (Mar 25).\nProf Chen, the director of NTU's Food Science and Technology Programme,\xa0is the scientist behind the durian husk project.\n“Twelve million durians are consumed every year. However, most of the durian fruit is discarded,” he said.\xa0\nThe husk, which comprises about 60 per cent of the durian, is usually discarded and incinerated, “posing an environmental issue”, said NTU in a media release.\nThe low-cost bandage is both biodegradable and non-toxic, which means it has a smaller environmental footprint than conventional synthetic bandages, the university said.\nMAKING THE BANDAGE\nProf Chen and his team created the bandages by extracting high-quality cellulose from the durian husks. They converted the husks into cellulose\xa0powder through slicing, freeze-drying and ball-milling, before removing impurities.\nThis is a “significant reduction” in cost compared to traditional methods of using enzymes, said Prof Chen. The traditional method costs about S$27,000 per kg, while Prof Chen’s method costs about S$120 per kg to extract the same amount of cellulose.\nAfter extracting the cellulose, researchers combined the extract with glycerol –\xa0a waste by-product from the biodiesel and soap industry –\xa0to make a soft gel. The gel, which is similar to silicon sheets, can be cut into bandages of various shapes and sizes.\xa0\nThe scientists then added organic molecules produced from baker’s yeast, making the bandages deadly to bacteria.\nThe bandages remain functional in extreme weather conditions, added Prof Chen.\nHe estimates that he can extract 200g of husk powder from a 3kg durian, of which 40g is pure cellulose. This 40g is enough to make 66 pieces of 7cm by 7cm hydrogel, which is enough material for about 1,600 plasters measuring 1cm by 2cm each.\nWHY HYDROGEL?\nThere are various applications for hydrogels, including wound dressing and wearable electronics, said Prof Chen.\xa0\nAbout 80 to 90 per cent of hydrogel\xa0is water, said Associate Professor Andrew Tan, who was invited to Thursday’s media briefing as an independent expert. He is vice dean (faculty) at NTU’s Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine.\nIt is “well-established” in many clinical trials that hydrogel\xa0helps\xa0wounds to heal, added Assoc Prof Tan. For instance, the water keeps the wound area cool and moist, accelerating healing. Hydrogel also reduces\xa0scarring.\nWhile durians were not the only possible choice to make these bandages, Prof Chen said he chose the fruit as there was “sustainable supply” and it was high in fibre content.\nHowever, he noted that this was platform technology, and the method of extracting cellulose can be used on other materials.\nCHEAPER THAN CONVENTIONAL HYDROGEL PATCHES\nAccording to Prof Chen, conventional hydrogel patches on the market are made of synthetic materials. Those with antimicrobial properties use metallic compounds like silver or copper ions.\nThese materials make conventional hydrogel patches more costly than Prof Chen’s hydrogel, which is made from natural waste materials.\nA typical hurdle for university research to market is scalability and cost-reduction, said Prof Chen. So it was important to keep the process simple, low-cost and green, he added.\nThe durian husks are low in cost\xa0and Prof Chen’s extraction method\xa0–\xa0which uses environmentally friendly detergent – is simple, so the project could be scaled up for production, he said.\nAlthough currently just a proof of concept, if cellulose can be extracted in a sustainable\xa0and cost-effective\xa0way, then there is “great potential” for the durian husk-based hydrogel to replace current hydrogels already on the market, Prof Chen said.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     environment ', '     science ', '     technology ', '     NTU ']}"

  </h1>, 'text': 'REUTERS: A college science professor and an aerospace data analyst were named on Tuesday to round out a four-member crew for a SpaceX launch into orbit planned later this year billed as the first all-civilian spaceflight in history.\nThe two latest citizen astronauts were introduced at a news briefing livestreamed from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida by SpaceX human spaceflight chief Benji Reed and billionaire entrepreneur Jared Isaacman, who conceived the mission in part as a charity drive.\nIsaacman, founder and CEO of e-commerce firm Shift4 Payments, is forking over an unspecified but presumably exorbitant sum to fellow billionaire and SpaceX owner Elon Musk to fly himself and three others into orbit aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule.\nThe flight, scheduled for no earlier than Sept. 15, is expected to last three to four days from launch to splashdown.\n""When this mission is complete, people are going to look at it and say this was the first time that everyday people could go to space,"" Isaacman, 38, told reporters.\nDubbed Inspiration4, the mission is designed primarily to raise awareness and support for one of Isaacman\'s favorite causes, St. Jude Children\'s Research Hospital, a leading pediatric cancer center.

Google and Volvo did not immediately respond to emailed requests for comment.\nSouth Korea\'s Samsung SDI said it was the first battery maker to participate in WWF\'s initiative.\nIn the meantime, deep-sea mining companies are pushing ahead with preparatory work and research on seabed licence areas.\nCompanies that hold exploration licences for swathes of the sea floor, including DeepGreen, GSR and UK Seabed Resources - a subsidiary of Lockheed Martin\'s UK-based arm - hope to eventually sell minerals from the seabed to carmakers and battery companies.\nDeepGreen, which recently announced plans to go public in a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), has previously said seabed mining will be more sustainable than mining on land because it creates less waste and the nodules containing minerals have higher concentrations of metals than deposits found on land.\nMeanwhile Norway has said it could license companies for deep-sea mining as early as 2023, potentially placing it among the first countries to harvest seabed metals.\n(Reporting by Helen Reid; Editing by Amran Abocar and Kenneth Maxwell)\n', 'related_topics': ['     Google ', '     science ', '     BMW ']}"

      GOP lawmakers slam EPA chief over firing of science advisers
  </h1>, 'text': ""WASHINGTON: Two House Republicans are demanding that the Environmental Protection Agency provide records related to a decision by the agency's new leader to remove dozens of scientists and other experts from two key advisory boards.\nEPA Administrator Michael Regan has said the advisers appointed under the Trump administration were overly friendly to business and that his Mar 31 “reset” of the Science Advisory Board and Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee would return EPA to its practice of relying on advice from a balanced group of experts.\nRegan’s overhaul removed more than 45 members of the two science advisory boards, including some whose terms do not expire this year. The panels provide scientific expertise and recommendations for air quality standards and other policies intended to protect public health and the environment.\nBut GOP Reps. James Comer of Kentucky and Ralph Norman of South Carolina criticised Regan for what they called an unwarranted “purge” based more on politics than science. Comer is the senior Republican on the House Oversight Committee, while Norman is the top Republican on the panel’s environment subcommittee.\n“Traditionally science advisory boards are bipartisan panels used to provide advice to the administrator. Unfortunately, it appears the Biden administration is continuing to purge officials in the government who do not share its political beliefs,'' Comer and Norman wrote Wednesday in a letter  to Regan.\n“The midterm firing of science advisory board members within the first months of a new administration .... raises serious concerns about the politicisation of the EPA,” they added.\nRegan told The Associated Press in an interview late last month that while he was clearing out the two important panels, ousted members can apply for reinstatement.\n“Scientific integrity is a foundational value for EPA,″ Regan said. “And I am committing to ensuring that every single decision we make meets rigorous scientific standards.’’\nDemocrats have said a 2017 decision by Donald Trump’s first EPA administrator, Scott Pruitt, to remove many academic scientists from the advisory panels tilted them in favor of the chemical and fossil fuel industries.\xa0\nPruitt barred scientists from serving on the advisory boards if they had received EPA research grants. Pruitt later resigned amid ethics scandals but his policies were largely continued under his successor and former deputy, Andrew Wheeler.\nJohn Graham, the former chairman of the Science Advisory Board, said last week that Regan’s “radical action″ disrupted his service and that of every board member. The Indiana University professor said he will not reapply “because I respectfully protest the entire process that Administrator Regan has concocted.″\nRegan, 44, was sworn in Mar\xa011 as the first Black man to run the EPA. He served as North Carolina’s top environmental regulator for four years before that and also worked at the EPA during the Clinton and Bush administrations.\nHe told the AP that the reset of the two advisory boards -\xa0and the removal of all members of both boards -\xa0“are indicative of how serious we are about repairing the scientific integrity at EPA.″\nThe EPA also will be part of a White House effort to investigate Trump-era political interference in science across the executive branch, Regan said.\nIn their letter, Comer and Norman asked the EPA to provide by Apr\xa021 all documents and communications -\xa0including any with the White House - from Jan\xa020 on related to the ouster of the advisory board members.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     news and politics ', '     science ']}"

      Scientists get creative to carry on research during COVID-19 pandemic
  </h1>, 'text': 'SAN LORENZO: Biologist Claudio Monteza pushed through thick vegetation to install a camera near a Panamanian highway in a dense tropical rainforest. Securing the device to a tree just off the forest floor, he checked its field of vision.\nThe camera and others were set up to provide insights into which animals steer clear of highways and which ones are more apt to check them out. The findings could someday help transportation officials better protect wildlife in one of the world\'s most biologically diverse environments.\nBut the highway study “was not the initial plan"",\xa0said Monteza, whose career was upended last year when COVID-19 stranded him in his native Panama and suspended his research. Because of the pandemic, many scientists ""have had to innovate and look for alternatives.”\nThe coronavirus abruptly halted research by many Latin American scientists, interrupting field work, sample collection and laboratory experiments. Some of them could focus on writing scholarly articles based on previous research, but others had to get creative to avoid losing a year of their careers.\nMonteza had just finished a master’s degree in the United States when he stopped in Panama for a few days before a planned flight to Germany to begin his doctoral studies. Then the world began shutting down. He started taking doctoral classes virtually.\nAfter governments adopted strict quarantine measures, Monteza concluded that one way to get permission for research was to look at highways because they could be studied without significant travel.\nOther scientists hauled samples of marine sediment and lab equipment or even entire ant colonies into their homes. One researcher, barred from capturing bats to bring to her laboratory, mounted cameras that allowed her to spy on their sexual habits in the wild.\nOn a recent day, after installing one camera, Monteza pushed about 50 yards deeper into the forest. Field biologist Pedro Castillo helped him install another camera just as heavy raindrops began to fall. In minutes, both men were soaked, but the opportunity to get into the field was a relief.\nMonteza believes the highway research could help push authorities to create wildlife crossings for armadillos, the rodents known as lowland pacas and agoutis, and other animals.\nDuring the first half of 2020, when Panama was under an absolute quarantine, scientists had almost “zero mobility, said Erick Núñez, head of the Panama Environmental Ministry’s biodiversity department. ""There was very little research.”\nLater, the Health Ministry began to loosen restrictions and granted passes to some scientists who planned to work in protected areas alone or in small groups, Núñez said.\nResearcher Brígida De Gracia of the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute was lucky to be able to work from home. She had collected sediment samples in 2018, 2019 and January 2020 that allowed her to continue her research during the pandemic.\nBut to do so, De Gracia took the samples, a stereoscope, vials, a scale and many books home from her lab in Naos, near where the Panama Canal meets the Pacific Ocean.\nDe Gracia studies otoliths, tiny stone-like structures in the ears of many vertebrates. In particular, she studies them in fish to see how humans have affected fish over the past several thousand years.\n“You have to store them very carefully,” because they’re so tiny that even a light breeze can move them, said De Gracia, who analyzed and photographed the otoliths at home.\nBefore the coronavirus arrived, Mariana Muñoz-Romo, a post-doctoral researcher at the Smithsonian, had planned to capture a large sample of bats from different places around the Panamanian town of Gamboa, but the suspension of research activities made that impossible.\nSo she adjusted. Instead of catching bats to take back to a lab, Muñoz-Romo shifted to observing the bats’ sex lives in their own habitat. She hopes to discover the purpose of a strong-smelling substance on the forearms of the fringe-lipped bat.\nHer mentor was able to get permits to install video cameras and other devices in a bat sanctuary in Gamboa. They started recording in mid-2020 and plan to continue for several more months.\n“Analyzing these recordings is fabulous because you can generate a mountain of information,” said Muñoz-Romo, a Venezuelan who is a professor at the University of the Andes in Merida, Venezuela.\nWhen the pandemic closed his laboratory in Gamboa, Dumas Gálvez moved dozens of colonies of ants to his home in Paraiso. He wanted to continue observing them as part of his research into their immune systems.\nBefore the pandemic, that required many hours in his lab analyzing their blood and how they responded to attacking fungi.\n“I had to look for alternatives,” Gálvez said. “And one of the alternatives was initially to do it in my house.”\nGálvez outfitted an extra bathroom to hold up to 100 ant colonies. His largest colonies were around 200 ants, so he had an estimated 13,000 ants in his home.\nHe observed their lives and reactions for months, but over time they began to die. Exactly why was not clear. It was either because of the fungus or excessive heat, he said.\n“The conditions in the bathroom were not optimal,"" he said. ""It was very hot. They dried quickly.”\nThe pandemic prevented him from going out to collect more ants, so he shifted his focus and is now studying the interaction of ants and a small predatory frog.\nPanama has since eased its pandemic restrictions, and the Smithsonian is reopening its facilities there. Gálvez has been able to resume field work and supervising students.\n“If not for the pandemic, I wouldn’t have invested the energy in considering alternatives,” he said. “I probably would not have ever done this project.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     science ', '     Pandemic ', '     COVID-19 ']}"

Grossi had hoped to report progress before the board meets again next week.\n""The Director General is concerned that the technical discussions between the Agency and Iran have not yielded the expected results,"" the report said.\n""The lack of progress in clarifying the Agency\'s questions concerning the correctness and completeness of Iran\'s safeguards declarations seriously affects the ability of the Agency to provide assurance of the peaceful nature of Iran\'s nuclear programme,"" it added.\nIn a separate quarterly report also sent to member states on Monday and seen by Reuters, the agency gave an indication of the damage done to Iran\'s production of enriched uranium by an explosion and power cut at its Natanz site last month that Tehran has blamed on Israel.\nIran\'s quarterly increase in its stock of enriched uranium was the lowest since August 2019 at just 273kg, bringing the total to 3,241kg, according to an IAEA estimate. It was not able to fully verify the stock because Iran has downgraded cooperation.\nThat total is many times the 202.8kg limit set by the nuclear deal, but still well below the more than six tonnes Iran possessed before the deal.\nDAMAGE TO NATANZ\nAt Iran\'s main enrichment plant, which is underground at Natanz, the agency verified on May 24 that 20 cascades, or clusters, of different types of centrifuges were being fed with uranium hexafluoride feedstock for enrichment. A senior diplomat said that before the explosion that figure was 35-37.\nAfter Washington pulled out of the nuclear deal in 2018 under President Donald Trump and re-imposed crippling economic sanctions against Tehran, Iran began breaching the deal\'s restrictions on its nuclear activities as of 2019.\nOne of its more recent breaches, enriching uranium to 60 per cent, a big step towards weapons-grade from the 20 per cent\xa0it had previously reached and the deal\'s 3.67 per cent\xa0limit, continued. The IAEA estimated that Iran had produced 2.4kg of uranium enriched to that level and 62.8kg of uranium enriched to up to 20 per cent.\nIran\'s production of experimental quantities of uranium metal, which is prohibited under the deal and has prompted protests by Western powers because of its potential use in the core of nuclear weapons, also continued.

  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: When COVID-19 hit Singapore early last year, local start-up Breathonix had to stop all its clinical trials for its lung cancer breathalyser test due to pandemic restrictions.\nThe company\'s CEO Dr Jia Zhunan had been working on a way to detect disease from a person\'s breath since her days as a doctoral student.\nBut although tests for lung cancer detection had to stop, the firm soon found a new\xa0purpose - a breath test for COVID-19.\nIt was a ""natural"" switch because no other clinical trials were allowed at the time, and there was a lot of interest in a quick way to detect the highly infectious coronavirus,\xa0said Breathonix\'s business development and strategy head\xa0Wayne Wee.\n""The technology, the hardware, even the know-how is the same,"" the 26-year-old told CNA.\xa0""It\'s just collecting a different set of data.""\nOn May 24, Breathonix announced that its COVID-19 breath analysis system was the first to secure provisional\xa0authorisation in Singapore.\n\n\nThis came a week before Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said in a national address that COVID-19\xa0testing must be done “faster, and more liberally and extensively”.\xa0\nMany different tests have become available, such as antigen rapid tests (ART), saliva tests and\xa0breathalysers, Mr Lee noted then, adding that\xa0DIY tests will also be sold at pharmacies.\nTRIALS SPEEDED UP\nBreathonix\xa0is supported by the National University of Singapore’s (NUS) Graduate Research Innovation Programme.\nAround mid-2020, the company started a small study with the National Centre of Infectious Diseases (NCID), and the accuracy was high enough for them to expand it to a larger trial.\nAs with many innovations linked to COVID-19, what might have taken three years or more was then compressed into one year - with clinical trials and regulatory approvals speeded up.\nAnd the firm did it all on a budget of less than S$1 million, said Mr Wee.\n""It was quite a steep learning curve for us - (as it was our)\xa0first time doing all these things ...\xa0we tried to seek consulting help from NUS. And if that\'s not enough, we had to source for or hire\xa0some experts to join the team,"" he added.\nThey also had a lot of help from\xa0stakeholders like the Ministry of Health and NCID, said Mr Wee.\nRather than having a swab thrust up your nose,\xa0a COVID-19 test using the company\'s BreFence\xa0Go COVID-19 breath test system takes just one breath.\nThe exhaled breath then passes into a mass spectrometer, and the breath is analysed for\xa0volatile organic compounds (VOC) or biomarkers that indicate COVID-19 infection.\nThe trick, says Mr Wee, is to figure out what VOCs to look for and what to ignore. For example, smokers or people who have consumed alcohol would emit certain VOCs, which the analysis would omit.\nIt currently has an accuracy of 85.7 per cent\xa0sensitivity and 97 per cent\xa0specificity - correctly identifying those without the disease. Clinical trials are ongoing with an algorithm with artificial intelligence\xa0to further improve accuracy.\nThe World Health Organization\xa0(WHO) recommends\xa0a sensitivity of 80 per cent\xa0and specificity of 97 per cent\xa0for rapid antigen tests (ART), while the gold standard for COVID-19 tests remains the polymerase chain reaction or PCR test.\nBoth ART and PCR tests require nasal swabs.\xa0While ART tests can produce results in 30 minutes, it may take a day for PCR tests.\xa0\xa0\n""LESS THAN A SECOND TO PROCESS""\nAccording to Mr Wee, their breath test takes only 40 to 60 seconds,\xa0which eliminates the need for a holding area while people wait for test results.\n""Once we capture the data from the breath, the analysis of our own algorithm takes less than a second to process ...\xa0We are able to give the results in real-time to the person on the spot,"" he said.\xa0\n""If you\'re\xa0tested negative, you are cleared to go ... If you\'re tested positive, you will be redirected to take the PCR test and then you\'ll be isolated or quarantined.""\nAnother advantage is that the test\xa0can be conducted by trained non-medical\xa0staff members.\nA pilot deployment at Tuas Checkpoint started on May 31 and is still ongoing. The machine is\xa0placed at different locations at the checkpoint to see if it is\xa0suited for use in such an environment.\nFor example, the team\xa0thought that strong winds or\xa0car fumes may affect the test results, but\xa0the performance so far has been ""quite promising"", said Mr Wee.\nBeyond Singapore, Breathonix is looking at other countries, including Malaysia and Vietnam, for more trials. It has already\xa0conducted trials at Changi Airport, as well as in Dubai, and are seeking approval in the United Arab Emirates.\nIt hopes to get full approval from Singapore\'s Health Sciences Authority by the end of the year.\nEach test costs US$5 to US$20, depending on the volume of the deployment, which is much cheaper than PCR tests, said Mr Wee.\nIt is thus useful for venues with high traffic like large events, schools, worker dormitories or workplaces where routine testing is done.\n""Our bigger vision is really to make breath tests (an) annual screening tool for every single individual,"" said Mr Wee.\n""On top of doing a blood test and other\xa0tests, you also do a breath test, where we are able to detect and\xa0identify if you are at risk of any disease ... such as lung cancer, nose cancer, tuberculosis, maybe even flu.""\n\n\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\n', 'related_topics': ['     COVID-19 ', '     science ']}"

      Exclusive: Google searches for new measure of skin tones to curb bias in products
  </h1>, 'text': 'REUTERS: Alphabet Inc\'s Google told Reuters this week it is developing an alternative to the industry standard method for classifying skin tones, which a growing chorus of technology researchers and dermatologists says is inadequate for assessing whether products are biased against people of color.\nAt issue is a six-color scale known as Fitzpatrick Skin Type (FST), which dermatologists have used since the 1970s. Tech companies now rely on it to categorize people and measure whether products such as facial recognition systems or smartwatch heart-rate sensors perform equally well across skin tones.\nCritics say FST, which includes four categories for ""white"" skin and one apiece for ""black"" and ""brown,"" disregards diversity among people of color. Researchers at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, during a federal technology standards conference https://cdnapisec.kaltura.com/index.php/extwidget/preview/partner_id/684682/uiconf_id/31013851/entry_id/1_e8yesv2x/embed/dynamic#t=1:57:30 last October, recommended abandoning FST for evaluating facial recognition because it poorly represents color range in diverse populations.\nIn response to Reuters\' questions about FST, Google, for the first time and ahead of peers, said that it has been quietly pursuing better measures.\n""We are working on alternative, more inclusive, measures that could be useful in the development of our products, and will collaborate with scientific and medical experts, as well as groups working with communities of color,"" the company said, declining to offer details on the effort.\nThe controversy is part of a larger reckoning over racism and diversity in the tech industry, where the workforce is more white than in sectors like finance. Ensuring technology works well for all skin colors, as well different ages and genders, is assuming greater importance as new products, often powered by artificial intelligence (AI), extend into sensitive and regulated areas such as healthcare and law enforcement.\nCompanies know their products can be faulty for groups that are under-represented in research and testing data. The concern over FST is that its limited scale for darker skin could lead to technology that, for instance, works for golden brown skin but fails for espresso red tones.\nNumerous types of products offer palettes far richer than FST. Crayola last year launched 24 skin tone crayons, and Mattel Inc\'s Barbie Fashionistas dolls this year cover nine tones.\nThe issue is far from academic for Google. When the company announced in February that cameras on some Android phones could measure pulse rates via a fingertip, it said https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scahO3HtMOM readings on average would err by 1.8per cent regardless of whether users had light or dark skin.\nThe company later gave similar https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A32_1Dwuh8JmmilCvKwosgQJj8M1Q3kT/view warranties that skin type would not noticeably affect results of a feature for filtering backgrounds on Meet video conferences, nor of an upcoming web tool for identifying skin conditions, informally dubbed Derm Assist https://blog.google/technology/health/ai-dermatology-preview-io-2021.\nThose conclusions derived from testing with the six-tone FST.\n\'STARTING POINT\'\nThe late Harvard University dermatologist Dr. Thomas Fitzpatrick https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/fullarticle/479610 invented the scale to personalize ultraviolet radiation treatment for psoriasis, an itchy skin condition. He grouped the skin of ""white"" people as Roman numerals I to IV by asking how much sunburn or tan they developed after certain periods in sun.\nA decade later came type V for ""brown"" skin and VI for ""black."" The scale is still part of U.S. regulations for testing sunblock products, and it remains a popular dermatology standard for assessing patients\' cancer risk and more.\nSome dermatologists say the scale is a poor and overused measure for care, and often conflated with race and ethnicity.\n""Many people would assume I am skin type V, which rarely to never burns, but I burn,"" said Dr. Susan Taylor, a University of Pennsylvania dermatologist who founded Skin of Color Society in 2004 to promote research on marginalized communities. ""To look at my skin hue and say I am type V does me disservice.""\nTechnology companies, until recently, were unconcerned. Unicode, an industry association overseeing emojis, referred to FST in 2014 as its basis for adopting five skin tones beyond yellow, saying http://www.unicode.org/L2/L2014/14213-skin-tone-mod.pdf the scale was ""without negative associations.""\nA 2018 study titled ""Gender Shades,"" https://proceedings.mlr.press/v81/buolamwini18a/buolamwini18a.pdf which found facial analysis systems more often misgendered people with darker skin, popularized using FST for evaluating AI. The research described FST as a ""starting point,"" but scientists of similar studies that came later told Reuters they used the scale to stay consistent.\n""As a first measure for a relatively immature market, it serves its purpose to help us identify red flags,"" said Inioluwa Deborah Raji, a Mozilla fellow focused on auditing AI.\nIn an April study https://scontent-sjc3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.8562-6/166944269_1101759557004334_1049316558312568671_n.pdf testing AI for detecting deepfakes, Facebook Inc researchers wrote FST ""clearly does not encompass the diversity within brown and black skin tones."" Still, they released videos of 3,000 individuals to be used for evaluating AI systems, with FST tags attached based on the assessments of eight human raters.\nThe judgment of the raters is central. Facial recognition software startup AnyVision last year gave celebrity examples https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.07838.pdf to raters: former baseball great Derek Jeter as a type IV, model Tyra Banks a V and rapper 50 Cent a VI.\nAnyVision told Reuters it agreed with Google\'s decision to revisit use of FST, and Facebook said it is open to better measures.\nMicrosoft Corp and smartwatch makers Apple Inc and Garmin Ltd reference FST when working on health-related sensors.\nBut use of FST could be fueling ""false assurances"" about heart rate readings from smartwatches on darker skin, University of California San Diego clinicians, inspired by the Black Lives Matter social equality movement, wrote in the journal Sleep https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/43/10/zsaa159/5902283 last year.\nMicrosoft acknowledged FST\'s imperfections. Apple said it tests on humans across skin tones using various measures, FST only at times among them. Garmin said due to wide-ranging testing it believes readings are reliable.\nVictor Casale, who founded makeup company Mob Beauty and helped Crayola on the new crayons, said he developed 40 shades for foundation, each different from the next by about 3per cent, or enough for most adults to distinguish.\nColor accuracy on electronics suggest tech standards should have 12 to 18 tones, he said, adding, ""you can\'t just have six.""\n(Reporting by Paresh Dave; Editing by Jonathan Weber and Lisa Shumaker)\n', 'related_topics': ['     Google ', '     science ']}"

      Why the dengue fever caseload has plummeted in parts of Southeast Asia this year
  </h1>, 'text': 'BANGKOK: Underreporting from strained medical systems and extensive social lockdowns could explain why many Southeast Asian countries have recorded substantially fewer cases of dengue fever in 2021 than previous years, said experts.\nData from the World Health Organization (WHO) suggests that several countries are enjoying vastly improved dengue fever situations this year, including Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, Cambodia and Laos.\nOther nations, including Singapore and Vietnam are experiencing dengue cases on par with seasonal expectations, according to WHO.\n\n\nDengue fever is a potentially deadly disease spread by infected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. The populations of these mosquitoes typically rapidly increase in the pre-monsoon period and monsoon season, as humidity, temperature and rainfall rise. Its alternative name is “breakbone fever”, due to the associated muscle and joint pain symptoms.\nWhile there is consensus that 2021 is not a bad year for dengue fever infections in the region, especially compared to 2019, the statistics may not necessarily reflect the true nature of the spread of the disease.\n“I think there’s a number of things at play here. One is people aren’t going to medical centres with fever in the same way they would normally, because of COVID,”\xa0said Martin Hibberd, a professor of emerging infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.\n“Secondly, the health centres are not in their normal responsive mode. Their priorities are elsewhere and they’re not testing as much as they would. So the numbers reported must be less,” he told CNA.\nA WHO spokesperson did not identify any clear evidence for why dengue cases were declining but said there could be several possible reasons, including more proactive vector control, stronger national surveillance systems and better communication with the community.\nAs well, the overwhelming demands of handling the COVID-19 pandemic might have seen dengue monitoring drop to a lesser priority in some places, the spokesperson\xa0said in response to CNA\'s queries.\xa0\n“Unfortunately, COVID-19 has impacted a range of routine health-related programmes in many countries.\xa0\n“Detection and reporting of dengue cases are also believed to have been impacted by reduced access to health facilities, and a hesitancy to seek medical care at facilities due to concern of possible exposure to COVID-19 patients,” the spokesperson added.\nLOCKDOWN IMPACTS\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic hit early last year, many experts had hypothesised that social lockdowns and people spending extended periods of time at home would result in an uptick of dengue. The statistics suggest that the opposite may have been true.\n“The perceived wisdom is that dengue infections happen at home; your mosquitoes live\xa0in the house. We thought if more people stayed at home there would be more dengue but that’s clearly not the case,” Hibberd said.\n“There might be a little bit of local migration, but it could be that outside of home plays a more important part in dengue transmission than we thought. Maybe your workplace or your school or your other places have been important contributors of dengue transmission in the past.”\xa0\nWHO concurred, noting that lesser movements could have actually decreased people’s exposure to mosquitoes.\nDr Rafdzah Ahmad Zaki, a senior lecturer in Epidemiology at the University of Malaya believes the COVID-19 lockdowns in Malaysia have had a strong effect in slowing the spread of the disease.\n“A significant reduction of cases were seen during the implementation of full lockdown,” she said, noting that people spending time at home meant fewer outdoor hosts for mosquitoes to make contact with, and less human waste reduced breeding sites.\nBecause the initial symptoms of both COVID-19 and dengue are similar, she doubts that patients would willingly avoid medical treatment even if they were scared of the pandemic, a factor that otherwise could contribute to the reduced recorded case numbers.“I would think that the shifting priorities and resources of the health system to COVID-19 would more likely increase the number of cases. With the current situation, people who are concerned with their health will seek health advice and early treatment,” she said.\nLINK BETWEEN CLIMATE CHANGE AND DENGUE TRANSMISSION?\nFactors such as increasing urbanisation, unplanned high-density housing, inefficient mosquito control and normal levels of international travel and trade were\xa0cited by the WHO as reasons for dengue spread. But it downplayed the role of climate change.\n“While the relationship between dengue incidence and climate change have been extensively studied globally, no clear evidence has been demonstrated. Besides, dengue transmission is closely associated with various socio-environmental factors as well as climate change,” the WHO spokesperson said.\nBut Hibberd disagrees. “Climate change is definitely going to affect dengue cases. It’s only a matter of time before it spreads,” he said.\nClimate change is already starting to shift the geographies of possible future dengue spread. As the climate warms, Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are on the march, moving into communities where dengue fever has not historically been a problem.\xa0\n“Slowly those Aedes aegypti are moving northwards and places like Vietnam, where traditionally Hanoi doesn\'t have many cases and Ho Chi Minh City does, slowly the mosquitoes are moving up the country as the climate changes,” Hibberd said.\n“What you need is Aedes aegypti occupying those cities and you’re ripe for dengue to turn up.”\nThere has been encouraging progress with scientific research on innovative new ways to tackle the disease.\nA recent large-scale trial in Yogyakarta in Indonesia saw mosquitoes carrying a naturally occurring bacterium called Wolbachia introduced into the environment, with the aim of boosting the immune systems of local mosquitoes and making them less prone to transmitting viruses.\nThe study resulted in a 77 per cent decrease in dengue, making it highly successful and building upon similar research done in Brazil, Colombia, Sri Lanka and Vietnam.\n\n\nElsewhere, Singapore\'s National Environment Agency has been conducting phased field studies to evaluate the use of male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes to suppress the urban Aedes aegypti mosquito – the primary vector of dengue, chikungunya and Zika viruses in the city-state.\nOverall, despite the positive outlook in 2021, the dengue story in this region remains a problematic one. Hibberd said\xa0that the “long-term trends are all up"",\xa0noting that therapies and vaccines are still a distant hope.\xa0\nThe WHO has implored countries\xa0to build up their capacity to handle the disease. The cyclical nature of dengue fever means a more serious outbreak is expected within the next two or three years.\n“Unfortunately, dengue continues to be neglected, with a lack of resources at the country level and declining operational funds in recent years in the region,” the spokesperson said.\n', 'related_topics': ['     climate change ', '     WHO ', '     Pandemic ', '     COVID-19 ', '     health ', '     science ']}"

      Study nixes life in clouds of Venus, but raises questions for Jupiter
  </h1>, 'text': 'CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida:\xa0A new study is throwing cold water on the possibility of life in the clouds of Venus.\nScientists from Europe and the US\xa0reported on Monday there isn’t nearly enough water vapour in the scorching planet’s clouds to support life as we know it.\nThe team looked into the matter following September’s surprise announcement by others that strange, tiny organisms could be lurking in the thick, sulphuric acid-filled clouds of Venus. Through spacecraft observations, the latest research group found the water level is more than 100 times too low to support Earth-like life.\n“It\'s almost at the bottom of the scale and an unbridgeable distance from what life requires to be active,” said the lead author, John Hallsworth, a microbiologist at Queen\'s University Belfast in Northern Ireland.\nHis team looked at the most dry-tolerant and also the most acid-tolerant microbes on Earth -\xa0and they “wouldn\'t stand a chance in Venus"".\nWhile the latest findings veto Venus at least for water-based organisms, they identify another planet -\xa0Jupiter -\xa0with enough water in the clouds and the right atmospheric temperatures to support life.\n“Now I\'m not suggesting there\'s life on Jupiter and I\'m not even suggesting life could be there because it would need the nutrients to be there and we can\'t be sure of that,” Hallsworth stressed to reporters. “But still it\'s a profound and exciting finding and totally unexpected.”\nFurther studies will be needed to ascertain whether microbial life might exist deep in the clouds of Jupiter, according to Hallsworth and NASA astrobiologist Chris McKay, a co-author on the research paper published Monday in the journal Nature Astronomy.\nAs for Venus, three new spacecraft will be headed there later this decade and early next -\xa0two by NASA and one by the European Space Agency. Hallsworth and and McKay don\'t expect their results to change regarding uninhabitable water activity at our solar system\'s hottest planet.\n“It’s unfortunate because I’m very interested in searching for life on other worlds and I would love to think that Venus is habitable,” McKay said.\nThe scientists behind the September study possibly hinting at life in the Vesuvian clouds based their findings on the presence of the toxic gas phosphine. On Earth, it\'s associated with life. The researchers argued that Venus\' phosphine levels are too high to be geologic in origin.\n“We are not trying to push Venus as a definitely habitable world.

      US duo win Nobel for work on temperature and touch
  </h1>, 'text': 'STOCKHOLM:\xa0US scientists David Julius and Ardem Patapoutian on Monday (Oct 4) won the Nobel Medicine Prize for discoveries on receptors for temperature and touch.\nThe duo\'s research, conducted independently of each other in the late 1990s and 2000s, is being used to develop treatments for a wide range of diseases and conditions, including chronic pain.\nJulius, who in 2019 won the US$3-million Breakthrough Prize in life sciences, said he was stunned to receive the call from the Nobel committee early on Monday.\n""One never really expects that to happen,"" he told Swedish Radio. ""I thought it was a prank.""\nOur ability to sense heat, cold and touch is essential for survival, the Nobel Committee said, and underpins our interaction with the world around us.\n""The groundbreaking discoveries ... by this year\'s Nobel Prize laureates have allowed us to understand how heat, cold and mechanical force can initiate the nerve impulses that allow us to perceive and adapt to the world,"" the Nobel jury said.\n""In our daily lives we take these sensations for granted, but how are nerve impulses initiated so that temperature and pressure can be perceived? This question has been solved by this year\'s Nobel Prize laureates.""\nJulius, 65, was recognised for his research using capsaicin - a compound from chilli peppers that induces a burning sensation - to identify which nerve sensors in the skin respond to heat.\nThe human body generates heat in response to inflammation, so we can protect the affected area and allow it to heal.\nJulius told Scientific American in 2019 that he got the idea to study chilli peppers after a visit to the grocery store.\n""I was looking at these shelves and shelves of basically chilli peppers and extracts (hot sauce) and thinking, \'This is such an important and such a fun problem to look at. I\'ve really got to get serious about this\',"" he said.\nPatapoutian\'s pioneering discovery was identifying the class of nerve sensors that respond to touch.\n""In science many times it\'s things we take for granted that are of high interest,"" Patapoutian told the Nobel Foundation website.\nTouch receptors were ""the big elephant in the room: we knew they existed, we knew they did something very different than how most other cells communicate with each other, which is through chemicals"".\nJulius, a professor at the University of California in San Francisco and the 12-year-younger Patapoutian, a professor at Scripps Research in California, will share the Nobel Prize cheque for 10 million Swedish kronor (US$1.1 million, €1 million).\nThe pair were not among the frontrunners mentioned in speculation ahead of the announcement.\nPioneers of messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which paved the way for mRNA Covid vaccines, and immune system researchers had been widely tipped as favourites.\nWhile the 2020 award was handed out during the pandemic, this is the first time the entire selection process has taken place under the shadow of COVID-19.\nLast year, the award went to three virologists for the discovery of the Hepatitis C virus.\nThe Nobel season continues on Tuesday with the award for physics and Wednesday with chemistry, followed by the much-anticipated gongs for literature on Thursday and peace on Friday before the economics prize winds things up on Monday, Oct 11.\nSpeculation on potential Peace Prize winners has ranged from the Belarusian opposition to climate campaigners such as Sweden\'s Greta Thunberg.\nLiterary circles have been buzzing with speculation that the Swedish academy could choose to rectify an imbalance with the literature prize that has seen Europe and North America dominate since 2012.\nIn total, those two regions account for 95 of 117 literature laureates.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Nobel prize ', '     medicine ', '     science ']}"

      Commentary: No, COVID-19 vaccines don’t stay in your body for years
  </h1>, 'text': 'MELBOURNE: As Australia strives to reach its national COVID-19 vaccination targets, there’s unprecedented focus on the biological effects of vaccines.\nWhile there’s an enormous amount of information available online, it’s increasingly difficult to discern truth from falsehood or even conspiracy.\nA common myth of vaccines that has appeared in recent months is the accusation they remain active in the body for extended periods of time – a claim which has increased vaccine hesitancy in some people.\nHowever, vaccines are cleared from your body in mere days or weeks. It’s the immune response against the SARS-CoV-2 virus that appears to last for a long time.\nThis isn’t due to the vaccines themselves remaining in the body. Instead, the vaccines stimulate our immune system and teach it how to respond if we’re ever exposed to the coronavirus.\nAll vaccines, no matter the technology, have the same fundamental goal – to introduce the immune system to an infectious agent, without the risk that comes from disease.\nThe vaccine needs to follow a similar pathway a virus would have taken to produce an adequate immune response. Viruses enter our cells and use them to replicate themselves. So, the vaccines also need to be delivered in cells where proteins are produced, which mimics a component of the virus itself.\nThe COVID-19 vaccines all do this by delivering information into our muscle cells, usually in our upper arm. They do this in different ways, such as using mRNA, like Pfizer-BioNTech\xa0and Moderna, or viral vectors, like AstraZeneca.\nRegardless of the technology, the effect is similar. Our cells use the genetic template in the vaccine to produce the coronavirus’ spike protein, which is a part of the virus that helps it enter our cells. The spike protein is transported to the surface of the cell where it’s detected by the immune cells nearby.\nThere are also other specialised immune cells nearby, which take up the spike proteins and use them to inform more immune cells – targeting them specifically against COVID-19.\nThese immune cells include B cells, which produce antibodies, and T cells, which kill virus-infected cells. They then become long-lasting memory cells, which wait and monitor for the next time it sees a spike protein.\nIf you’re exposed to the virus, these memory B and T cells allow a faster and larger immune response, destroying the virus before it can cause disease.\nOnce they’ve initiated the immune response, the vaccines themselves are rapidly broken down and cleared from the body.\nThe mRNA vaccines consist of a fatty shell, which encapsulates a group of mRNA particles – the genetic recipe for the spike protein. Once this enters a cell, the shell is degraded to harmless fats, and the mRNA is used by the cells to produce spike proteins.\nOnce the mRNA has been used to produce proteins, it’s broken down and cleared from the cell along with the rest of the mRNAs produced by the normal function of the cell.\nIn fact, mRNA is very fragile, with the most long lasting only able to survive for a few days. This is why the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines have to be so carefully preserved at ultra-low temperatures.\nThe vector vaccines (AstraZeneca and Johnson and Johnson) use an adenovirus, which is harmless in humans, as a vector to deliver a genetic template for the spike protein to the cells.\nThe vector virus has all of its infectious components removed, so it’s unable to multiply or cause disease. Then a genetic template for the spike protein is inserted into the vector.\nOnce the vaccine is injected, the vector virus binds to your cells and inserts its genetic components, before the shell breaks down and is removed.\nThe viral machinery gets the genetic template into the control room of the cell, the nucleus, where it takes advantage of our normal protein building activity. The vaccine doesn’t cause any alteration to our DNA.\nNormally, this would cause the cell to start producing more copies of the virus, but since this was all removed, all that’s produced is the spike protein.\nAgain, after making a large amount of the spike, the genetic templates are broken down in a matter of days or weeks.\nWhile the vaccines themselves are rapidly removed, what then happens to all the spike proteins that are produced as a result?\nThey’re identified as foreign by the immune system and destroyed – teaching the cells to recognise the coronavirus in the process.\nThe spike proteins are fully cleared from the body after a few weeks. In this time, they don’t appear to leave the vaccination site, most often your upper arm.\nBut antibodies specifically targeting the spike protein produced by your immune system remain in the body for many months after vaccination.\nThe vaccines also stimulate your immune system to produce memory immune cells. This means even once antibody levels diminish, your immune system is ready to produce more antibodies and other immune cells to tackle the virus if you’re ever exposed to it.\nVasso Apostolopoulos is Professor of Immunology and Associate Provost, Research Partnerships at Victoria University, Australia.

      US man recovering after 'breakthrough' pig heart transplant
  </h1>, 'text': 'CHICAGO: A United States\xa0man with terminal heart disease was implanted with a genetically modified pig heart in a first-of-its-kind surgery, and three days later, the patient is doing well, his doctors reported on Monday (Jan 10).\nThe surgery, performed by a team at the University of Maryland Medicine, is among the first to demonstrate the feasibility of a pig-to-human heart transplant, a field made possible by new gene editing tools.\nIf proven successful, scientists hope that pig organs could help alleviate shortages of donor organs.\n“This was a breakthrough surgery and brings us one step closer to solving the organ shortage crisis,”\xa0Dr\xa0Bartley Griffith, who surgically transplanted the pig heart into the patient, said in a statement.\n“There are simply not enough donor human hearts available to meet the long list of potential recipients.”\n“We are proceeding cautiously, but we are also optimistic that this first-in-the-world surgery will provide an important new option for patients in the future,” Griffith added.\nFor 57-year-old David Bennett of Maryland, the heart transplant was his last option.\n""It was either die or do this transplant. I want to live. I know it’s a shot in the dark, but it’s my last choice,” Bennett said a day before his surgery, according to a statement released by the university.\nTo move ahead with the experimental surgery, the university obtained an emergency authorisation from the US\xa0Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\xa0on New Year\'s Eve through its compassionate use program.\n""The FDA used our data and data on the experimental pig to authorise the transplant in an end-stage heart disease patient who had no other treatment options,” said Dr\xa0Muhammad Mohiuddin, who heads the University\'s program on xenotransplantation - transplanting animal organs into humans.\nAbout 110,000 Americans are currently waiting for an organ transplant, and more than 6,000 patients die each year before getting one, according to organdonor.gov.\nBennett\'s genetically modified pig heart was provided by Revivicor, a regenerative medicine company based in Blacksburg, Virginia.\nOn the morning of the surgery, the transplant team removed the pig\'s heart and placed it into a special device to preserve its function until the surgery.\nPigs have long been a tantalising source of potential transplants because their organs are so similar to human organs. A hog heart at the time of slaughter, for example, is about the size of an adult human heart.\nOther organs from pigs being researched for transplantation into humans include the kidneys, liver and lungs.\nPrior efforts at pig-to-human transplants have failed because of genetic differences that caused organ rejection or viruses that posed an infection risk.\nScientists have tackled that problem by editing away potentially harmful genes.\nIn the heart implanted in Bennett, three genes previously linked with organ rejection were ""knocked out"" of the donor pig, and six human genes linked with immune acceptance were inserted into the pig genome.\nResearchers also deleted a pig gene to prevent excessive growth of the pig heart tissue.\nThe work was funded in part with a US$15.7 million research grant to evaluate Revivicor\'s genetically modified pig hearts in baboon studies.\nIn addition to the genetic changes to the pig heart, Bennett received an experimental anti-rejection drug made by Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals based in Lexington, Massachusetts.\n', 'related_topics': ['     United States ', '     health ', '     science ']}"

      Medical face masks make men look more attractive, UK study finds

The least attractive faces were completely uncovered.\nThis was true whether the men were considered\xa0attractive or unattractive before the coverings were introduced, according to the study published in the journal\xa0Cognitive Research: Principles and Implications on Monday (Jan 10).\nThe\xa0results ran counter to\xa0findings of similar research conducted before the COVID-19 pandemic, said the authors of the study.\nA 2016 study in Japan found a ""sanitary-mask effect"" showing that people associated medical masks with disease, perceiving masked faces as less healthy and hence less attractive.\n""While medical masks might prime disease, they can also be seen as a sign of being responsible and caring citizens, which may positively impact perceived attractiveness,"" said the Cardiff University researchers.\nThis was in line with other research conducted during the pandemic that ""shows faces wearing medical masks are considered more likely to be ill, but also more socially desirable and trustworthy"".\nResearchers at Cardiff University conducted their experiment\xa0in February 2021, about seven months after face masks were made compulsory in places like supermarkets and public transport\xa0in the UK.\n""Research carried out before the pandemic found medical face masks reduce attractiveness,"" said Dr Michael B Lewis, one of the study\'s authors, in an article on Cardiff University\'s website.\n""We wanted to test whether this had changed since face coverings became ubiquitous and understand whether the type of mask had any effect.""\nForty-three female psychology undergraduates were asked to rate 160 male faces for attractiveness on a scale of 1 to 7.\nThese 160 stimuli consisted of 40 male faces in four\xa0variations: Full uncovered face, covered by a notebook, covered by a cloth mask and covered by a medical mask.\nThe women were also asked whether they agreed that ""face masks have become part of everyday life in the past year"" and ""the use of face masks is effective in preventing the spread of COVID-19"". They showed high levels of agreement with the statements.\nResults showed that faces covered by medical masks were ""significantly more attractive"" than cloth masks. Faces covered in cloth masks were in turn ""significantly more attractive"" than uncovered faces.\nThe advantage for\xa0covered faces was consistent with general findings that covering facial features increases attractiveness, regardless of which features are covered and the ""base attractiveness"" of the face, said the study\'s authors.\nBut ""there appears to be an advantage to medical masks beyond this"", they added.\n""The advantage for a cloth mask can be attributed to the effect of occlusion, but the effect of the medical mask goes beyond just hiding undesirable features,"" the authors said.\n""It is possible that the additional advantage for medical masks comes from their associations with medical professionals.""\nThey added that this effect ""may only be present during the COVID-19 pandemic"".\nDr Lewis said the research shows that the pandemic has ""changed our psychology"" in how mask-wearers are perceived.\n""When we see someone wearing a mask we no longer think, \'That person has a disease, I need to stay away,\'"" he said.\n""This relates to evolutionary psychology and why we select the partners we do.
