      New ‘Overexposure Law’ creates stir in Korea
  </h1>, 'text': 'SEOUL: A new law aimed at curbing public nudity and indecent exposure, which went into effect on Friday, has been creating a lot of buzz in Korea recently, drawing comments from celebrities and citizens alike, reported Korean media.The law states that anyone deemed to be ""overexposed"" in public will slapped with a 50,000 won (S$56) fine.What the term ""overexposed"" actually means is not clearly defined, leading Koreans to start questioning whether it is a de facto ban on short shorts and miniskirts, and how it will affect the Korean entertainment industry, where sexy, revealing costumes are de rigueur for female stars.Some celebrities have also commented on the ban.""Overexposure will get you fined, is this real? Then I\'m dead,"" tweeted Korean singer Lee Hyori, who is known for her sexy image, earlier this month.However, Korean authorities have since stressed that the new law is not an attempt to control what Koreans wear, and have stated that they will strive to educate the public on the actual purpose of the new law. \n', 'related_topics': ['     Korea ', '     law ', '     Entertainment ', '     K-pop ']}"

      Youth have to help in the 'fight back' against radicalisation: Shanmugam
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: As individuals in Singapore become radicalised at a faster pace\xa0and more people are\xa0arrested, young people have a part to play in the\xa0""fight back"" against extremism, Minister for Home Affairs and Law K\xa0Shanmugam said on Saturday (Aug 11).\nSpeaking at ITE College Central to a youth forum\xa0of about 300 students, Mr\xa0Shanmugam said that people can become radicalised more quickly,\xa0calling this a ""worrying"" development.\n""The other thing that is worrying is, in the past, it took about two years\xa0for people to get radicalised,"" he said. ""But now, sometimes it is two\xa0months, three months.""\n""Sometimes, internationally, it has even been three to four days,"" said Mr\xa0Shanmugam. ""That becomes very difficult for the security forces.""\nIn addition, the number of arrests being made in Singapore has been\xa0increasing, said the minister.\n""If you take 2007 to 2014, that is eight years, we had 11 Singaporeans that\xa0we dealt with,"" he said. ""But if you look at 2015 to the present, three-and-a-half years, we have arrested or dealt with 20 in just three-and-a-half years.""\nOf these 20 people, 18 were radicalised online, said the minister, adding\xa0that this showed ""how important it is to make sure your online space is\xa0okay"".\nThe minister also warned against complacency in the fight against extremism.\n""We have the situation relatively under control, but neither you nor I can\xa0say we have won,"" he said. ""We have to be on guard and we have to fight\xa0back.""\nTo this end, defending against extremism does not just fall to the\xa0Government, but youth have a part to play too, said Mr Shanmugam.\n""Fighting back does not just mean the Government,"" he said. ""Fighting back\xa0essentially has to be you. You have to help in the fight back.""\nFirstly, young people should go to established sources to learn about\xa0religion, said Mr Shanmugam.\nIn addition, they can also ""help in the fight by going online positively""\xa0with positive messages.\nSaid the minister: ""You have to help, you have to teach your friends, you\xa0have to put out the positive messages of peace, universal brotherhood and\xa0sisterhood, friendship, living together and working together in a common\xa0space.

""If we do not mix with each other, that identity is gone.""\n""MORE WORRIED"" ABOUT AL-QAEDA, JI\nTouching on extremism around the world, Mr Shanmugam said that while attention has been focused on Islamic State, he was actually ""more worried"" about groups such as Al-Qaeda and Jemaah Islamiyah (JI).\nAl-Qaeda has been active around the world, including Southeast Asia, Indonesia and Malaysia, while JI is ""particularly active"" in Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines and Singapore, said the minister.\n""While the attention has been focused on (Islamic State), Al-Qaeda and JI have been quietly gathering strength, regrouping, putting out their material, gathering recruits, gathering money for major attacks in due course,"" he said.\n""Al-Qaeda today is said to be bigger, more people, more countries, than they ever were.

      Singapore Bar exams to be more stringent, practice training period extended to a year
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: From 2023, law graduates who want to be practising lawyers will have to complete one year of practice training with a firm instead of the current six months, after passing the Singapore Bar examinations.\nIn addition, Part B of the exam will be more stringent, announced Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon in a speech\xa0on Thursday (Aug 30). Part B is taken by graduates from both local and overseas universities, while Part A is a requirement only for those from overseas universities.\nFor law graduates who decide not to become practising lawyers, they can still be called to the Bar after passing the exams – without having to complete the practice training period.\nThis means a practice training contract will no longer be a pre-condition for admission to the Bar. For these students, they can pursue alternative careers such as becoming an in-house counsel, practice support lawyers, law academics and legal technologists.\n“The completion of a practice training contract will only be a pre-requisite for those who intend to practice law,” said Chief Justice Menon.\n“This proposal recognises that a person who has studied law can contribute to society without becoming a practising lawyer, and that it is not necessary for those who choose to pursue different pathways to first complete a period of practical training before starting work.”\nThe changes, which the Chief Justice described as a “significant restructuring” of the professional training regime, were among the recommendations made by the Committee for the Professional Training of Lawyers.\nFormed in August 2016, the committee chaired by Justice Quentin Loh included judges and law practitioners.\nThe committee\'s report, which was published on the Supreme Court\'s website on Thursday afternoon, detailed challenges to the existing training regime of lawyers in Singapore.\nAmong the findings were: A lack of training information, intense competition for practice training contracts and a lack of consistency in training standards across firms.\nAdditionally, even after law graduates completed their practice training, there was a perceived ""lack of transparency in the decision-making process"" on whether or not they were retained in the law firms.\nJustice Loh said the committee believes that its recommendations ""will raise the quality and consistency of training standards across law firms and provide different pathways and opportunities for the legal profession"".\nCHANGES WILL GIVE LAW GRADS \'GREATER FLEXIBILITY AND CHOICE\'\nThe Ministry of Law said in a statement that it has accepted in principle the proposals, along with 17 other recommendations on the training of lawyers.\n""The proposed change recognises that a legal education can lead to different career pathways, and allows law graduates greater flexibility and choice,"" said the ministry.\nIt also pointed out that the practice training period for solicitors in the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Hong Kong is two years.\nImplementing the recommendations in 2023 will give the industry ""time to adjust"", the ministry added, and the majority of students who are currently in law school will not be affected.\nSpeaking at the first session of this year\'s mass call, where more than 450 newly appointed law advocates and solicitors will be called to the Bar, Chief Justice Menon touched on the qualities that a lawyer should have, including passionate curiosity and finding solutions with technology.\nHe also reminded them of former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew\'s definition of the role of a lawyer as a ""legal architect"" in the nation-building project.\n', 'related_topics': ['     law ']}"

      'They are literally raising the bar': Changes to Singapore Bar exams draw mixed feelings
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Proposals that will change how law graduates qualify to become practising lawyers from 2023 drew mixed reactions from law students and associates, with some welcoming them while others felt that the changes may deter some students.\nChief Justice Sundaresh Menon announced on Thursday (Aug 30) that law graduates will have to complete a year of practice training with a firm, double the current six months, after passing the Singapore Bar examinations from 2023.\nAnother significant change will be the raising of the standard of Part B of the exams. Part B is taken by graduates from local and overseas universities, while Part A is a requirement only for overseas graduates.\nThese changes are the first significant ones to the professional training regime for lawyers\xa0since 2010, when the Practical Law Course was revamped into Part B of the exams, according to the Ministry of Law.\nSome have welcomed the recommendations. Professor Simon Chesterman, dean of the National University of Singapore\'s Faculty of Law, said that the more stringent requirements should ensure that the students who wish to enter practice are prepared for the challenges and opportunities that await them.\n""At the same time, law firms should use the longer training period to offer a solid grounding for the next generation of lawyers, with diverse experiences and supportive mentorship,"" he said.\nMr Shashi Nathan, the regional head of dispute resolution and partner at law firm Withers KhattarWong, said that the changes are ""very welcome"" for both law firms and young lawyers.\n""It helps law firms because we now know that with the enhanced exams and the one-year training, you\'re going to get higher-quality young lawyers come into practice,"" said the 51-year-old, who has been practising law for 25 years. ""Now, we find that young lawyers, after six months, they are still finding their feet. But a year of training, exposure and mentoring certainly give\xa0you the equipment and the arms to go to war.""\nAs for the more difficult exams, Mr Nathan said he did not think there was anything wrong to expect the highest quality for lawyers in Singapore, as practice itself ""is becoming more difficult"".\nHe said he felt there still is a glut of lawyers, and ""I think part of the recommendations may have come from (that)"".\nARE STRICTER EXAMS A WAY TO LIMIT NUMBER OF LAWYERS?\xa0\nLaw students that Channel NewsAsia spoke to referred to the 2014 glut of lawyers experienced in Singapore, and hinted that the new moves could be to\xa0avoid this.\nIn response to media queries, the Ministry of Law said that the number of overseas law graduates returning to Singapore peaked in 2014, at about 350.\n""The number has since fallen by about 25 per cent to about 260,"" said the ministry spokesman. ""About 690 law graduates, both overseas and local, enter the job market each year.""\nLast year, more than 90 per cent secured training contracts, which is currently required for them to be called to the Bar.\nWhen asked if the new changes are in response to the 2014 oversupply of lawyers, the Committee that recommended the changes told Channel NewsAsia: ""The Committee was established to undertake a holistic review of the professional training regime for trainee lawyers in Singapore. The central theme of the Committee\'s recommendations is training to ensure that the needs of the public are well served and lawyers are equipped to face future challenges, regardless of economic conditions.""\nWhether or not the moves are calculated to limit the number of practising lawyers, some law students feel they may deter some from becoming lawyers.\nThe changes will not affect Mr Daryl Yang, 25, a current Yale-NUS student who will likely be called to the bar in 2020, but he said the longer training period may deter those who ""are not entirely sure that they want to practise law from trying in the first place"".\nHe added that one year might be too long, saying that trainees are paid significantly less than associates.\nWhile Mr Yang found it encouraging that the legal fraternity was ""recognising the diversity of the role of legally trained people beyond practising lawyers"", he said: ""I\'m not sure if the standard of the Part B examinations directly translates into the abilities of a practising lawyer, so I\'m not sure if it necessarily raises the standard.""\nHOW POPULAR ARE ALTERNATIVE LAW CAREERS?\nIn response to queries from the media, the Ministry of Law said that one in five law graduates who were called to the Bar in 2017 did not go on to practise law.\nProfessor Chesterman said that ""the reality is that not every law student wants to practise"".\n""The new regime will enable such students to complete their legal training, get called to the Bar, and then choose the path that suits them. They can then use their legal training in other sectors of the economy,"" he said.\nLawyer hopeful Jason Hong, 25, who graduated last year from Durham University, said that among his friends, those who do not want to become practising lawyers are a minority.\nMr Hong, who failed his Part A exam recently and hopes to pass it later this year, welcomed the extended practice training.\nAs an overseas law graduate, he had to undergo relevant legal training, which is similar to practice training.\nHe found this useful, as he ""learnt a lot more than I would in law school because so many things are different in practice"".\n""I think the extra time, while it may be daunting to some, is a really good learning experience,"" he said.\nAsked about the more stringent Part B exams, Mr Hong laughed and said: ""For me, it\'s already very hard to pass Part A.""\nHowever, he added: ""You have to give and take when it comes to things like this ... they are literally raising the bar. So they want to get the best.""\n', 'related_topics': ['     law ']}"

      How did conservative India come to repeal S377’s ban on consensual gay sex?
  </h1>, 'text': 'INDIA: Some have hailed it as a step towards freedom from discrimination, humiliation and oppression.\nCertainly, India’s Supreme Court ruling on Section 377 (S377) of the Penal Code has given a new lease of life to millions who had been living under the weight of criminality and in the shadow of fear.\nNot only was there an overwhelming response from gay rights activists and the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community, there was also support from the main political parties, like the opposition Congress party.\nThe ruling Bharatiya Janata Party did not oppose the judgment, while the Hindu group Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) even supported the ruling, saying that gay sex was not a crime but a moral issue.\nWhile S377, which criminalises\xa0sexual activities ""against the order of nature"", remains in force in relation to sex with minors and bestiality, the court ruled last\xa0month that its application to\xa0consensual homosexual sex between adults was\xa0unconstitutional.\nSo how did its decision find resonance in a diverse but largely conservative society like India, with its mix of religions and cultures?\nOne factor is the country’s record on gay issues, in which centuries of tolerance before its British colonial rulers introduced S377 in the 19th century were followed by decades of bullying.\nBut\xa0that complicated past raises another question: Will the ruling really change social attitudes, remove stigma and grant LGBT Indians greater protection?\nAs experts and activists tell the programme Insight, it may take a long time for the community to be accepted as equal members of the world’s largest democracy. (Watch the full episode here.)\nWATCH: What a rape survivor, lawyers and activist say (8:29)\nEVOLVING SOCIETY\nA chapter in Indian history may have been closed, but conservative figures and hard-line groups have vowed to fight a ruling they see as shameful.\n“You can’t change the mindset of the society by using the hammer of law. This is against the … religious values of this country,” said Mr Ajay Gautam, the chief of the right-wing Hum Hindu group.\nAnd yet Hinduism has been permissive towards same-sex love, with old temples such as those in the Khajuraho world heritage site depicting erotic encounters on their walls, pointed out Institute of South Asian Studies visiting senior research fellow Ronojoy Sen.\n“Hindu society, both in ancient and medieval India, was much freer and more open,” said Dr Sen, who also cited characters who defy gender boundaries in the Mahabharata, the Hindu epic.\n“With the coming of the British as well as reform movements of the 19th century within Hinduism, there was a certain closing of the doors and the minds, a certain sense of Victorian morality that came to the foreground … The more flexible aspects of Hinduism often fell by the wayside.”\nIn recent years, however, Indian society has been evolving. Data from 2006 showed that 64 per cent of Indians believed that homosexuality is never justified, and 41 per cent would not want a homosexual neighbour.\nBut a World Bank report in 2014 found that “negative attitudes have diminished over time”. In 2011, for example, a “third gender” category was added to the male and female options on India’s census forms for the first time.\nOver 490,000 transgender individuals of all ages chose that option, although many observers believe that the figure is an underestimation, given the stigma attached.\nAnd in 2014, the Supreme Court recognised transgenders as equal citizens under this rubric of the third gender.\nA year earlier, the same apex court had ruled that S377 did not suffer from the “vice of unconstitutionality”, only to reverse its stand within five years following another petition.\nA MATTER OF RIGHTS, NOT MAJORITARIANISM\nIn delivering the unanimous verdict on Sept 6, Chief Justice Dipak Misra said: “Criminalising carnal intercourse under Section 377 (of the) Indian Penal Code is irrational, indefensible and manifestly arbitrary.”\nJustice R F Nariman, another of the five Supreme Court judges on the bench, added: “Homosexuals have a right to live with dignity. They must be able to live without stigma.”\nIt was a “beautiful judgment”, said Ms Menaka Guruswamy, one of the petitioners’ lawyers. “(The justices) are saying that India … must be governed by constitutional morality, not majoritarianism, not popular morality, not social morality, but the Constitution\'s morality,” she said.\n“That’s really heartening because, here, the Supreme Court is connecting it to larger issues of democracy … and just so much more than a simple reading of consensual sexual acts.”\nMs Katju agreed that the judgment will have a “far-reaching impact” because it “stresses the role of the court as a counter-majoritarian institution … to protect minorities against the will of majorities”.\nTo the lead lawyer in the case, Mr Anand Grover, the judgment affirmed India’s constitutional values – “that we need an inclusive society (where) each individual has … justice, social, economic and political (rights), liberty, equality (and) fraternity”.\n“The majority can’t dictate to the minority. Even if that person is one individual, that individual’s rights would be upheld,” he said.\nThe court also acknowledged the 17-year legal battle the activists fought, which began in 2001 when the LGBT rights group Naz Foundation filed a public interest litigation in the Delhi High Court to challenge the constitutionality of S377.\nJustice Indu Malhotra said: “History owes an apology to members of the community for the delay in ensuring their rights.”\nThat acknowledgement was what struck the group’s founder Anjali Gopalan because it was “unheard of in our system”.\nWhile she found the political response to be muted in contrast to what the court said, the lawyer Ms Katju thinks political parties are “very clear” about where India is going, with half its population under the age of 25.\n“The Indian voter is now, by and large, a young voter. And Indian voters are looking for India to play a role on the global stage. That includes taking a leadership position when it comes to rights,” she said.\nS377’S OPPRESSION\nFor the LGBT community, however, S377 was not only a denial of rights, but also a veil of darkness that had enveloped their lives.\nOne such person who had to bear his pain in silence is Mr Manoj. Barely out of his teens, he was gang-raped multiple times but was afraid to report the matter for fear of being charged.\nHe was not the only one. According to Mr Grover, many gay men were victims of blackmail, violent assaults and rape by dating partners, the police and “even family members who wanted to convert gay men into straight men”.\nThe reason nobody could go (to a police station) was if they went there, they’d be identified as gay … So 377 allowed the violence to go on, and no remedies were available.\n“Consent was immaterial, so a victim could be said to be also part of the sexual offence under 377,"" he added. ""You’d have had to prove (non-consent).”\nIn Mr Manoj’s case, his assailants were three Delhi policemen. And they kept calling his number, telling him to meet them at lonely spots and threatening to book him under S377 if he refused. He attempted suicide three times.\nThe gang rape, blackmail and torture went on for one and a half years, until he managed to get their home numbers and threatened to call their wives and parents.\nAnother gay victim who was tortured was Mr Arif Jafar, when he was arrested in 2001 under S377 and thrown in jail for 47 days. He was not even given water and was forced to survive on sewage water.\nThe LGBT rights activist – who set up India’s first gay group, in Lucknow city, when he was 19 – had launched a programme to help HIV patients living in slums when the harassment and threats began.\nBut he never anticipated the nightmare that was to come in prison, where he was beaten and lost most of his teeth because of the unhygienic conditions.\nAfter he was released on bail, he spent months in hospital fighting for his life. And even now, the police have not produced any evidence against the 48-year-old, who was one of the S377 petitioners.\nHe was held illegally in prison, noted Mr Danish Sheikh, an assistant professor and associate director of the Centre for Health, Law Ethics and Technology at the Jindal Global Law School.\nSo one of the things Mr Sheikh hopes can now change is that the law will no longer be misused as an “indirect way to persecute individuals”, and that male or transgender survivors of sexual assault can have judicial remedy.\nLONG ROAD AHEAD\nThough that part of the Penal Code has now been declared illegal, there is still a question mark over whether the LGBT community can find its place in India.\nGay rights activist and Hindustan Times writer Dhrubo Jyoti believes it is time to ensure and affirm non-discrimination in matters such as jobs, education and health care, which “the rest of the population can take for granted”.\nThese are “far more important”, he said, than what has happened in the West, where marriage, adoption and inheritance “became the next big focal points” after decriminalisation while everyday rights “remained on the back burner.”\nNonetheless, the issue of marriage will come up “soon”, predicted Mr Grover. “If an Indian citizen is married to (another) Indian citizen abroad, where the marriage is legal, and they come here … can (they) assert that the marriage is legal?”\nIn his view, it would be difficult for the courts to not recognise the marriage. “There are lots of issues that would open up now … like (intersex) athletes,” he added.\n“Those people will now be coming into the fold of public life, where they’ll be demanding their place in the sun, as it were. And we’ll have to get used to it, in schools … institutions (and the) judiciary.”\nOne thing multimillionaire hotelier Keshav Suri hopes for is that LGBT couples will not have to “live in that fear that if one of us falls sick in India, the other one won’t be allowed to see (his or her partner)”.\nMr Suri, who got married in Paris, acknowledged that he could go to a private hospital where his husband could visit him, but that most Indians were not in that “privileged position”.\n“How do you explain to a doctor that the family has disowned this person and (you’re) the only person there?” he asked.\nThe only way to advance LGBT rights, Dr Sen\xa0added, would be to go before the court again. “And even the courts might be reluctant to push it any further in the absence of a political will.”\nWherever the LGBT movement goes from here, people like Mr Manoj hope that they can be seen as ordinary members of society and that homosexuality is recognised as a variant of sexuality rather than a mental illness as some believe.\n“We live in society, we’re from the society. We need acceptance from society as well. So we need to work on it,” he said. “It won’t be a one-day journey.”\nWatch the episode here.

      Simplifying the language of Singapore laws on track, as more people visit law website
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The ongoing simplification of the language of Singapore\'s laws is on track, with the next target within three years, even as the number of visitors to the Singapore Statutes Online website increased in the past three years.\nThe Attorney-General\'s Chambers (AGC) began its work to simplify existing laws in 2014, in response to the Plain Laws Understandable By Singaporeans (PLUS) survey of about 1,000 people by its Legislation Division.\nThe division, Singapore\'s central law drafting office, has been implementing the changes progressively with an aim to make the country\'s legislation more readable, the AGC told Channel NewsAsia.\nIn particular, attention is paid to the local use of English and the trend ""that average Singaporeans get information through digital platforms more than print"".\nAccording to the AGC, there were 1.73 million unique visitors in 2015 to\xa0its Singapore Statutes Online website, which lays out the country\'s laws in detail.\nThis increased to 1.87 million in 2016 and 2 million in 2017. On average, about a fifth of these users\xa0are from outside Singapore.\nThe number of visits is even higher - growing from 4.3 million in 2015 to 4.8 million in 2016 and 5.1 million last year.\nSome of the ways new laws are drafted take into consideration this digital audience. For example, legislative sentences in new Acts or subsidiary legislation are shorter than before.\nSpecifically, internal guidelines recommend that each sentence be kept within 45 words, which would fit on the screen of most mobile devices.\nSHORTER SENTENCES, ARCHAIC WORDS DISCONTINUED\nLong provisions and complex concepts are broken down into separate paragraphs, while simpler text is adopted in new laws where possible.\nFor example, archaic words like ""hereby"" and ""heretobefore"" have been discontinued from use, and the phrase ""for the avoidance of doubt"" has been replaced with ""to avoid doubt"". Roman numerals have also been replaced with Arabic numerals.\nThe lengthy section of the 1958 Public Order (Preservation) Act on carrying offensive weapons states: ""Any person who in any public place in any proclaimed area carries or has in his possession or under his control any offensive weapon or any explosive, corrosive or inflammable substance shall, unless that person proves that he carried the weapon, article or substance or had it in his possession or under his control solely for some lawful purpose, be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years and shall be liable to caning.""\nThe simplified revision of this section, under the 2018 Public Order and Safety (Special Powers) Act, reads: ""41 (1) A person commits an offence if the person -\na. is carrying or has in the person’s possession or under the person’s control any offensive weapon, other than for a lawful purpose; and\nb. is within the target area of a special authorisation.\n(2) A person who is guilty of an offence under subsection (1) shall be liable on conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years and shall also be liable to caning.""\nLaw drafters are encouraged to use online readability tests such as the Flesch Reading Ease Test (FRET) to determine how readable new laws are compared with older versions.\nThe AGC used FRET to compare the readability of the recent Public Order and Safety (Special Powers) Act 2018 against its predecessor, the Public Order (Preservation) Act, and found that the new act scored six times more on readability.\nAll Bills tabled in Parliament since 2015 have been accompanied by a more detailed Explanatory Statement, with illustrations or descriptions provided where appropriate on how the Bill\'s contents would affect existing law.\nThe Legislation Division has also produced a guide of about 600 pages to help law drafters find suitable words or phrases in plain English, in Singapore\'s context, to replace legalese, commercialese and complex phrases used in older laws.\nTo keep law drafters and editors abreast of the developments, drafting directives are regularly issued on the changes being implemented under the PLUS project.\nThe AGC is currently working on revising the current Acts of Parliament, more than 500 of them, and aims to complete this within the next three years.\n""This timeline is, however, subject to the demands on law drafting services for Government’s legislative programmes or proposals during this period,"" said the AGC spokesman.\nAfter this is completed, it will tackle the revision of more than 6,000 pieces of subsidiary legislation.\nREACTION TO THE SIMPLIFICATION PROCESS\nIn general, the public ""accepts that improving the readability of Singapore\'s written laws is an ongoing process"", the AGC said. It has not received any negative feedback on the new laws drafted since embarking on the simplification endeavour.\nNational University of Singapore (NUS) law professor David Tan said the AGC ""is doing a good job in the use of plain English when drafting some recent legislation"", such as the Protection from Harassment Act 2015.\n""In particular, the use of illustrative examples within the legislation is a helpful guide for both the public and the courts in the interpretation of certain sections,"" said Prof Tan.\nNUS law faculty dean Simon Chesterman said Singapore\'s laws are, ""for the most part, well-drafted and clear - though in some cases that clarity is most evident to lawyers and academics with legal training"".\n""Since laws are generally intended to promote order and stability, it is helpful if most people can read them without professional assistance,"" he said. ""As an American judge once observed, the language of the law should not be foreign to the ears of those expected to obey it.""\nHe pointed out that the wider move to plain English dates back to the 1970s, and has gained traction in many common law jurisdictions including the United States and Australia.\nIn the United Kingdom, an effort to rewrite the tax code in plain English began in 1996, and a progress report in 2009 estimated that it was saving around £70 million (S$126 million) annually in administrative costs, said Prof Chesterman.\nSingapore Management University (SMU) law don Eugene Tan echoed his counterparts\' views that Singapore\'s laws are ""generally drafted well - clear, concise and easy to understand"".\nHowever, there is still room to improve, he said.\xa0\n""The audience is not so much the lawyer but the average person who needs to know the law including the authorities that have to enforce the law, the ordinary citizens whose rights and responsibilities are affected by the law,"" said Associate Professor Tan.\n""Poorly drafted or hard to understand laws create uncertainty, confusion, misunderstanding - in sum, generating inefficiencies through increasing transaction costs of doing business,"" he said.\nEven so, Assoc Prof Tan pointed out that there ""are limits to the plain language drafting of legislation in practice"".\xa0\n""Overall, the plain language method of drafting is to be welcomed even as we keep in mind that it is not sufficient to remove every doubt as to legislative meaning of a particular law,"" he said.\nLaws are not good if people find it hard to understand them, Assoc Prof Tan said.\xa0\n""The law must work for the people, not people work for the law,"" he added.\xa0""Laws which are clear also help to reduce the need for litigation to resolve what is the meaning of a term, a clause, a provision in any piece of legislation.""\n', 'related_topics': ['     law ', '     AGC ']}"

      Commentary: What next in Singapore’s bid to protect against falsehoods and manipulation?
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: The Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Bill will eventually become law.\xa0\nWith the Bill already tabled in Parliament for its first reading on Apr 1, it will get a second reading at the next sitting of Parliament, and thereafter, be passed into law.\nIt is therefore important that eyes be already set on the future, on how the Government will eventually implement and enforce the new laws in the first weeks and months after it comes into force.\nWith the expectedly deep political undertones in early criticisms and international scrutiny, each step that the Government takes will have fundamental impacts on its credibility – both domestically and internationally. At its core, shaping and assessing truths is about trust, and the Government will do well to be mindful that with its next steps, it could either gain or lose that currency.\nThe coming weeks and the next time Parliament considers the Bill should also not be seen as a foregone conclusion either. The Bill will be read a second and third time, and for such groundbreaking legislation, there is still much for legislators to do.\nWILL GOVERNMENT OVER-REACH?\nIn its press release on the Bill, the Ministry of Law stated that “corrections will be the primary (emphasis added) response to a harmful online falsehood that is actively spreading”.\nIn a toolbox that includes various other tools from take-downs to disabling of inauthentic accounts and criminal sanctions, corrections – which are not criminal sanctions – are an admittedly calibrated option.\nQuestions, however, remain on the thresholds that the Government will have in moving from the “primary” action of corrections towards other tools in its toolbox.\nIn its sections dealing with the so-called “Correction Direction” and “Stop Communication Direction” mechanisms, the legislation does not currently provide any guiding criteria to dictate how decisions should be made on either route to take.\nAbsent such crucial information, the proof will only be in its implementation through policy and subsequent reviews.\nIn the meantime, while the Government has already taken pains to differentiate between falsehoods and opinion in outlining what would not fall under the ambit of the new law, more can be done to also clarify defining lines that may exist between falsehoods that will need correction versus those that will need to be taken down.\nWILL THE GOVERNMENT UNDER-REACH?\nOn the flip side, eyes will also be on whether and how the Government deals with the daily drip-feed of inconsequential lies and misrepresentations that have come to define social media.\nWill the Government intervene on a cleverly taken photograph that claims a block of public housing apartments has collapsed? Or will it intervene on another photo that shows a packet of non-halal meat residing in the halal shelves of a local supermarket?\nThe bar must be set high on what deserves Government attention, precisely to retain the requisite seriousness of the real issues that the legislation aims to address. As it stands, most casual lies and misrepresentations are often self-corrected by others on social media.\nTHE SHAPE OF GOVERNMENT ACTIONS\nThe language defining “public interest” as a threshold for governmental action involves the following:\nThe scope is large, but by dint of its early actions, the Government will eventually reveal which of the above will be key priorities in tackling falsehoods.\nIt will do well not to be seen to overly lean on any one particular area of concern.\nIn particular, how the Government interprets the scope for its action in the last category will be carefully watched, with each step potentially politically charged.\nAs it seeks to address falsehoods via corrections, the new law also offers a unique opportunity for the Government to take a significant step forward in terms of transparency and openness.\nFor example, if a false statement is made in the form of an allegation, how far and how quickly will the Government move in providing information to the public to prove the contrary? To maintain trust in the process, the imperative must necessarily lie in erring on the side of providing more, rather than less information.\n\xa0WILL THE GOVERNMENT MAKE MISTAKES?\nAs the Government seeks to correct and counteract falsehoods, the point has been reiterated that final decisions – where necessary – will be left to the courts.\nIn the draft legislation, the High Court will be able to set aside a Direction from the Government if: (i) the person concerned did not communicate in Singapore the issue concerned, (ii) it is not technically possible to comply, or (iii) the statement is not a statement of fact, or if it is a true statement of fact.\nFor the latter condition, there are therefore two grounds for the High Court to act: firstly, on interpretation, e.g. that the statement was found to be an opinion or satire; or secondly that upon further examination, the alleged falsehood was found to be true.\nThe possibility for decisions against the Government therefore exist, and where these do occur, will be of significant political signature.\nIn short, one court decision against a Government direction may be sufficient to cast doubt, and undermine trust in the enforcement of the new law.\nThe challenges for the Government are stark. As it ramps up its own internal processes and ability to detect and appropriately address fast-moving viral statements, it would do well to calibrate its reactions based on the range of considerations outlined above, and bear in mind the consequences of mis-steps and error.\nEven as the Government has its work cut out after the Bill’s passage, much work can still be done now, by legislators, before and during its second reading in Parliament.\xa0\nFor example, in lieu of another Select Committee which could now examine the legislative text, will legislators engage deeply on the specifics of the draft legislation, and provide not just deep arguments of principle based on the text, but delve into language and argue amendments when the Bill is committed to a Committee of the whole Parliament and read a third time?\nThere is no doubt clarifications can be made, and alternatives may arise.\nA case in point is in the “General Interpretations” of the Bill, where:\nAs it stands, a statement will be false if it is false (a tautology) or misleading (potentially vague).\nBesides dealing with the tautology, can more be done to provide clarity on what a “misleading” statement can be? For example, to address the range of benign or malign intents behind an intentionally deceptive statement versus one that might simply provide for differing interpretations.\nThere are other areas where clarifications might potentially be useful.\nThe Bill currently provides for a Minister to appoint an “alternate authority” – a public officer – to act on his behalf in exercising the powers provided under the Bill, during election periods, as well as at other times.\nCan more be done to refine the language in this section to deal with potential conflicts of interest, e.g. if potential falsehoods involve a specific Minister, or are in fact published by any Minister?\nLOOKING TO THE LONG TERM\nGiven its fundamental importance, the Bill is one that Parliament must not only examine carefully, but equally importantly, be seen to examine it with due care.\nGovernments change, but the laws of the land are meant to endure, to be interpreted, implemented and enforced by different governments with different philosophies.\nFor example, while the Ministry of Law may, as a matter of policy, now aim to use corrections as its main course of action, how can the law protect against misuse by a different government in the future, formed by an altogether different party or type of party?\nThe Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Bill will also not only provide for the immediate purposes of dealing with false statements of fact, but will form an indelible part of Singapore's legal system, and become the basis for future laws.\nAny government and Parliament must necessarily have this long-term perspective in mind, as it deals with the current threat of online falsehoods.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     law ']}"

      Law Society issues call for caution after 'alarming' scams targeting law firm clients
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The Law Society of Singapore (LawSoc) held an unprecedented\xa0press conference on Friday (May 24) urging the public to be cautious\xa0following an ""alarming"" series of scams in\xa0April, with one victim cheated out of a ""significant"" amount of money.\xa0\nThe scammers\xa0targeted clients of law firms. They would email the clients who were buyers in property transactions and, posing as their solicitor, request fund transfers.\xa0\nIt is not known if the two cases were linked and whether they were ""local fraudsters"" or based overseas, LawSoc president Gregory Vijayendran told reporters on Friday.\xa0\nIn the first case, the solicitor managed to stop the scam before\xa0the funds were transferred. The amount in the second case was ""significant"", but was not revealed due to issues of liability and confidentiality.\xa0\nBoth cases involved transactions for conveyancing, which refers to the transferring of a legal title in a property from one person to another.\xa0\nThe scammers targeted such transactions probably because ""it\'s where the money flow is"" and is ""low-hanging fruit"", said LawSoc vice-president M Rajaram.\xa0\n""Other types of scams involving law firms, such as corporate deals, have their own checks and balances,"" he said. ""(In) conveyancing, they are normally first-time buyers, elderly buyers, people who are not so sophisticated, so I guess the scammers look at this as low-hanging fruit and\xa0they go for this more than any other thing.""\xa0\nSIMILAR MODUS OPERANDI\nThe modus operandi in the two cases, which occurred within weeks of each other in April, was similar, said LawSoc.\nIn the first case, after a temporary occupation permit was issued, the solicitor sent the client a letter asking for payment of S$300,000, which was 25 per cent of the purchase price.\nThe lawyer then posted a hard copy letter to the client and sent the client an e-mail.\xa0\nThe client received the letter but not the email, as a scammer had hacked into her email account and intercepted it. The client posted a cheque with the payment to the solicitor and sent an e-mail requesting for the solicitor to acknowledge receipt, but the solicitor did not get this email either, as the scammer had intercepted the client\'s incoming and outgoing emails.\nThe scammer then began sending the client emails, posing as the solicitor by using a slightly altered version of the original email address, saying that the payment had to be by telegraphic transfer to a bank account instead of by cheque.\nThe client called her lawyer at least twice to ask why he had asked her to pay via telegraphic transfer, and the solicitor told her clearly that he had not sent her any such email.\nHowever, she felt pressured by the scammer\'s email reminders and transferred the money to the bank account provided.\nShe then sent the solicitor a WhatsApp message with a photo of the funds transfer form and emailed him a scanned copy of the form, which the scammer did not intercept.\nWhen the solicitor saw payment details on the funds transfer form, he immediately called his client to tell her to stop payment immediately, which was possible as her bank had not yet effected the payment.\xa0\xa0\nIn the second case, the scammer purchased a domain name very similar to the actual law firm\'s and hacked into the client\'s email account.\nPosing as the genuine solicitor, the scammer sent an email to the client saying the mode of payment had been changed from a cashier\'s order to a bank transfer and asked the client to transfer funds to a Bank of China account in Hong Kong.\nThe changes in the email addresses and domain names were as minute as a hyphen or full stop.\xa0For example, instead of ""lawyer [at] firstlaw.com.sg"", the scammer used ""lawyer [at] firstlaw-com.sg"".\nIn this case, the scammer also copied the lawyer\'s secretary in the email with a similarly altered email address.\nThis case was more sophisticated, said Mr Vijayendran, as the scammer had tampered with the law firm\'s letters by cutting and pasting onto them, and altering details.\nINVESTIGATIONS ONGOING, PUBLIC URGED TO BE VIGILANT\nBoth the law firm and client in the second\xa0case have made police reports and investigations are ongoing. LawSoc is not aware of any other similar cases at the moment.\nMr Vijayendran said the scammers in these cases had ""a canny awareness"" of the transactions, including the timeline of payments, but said there was nothing to show that ""this was an inside job"".\nThe lawyers\' email accounts were not compromised in these two cases, and he commended the law firms for flagging the cases.\nThe scams happened over the course of just a month, which is why LawSoc has ""made the unprecedented step of calling for a press conference"", said Mr Vijayendran. ""We were alarmed when we saw two transactions within a matter of weeks.""\xa0\n""The message out there is to be vigilant, to look at the senders, the emails, perhaps confirm with a phone call or some other means,"" said Mr Rajaram.\nIn the aftermath of the SingHealth cyber attack, LawSoc issued an advisory to all Singapore law practices and LawSoc members on procedures and practices they could adopt to safeguard against cyberattacks.\nThese include verification of a sender\'s identity if a suspicious email is received, by calling the person or checking their return or actual email address.\nLawSoc will be publishing cyber security guidelines for the legal profession later this year, said Mr Vijayendran.\nAfter the two recent scams, LawSoc advised its members to take specific precautions in a four-fold advisory. These include advising clients to verify with the law firms before effecting payments requested via email and to clearly inform clients who are not IT-savvy about payment instructions.\n""The Law Society advises clients of law practices to exercise caution when dealing with repeated emails sent purportedly from the law practice requesting them to effect funds transfer or payment by whatever mode,"" said LawSoc. ""They should contact their IT providers to assess whether their email accounts have been compromised in any way.""\n', 'related_topics': ['     crime ', '     law ']}"

      Justice, mercy and a long road to recovery: An in-depth look at criminals with mental illness in Singapore
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: When he was 18, Ng Say Tiong started taking heroin, egged on by bad company in the Tanjong Rhu area where he lived with his parents and two younger brothers.\xa0\nThe son of a coolie and a hawker was arrested and sentenced to three years in a Reformative Training Centre for taking drugs.\nHe continued to commit crimes after his release from the reformative training centre. For this, Say Tiong was jailed on more than 10 occasions, mostly for drug offences but also for hurting others. He would take drugs, drink alcohol and attack others with weapons when he felt enraged by what they said.\xa0\n“I would\xa0feel frustrated,” Say Tiong, now 61, told CNA in a mix of Mandarin and Hokkien. “When I’m frustrated, I cannot think (straight).”\nThe repeated heroin use, revolving door experience with prison and a brother with developmental problems weighed heavily\xa0on him. He said he felt sad and depressed.\nIn 2002, at the age of 44,\xa0he was diagnosed with depression by psychiatrists at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH)\xa0while serving a 10-year prison sentence.\nThere are others like Say Tiong, whose troubles and mental conditions form a backdrop against which they commit crime.\n1 IN 10 PRISONERS HAVE MENTAL DISORDERS, DEPRESSION \'MOST COMMON\'\nThe Singapore Prison Service (SPS) told CNA that about 10 per cent of prisoners here are diagnosed with mental disorders, the most common being insomnia, adjustment disorder and depressive episodes.\nCriminal defence lawyers told CNA that depression is perhaps the most common mental illness they have seen among accused persons.\nLawyer Sunil Sudheesan, who has handled about a thousand cases in his 14 years of practice, said about 300 to 400 of his clients had some sort of psychiatric issue, with depression being the most common.\n“The core of depression is that it results in a person behaving in a way which they would not normally behave because you can’t deal with your problems and therefore your ability to control your reactions sometimes is affected significantly,” he said.\xa0\nWhile mild depression may not excuse a person from criminal liability, lawyer Eugene Thuraisingam said severe or moderate depression can impair a person’s judgment and become a mitigating factor in sentencing.\nMr Shashi Nathan, a partner in criminal litigation at Withers KhattarWong, said: “Ultimately, there is also the issue of whether the mental illness has any causal link to the offence. For many persons, the mental illness is merely a condition which may not have a determining effect on the criminal act.”\nHOW ARE THEY TREATED IN PRISON?\nInmates with mental illnesses receive treatment for their conditions by a team of psychiatrists and medical officers while they are incarcerated. A team of correctional rehabilitation specialists and psychologists also give them counselling and therapy.\nAccording to Dr Christopher Cheok, senior consultant at IMH’s department of forensic psychiatry, the process in prison is no different from hospital clinics.\n“Patients are assessed, given medication\xa0as needed and provided with psychotherapy and occupational therapy. The only difference is that they are seen in a secure setting,” he said.\nHe added that the goals of treatment are the same - to reduce psychological suffering and manage the mental illness.\nDespite their condition, most will be assessed to be well enough to mingle with the general prison population and can be put through work and rehabilitation programmes.\nOnly those with severe mental conditions are separated from the general population. They are treated for their condition by a team of IMH psychiatrists, psychologists, and occupational therapists who work closely with SPS’ psychologists. The aim is to help these inmates understand and manage their mental disorders and prepare to reintegrate them into the general inmate population.\xa0\nWhile the law accords the same rights to people with mental illnesses as any other person, there are special provisions for those whom the court finds unfit to plead because they are of unsound mind, said a Ministry of Law (MinLaw) spokesman.\nTheir plea will not be taken and the court will order the person to be examined by a medical practitioner or remanded for observation in a psychiatric institution for up to a month.\nIf the medical practitioner certifies that the person is incapable of making his defence, the court may release him if it is certain that he will receive proper care and would not harm himself or others.\nThe alternative is for the matter to be referred to the Minister for Law, who may order the person to be confined in a psychiatric institution or any place of safe custody for treatment, said the spokesman.\nTheir mental state will be reviewed by independent experts at least once every six months and they may be discharged on the minister\'s order following a review, said MinLaw.\nEx-convicts may continue their treatment with IMH after their release from jail.\xa0The institute began the Forensic Psychiatry Community Service in 2012 to provide continued treatment and service to ex-convicts with a psychotic, affective or anxiety disorder diagnosis, supported by case managers and medical social workers. More than 460 patients who are ex-convicts have completed this voluntary one-year programme.\nAfter this one year period. they could either be transferred to IMH care teams handling the general patient population for treatment and support or receive care from community partners if their conditions are less complex and have stabilised.\nHOW ARE ACCUSED PERSONS WITH MENTAL ILLNESS DEALT WITH IN COURT?\nAccused people\xa0could be given non-jail sentences that focus on rehabilitation.\nSingapore\'s community court, which has a problem-solving approach and an emphasis on rehabilitation, was set up in 2006 for special cases including offenders with mental conditions.\nIt can now impose mandatory treatment orders (MTOs) for up to three years, where offenders must undergo psychiatric treatment as an alternative to imprisonment.\nOther than MTOs, the community court could impose community service orders; day reporting orders where offenders must present themselves to a reporting centre for monitoring, counselling and rehabilitation programmes; or short detention orders.\nFollowing recent changes to the Criminal Justice Reform Act, MTOs can be imposed on offenders convicted of a prescribed list of more serious offences, which are punishable with up to seven years’ imprisonment, up from offences punishable with up to three years’ jail.\nWHEN DOES MENTAL ILLNESS PLAY A PART?\nEach case is unique and is dealt with on its own set of circumstances, lawyers and psychiatrists told CNA.\nCriminal defence lawyer Eugene Thuraisingam said mental illness can come into play at two other stages in the court process, with the first in considering some defences in certain types of crime. For example, having a mental condition could allow a person accused of murder to argue for the defence of diminished responsibility, he said.\nThe second is in sentencing, where the courts could give a reduced punishment if an accused person’s mental illness is shown to have played a part in his commission of the offence.\xa0\nBut just because an accused person has a mental illness does not mean he gets a reduced sentence or a community-based sentence, and not all types of mental illnesses are given weight as a mitigating factor, they said.\nFor example, an accused person suffering from paedophilic disorder may not succeed in using that in mitigation, said Mr Thuraisingam as “it’s not the type of offence which affects your judgment”.\xa0\n“A paedophile is predisposed in a particular way but there’s nothing affecting his judgment as to whether to do something right or wrong. It must in a way affect your ability to resist (committing the crime),” he explained.\n“It is different for someone with impulse control (disorders) which affects his judgment on whether to do something or not,” he said.\xa0\n“In the event that the suspect is diagnosed with a mental disorder, the psychiatrists will further assess if this has impaired the suspect’s judgement at the point of committing the act,” said IMH’s Dr Cheok.\nPrivate psychiatrist Dr Munidasa Winslow, who was previously with IMH, said beyond making the assessment, he would also make recommendations to prevent the person from reoffending.\nThe judge will look at the psychiatric reports tendered by the prosecution and defence in coming to a decision on how much mitigating weight to give, if at all, to the offender’s mental condition.\nTHE JAIL QUESTION, AND HOW LIKELY RECOVERY IS\nJail time may not necessarily be the best option for accused persons with mental conditions, said lawyers.\nLawyer Mr Thuraisingam said: ""(For) a normal person, you jail him once, he will think - I don\'t want to do this again, because I don\'t want to go to prison. But a person who has mental illness may not think that way.""\nCriminal lawyer Sunil Sudheesan said jail is too ""short-term"".\xa0""Because you come out and there\'s nothing,"" he said.\xa0""You\'re left in the wilderness.""\nJail will not work ""all the more"" for recalcitrant offenders with mental conditions, as ""there needs to be a more interventionist sort of MTO"" which could involve a stay in a psychiatric institution, said Mr Sudheesan.\nHe cited the case of Goh Lee Yin, a woman diagnosed with kleptomania who committed suicide in 2017 after repeatedly being convicted of shoplifting.\n""You know the entire stigmatisation of the criminal justice process and the trauma involved there, sometimes it’s clearly too much for people to bear,” he said.\nPsychiatrist Dr Winslow who was involved in the case, said he knew she needed ""a lot more help for her mental condition"", adding that the legal criteria for how a condition contributes to a crime and mental health criteria ""are not exactly aligned all the time"".\nPROGRESS AND WHAT MORE CAN BE DONE\nBut Dr Winslow said he sees progress.\n“If they have committed a crime, they want to be able to punish them for the crime, but there’s a greater emphasis overall than when I first started in the 1980s towards restorative justice, they want to see that people who have mental health conditions get the help for those mental health conditions and that is something that I see a lot more strongly than before,” he said.\xa0\nMr Nathan said family members can also help by being more open about those with mental illnesses.\n""Pretending that a condition doesn\'t exist or sweeping it under the carpet could ultimately cause more harm to the offender. Ultimately, we all have to remove the stigma attached to mental illnesses,"" he said.\nDr Winslow added that there seems to be a greater awareness of mental health conditions that makes people more willing to talk about them to their lawyers or doctors.\xa0\nHe said the solution is for people to recognise if they have got issues, to persistently seek help and be aware that, sometimes, it takes time.\n“After you restore hope, and tell people you actually have a condition that can be treated, life can change,” he said. “Maybe I’m a little bit more of an optimist, but I think that even judges like to see lives saved rather than just putting people into prison.”\nSALVATION A LONG JOURNEY\nFor Say Tiong, salvation came after a long journey and near-death experiences.\xa0\nWhile he was in IMH after a referral there by the court, one of his ward mates asked him to join him in killing himself. His ward mate died, but Say Tiong was saved by a nurse and was later told that his mother had died the night before.\xa0\nHe had tried committing suicide seven or eight times in various ways over his lifetime - but was not fully cognisant that he suffered from depression until he was admitted to IMH on a court order.\n“I would think - I should die. Living has no meaning. I felt very sad,” he said. “I asked myself why did I become like this - I kept taking heroin, why did no one save me? Why was my mother in a wheelchair, and my brother had brain problems. I would drink and drink and drink, before smoking heroin.”\nLooking back on his life, Say Tiong said he took drugs as a form of escape each time.\nSay Tiong, who still visits IMH from time to time, has managed in recent years to cut down the dosage of the medication he takes for his depression.\nHe no longer leads a life of crime since his release from prison in 2012, after meeting a fellow inmate who introduced him to Christianity.\n“I took drugs because I felt frustrated - why would I take drugs, why did I take this road? I knew it was wrong, but I kept doing it. I couldn\'t help myself,” he said. ""Now I don\'t need to escape anymore. Now I am happy.""\n', 'related_topics': ['     crime ', '     mental health ', '     law ']}"

      France to approve ban on smacking children

      Gag orders: What to know about the legal provision that protects victims, 'vulnerable' witnesses
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: In court cases that have made the news, there is sometimes mention of gag orders that prevent\xa0the names of victims or suspects\xa0from being published.\xa0\nOne example is the recent high-profile Chin Swee Road murder case,\xa0where a gag order was\xa0imposed on the names of the couple accused of killing their two-year-old daughter.\xa0\nWhy are gag orders issued, can victims themselves violate it and what are the consequences of breaching such orders? We put the questions to lawyers.\n1. What is a gag order?\nApart from preventing the publishing of names, a gag order also covers addresses, photographs of the person in question and any other information or evidence that are likely to lead to the identification of the person.\xa0\nA court has the power to impose\xa0a gag order as defined in the\xa0State Courts Act and the Supreme Court of Judicature Act.\n2. Why impose a gag order?\n""Gag orders are usually imposed to protect minors, vulnerable persons and victims in sexual offence cases,"" said Nicholas Leong, associate at DC Law, adding that\xa0these categories are not necessarily mutually exclusive.\nIt may even be imposed on an accused person.\nLawyer\xa0Ashwin Ganapathy of IRB Law gave the example of\xa0a father who was charged with raping his daughter.\xa0The gag order is thus\xa0""imposed not so much as to protect the accused but to protect the victim"", said Mr Ashwin.\nGag orders have also been applied in cases involving state secrets,\xa0such as where the Official Secrets Act is violated, said\xa0Abraham Vergis from\xa0Providence Law Asia.\n3. Who does a gag order\xa0apply to?\xa0\nIt applies to everyone -\xa0including the media and members of the public, said\xa0Mr Vergis.\nIn the case of\xa0Chin Swee Road\xa0death, the gag order was violated after members of the public shared the suspects’ purported identities and photographs on Facebook, Mr Leong pointed out.\xa0\nThe\xa0Attorney-General’s Chambers\xa0had said on Wednesday (Sep 25) that it is looking into potential breaches of the gag order relating to the Chin Swee Road case.\n""We will not hesitate to take appropriate action to protect the administration of justice,"" it added.\n4. What are the consequences of violating a gag order?\nAnyone convicted of contravening a gag order issued by the court can be jailed for up to a year, fined a maximum of S$5,000, or both.\nThose who share a post in breach of the gag order can also be charged.\n5. Can a victim or witness protected by a gag order violate it on his or her\xa0own?\nAs gag orders apply to everyone - this means\xa0the person it was meant to protect cannot breach it as well.\n""However, it remains to be seen if a witness protected by a gag order would be sanctioned for any breach of the gag order, given that the gag order is meant for the protection of the witness,"" said Darren Tan from Invictus Law.\xa0\nThe scenario of a victim breaching the gag order ""appears to be rare or unheard of"", said IRB Law\'s Mr Ashwin.\nOn Friday, some media reports published the name of the purported victim who was\xa0molested by an NUS student,\xa0after she revealed her name online despite it being protected by a court order.\xa0\nThe victim\'s\xa0actions, however,\xa0do not give the media the right to publish her name, lawyers said.\xa0\n""Even if the person whose identity is the subject of the gag order was willing to be identified, the media cannot identify that person unless the gag order is lifted. Otherwise they would be in contempt of court for breaching a court order not to do so,"" said Mr Vergis.\n6. Who has the power to rescind a gag order?\nOnly the court has the power to remove the gag order.\xa0\n""This may happen if the identity of a witness has already been revealed to the public, rendering the gag order redundant, or where an argument is made that the witness is not within the class of persons that a gag order is meant to protect,"" said Invictus Law\'s Mr Tan.\xa0\nHowever, it would be ""very rare"" for a gag order to be reversed, said Tania Chin, partner at\xa0Withers KhattarWong.\nAgreeing, DC Law\'s Mr Leong said:\xa0""Considering the circumstances in which gag orders are usually made, the party that would attempt to do so would be better served by focusing instead on the merits of his own case.""\n', 'related_topics': ['     law ', '     crime ']}"

      Commentary: Rule of law is an 'existential necessity' for Singapore
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Let me begin by visiting an era that was no less troubled or unsettled. That was the time of the Peloponnesian War – a violent and sustained conflict that eventually saw the fall of Athens and the end of the golden age of ancient Greece.\nBy the summer of 416 BC, the Delian League, headed by Athens, had already been engaged in protracted warfare with the Peloponnesian League, led by Sparta, for 15 years.\xa0\nThroughout this time, the small but prosperous island of Melos in the Aegean Sea, roughly 110km east of mainland Greece, had remained strictly neutral. But their shared ethnicity with the Spartans, coupled with the imperialist ambitions of Athens, sufficed to trigger Athenian aggression.\nAthens demanded that Melos join the Delian League and pay tribute to Athens, but Melos bravely – or perhaps foolishly – refused.\xa0\nWith that, the wrath of the Athenians descended on Melos and the Siege of Melos began. 3,400 men, including heavy infantry and mounted archers rained fire and fury onto the peoples of that island.\xa0\nBy winter, Melos had surrendered but this was not enough to quell the rage of the Athenians, who executed the adult men, enslaved the women and children, and took the island for themselves.\nIn his seminal work the History of the Peloponnesian Wars, the Athenian historian and military commander Thucydides powerfully dramatised the negotiations between the Athenian emissaries and the rulers of Melos, in an\xa0exchange known as the Melian Dialogue.\xa0\nHe described the ultimatum given by the Athenian envoys to the commissioners of Melos in these terms: “The strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must!”\xa0\nThe message was clear: Justice was a lofty but ultimately irrelevant ideal in a political landscape dominated by the inequality of power.\nMoving 2,400 years forward into a comparable landscape, we see the painting of an entirely different picture.\xa0\nIn November 1945, just a few months after the end of World War II, Justice Robert Jackson, then serving as lead prosecuting counsel, opened the Nuremberg Trials with these immortal words: “That four great nations, flushed with victory and stung with injury, stay the hand of vengeance and voluntarily submit their captive enemies to the judgment of the law is one of the most significant tributes that power has ever paid to reason.”\nI suggest that the contrast between the declarations of Melos and Nuremberg speaks volumes about the progress that humanity has made. The former spoke of might as right, while the latter, of the subjugation of might to reason and justice.\xa0\nThe road from Melos to Nuremberg is a journey of faith in the law, indeed, in the rule of law. But that journey continues apace; and my thesis today is that for Singapore, the rule of law is not so much an aspirational ideal as it is an existential necessity.\nMy lecture today has three broad parts.\xa0\nFirst, I will propose some basic\xa0premises on how the rule of law might be understood in the international context.\xa0\nSecond, I will discuss whether the rule of law truly exists in the international legal order, and deal with two critiques that are sometimes raised to suggest that it does not.\xa0\nThird, I will explain my view that Singapore’s foreign policy as a small state is, and to a significant extent, has to be founded on the promotion and preservation of the international rule of law.\nTHE RULE OF LAW: WHAT EXACTLY IS IT?\nTo understand the place of the rule of law within the international legal order, we must first understand what the term means. The expression the “rule of law” is often used synonymously with “law” or “legality”, or even “justice”, but such definitions fail to capture its complexity and nuances.\xa0\nJurists and constitutional theorists have spilt much ink debating the precise scope and content of different conceptions of the rule of law, but the central idea is clear – the rule of law demands that all persons and entities, including states, be equally subject to rules which are publicly promulgated, equally enforced, and independently adjudicated.\nIf we were to review the historical origins of the rule of law, we will see that the concept was meant to be applied to states, in respect of matters falling within their legal systems, and in particular to address problems associated with an overly powerful centralised authority, so as to preserve space for individual autonomy even under the authority of the sovereign.\xa0\nThus, concepts such as\xa0the separation of powers, which is often regarded as central to the rule of law, exist comfortably within a vertical hierarchy involving a powerful sovereign.\nBut when we speak of the rule of law in the context of the international legal order – meaning the application of the concept between states – some change of perspective is necessary. There is no clear vertical hierarchy or sovereign to speak of.\xa0\nThe international legal order is premised on a different, and some might say the exact opposite, concern: That where authority is decentralised and atomistic, individual sovereign states are sometimes in a position to exert more autonomy than the common good can tolerate.\xa0\nHere, the concern is not to prevent the overreach of the central authority in order to preserve the autonomy of the individual, but rather to curb the “excess” autonomy of individual states in order to preserve the international legal order, for the sake of the common good.\nWriting in 1961, Professor William Bishop put forward an elegant summary of what the international rule of law entails. In his view, the international rule of law has the following components:\n… reliance on law as opposed to arbitrary power in international relations; the substitution of settlement by law for settlement by force; and the realisation that law can and should be used as an instrumentality for the cooperative international furtherance of social aims, in such fashion as to preserve and promote the values of freedom and human dignity for individuals.\nDOES THE RULE OF LAW EXIST ON THE INTERNATIONAL PLANE?\nProfessor Bishop’s definition is useful as far as it goes, but as with all definitions, it describes but does not prove. There remains considerable scepticism about whether the international rule of law, intelligible though it might be as a theoretical concept, actually exists.\xa0\nSome scholars have argued that international law is “ultimately limited by power, politics and the rule of force”, and that the rule of law is a mere ideal, a “leitmotif in international relations”.\xa0\nOne scholar has memorably remarked that the rule of law seems so extraneous to the actual practice of international law, which is wrought and riven by realpolitik,\xa0that it may almost be likened to “an accidental tourist at a diplomatic conference”.\nThis scepticism typically stems from two critiques. First, it is said that international law is not really “law” in any meaningful sense because there is nothing on the international plane that corresponds to the coercive power that a state possesses over its citizens.\nSecond, even if international law were really “law” in some sense, it does not meaningfully affect state behaviour because there is no system for ensuring that states comply with international legal norms. Let me address both critiques in turn.\nA. IS INTERNATIONAL LAW REALLY LAW?\nThe first critique is backed by what has been called the Austinian\xa0assumption, after the notable English legal theorist John Austin.\xa0\nThe argument proceeds in this manner: Laws are commands emanating from a sovereign and backed by the threat of enforcement using the sovereign’s organised might. Since such a sovereign does not exist on the international plane, international law cannot be law in any meaningful sense.\nThis command theory of law has been pervasively criticised for its oversimplification of law, and is no longer widely held. Professor H L A Hart, a leading legal philosopher, famously argued that the essence of law lies instead in the “internal aspect” of rules\xa0– that is, an attitude of acceptance in those who abide by them, and a reason for criticism of those who deviate from them.\xa0\nIn other words, it is the normativity of rules that is the defining quality of legal obligation. I will return to the critical issue of normativity later.\nIn addition, it is not clear that even domestic – much less international – law fulfils the Austinian criteria of “law” all the time.\xa0\nProfessor Roger Fisher has forcefully argued that much of domestic law too, does not depend upon the sovereign’s might. For example, in the critical context of proceedings for judicial review brought against the Government, one might argue that the Government complies with decisions that are not in its favour not because of any meaningful coercive force or power it possesses over itself, but rather because it chooses to comply with the law,\xa0or because it feels compelled to do so by the political pressures of the ballot box.\xa0\nEven in cases involving private citizens, it has been\xa0pointed out that rules concerning matters such as contractual obligations are obeyed not because of the state’s coercive power but because they are perceived to be just and necessary for the orderly functioning of society.\nI suggest that if we were briefly to survey the state of international compliance today, we would find that states, largely, do behave as if international law is truly “law”, notwithstanding the lack of a law-giving or coercive international sovereign.\xa0\nThis can be seen in the following ways: First, the sources of international law are well recognised;\xa0second, the rules governing the creation and effect of written legal norms such as treaties are widely accepted;\xa0and third, states generally do conduct their affairs according to the strictures of and the expectations inherent in international law.\xa0\nSome have claimed that great powers do not comply with the rulings of international courts when it is not in their interests to do so,\xa0but quantitative and qualitative analysis has shown that final judgments of international courts do receive a great deal of deference and compliance, and that instances of outright defiance are few and far between.\nIt therefore appears that the oft-quoted observation of Professor Louis Henkin, a renowned scholar in international law, still holds true today – that “almost all nations observe almost all principles of international law … almost all of the time”.\xa0\nViewed in this light, despite the absence of a coercive sovereign, the critique that international law is without force is simply inconsistent with\xa0observable reality and must therefore be discarded.\nB. THE INCREASING ENFORCEABILITY OF INTERNATIONAL LEGAL OBLIGATIONS\nI turn to the second critique, which concerns the enforceability of international legal obligations. I believe that this critique – if it ever were true – surely can no longer stand today, because international obligations today are perhaps more enforceable than ever before.\xa0\nI will illustrate this by focusing on just four different areas of comparatively recent legal development.\na) International courts and tribunals\n\nFirst, the world has seen a multiplication of permanent and active international courts and tribunals, presided over by independent judges who apply procedural and substantive rules of international law.\xa0\nWhile only a few such institutions existed as recently as 30 years ago, there are more than 20 international courts and tribunals today, ranging from the well-known International Court of Justice (“ICJ”) and the European Court of Human Rights to the administrative tribunals of international organisations such as the Asian Development Bank and NATO.\nNot only are there more international courts today, these courts are also doing more. They have collectively seen a tenfold increase in their caseload and judicial output in recent decades, and that has led in turn to a growing and vibrant body of international law.\nThis is significant because as Judge of the\xa0ICJ Sir Hersch Lauterpacht observed in 1958, the “very existence of the [ICJ], in particular when coupled with the substantial measure of obligatory jurisdiction already conferred upon it, must tend to be a factor of importance in maintaining the rule of law”.\nMoreover, the reach of these tribunals has also expanded over time. A striking example of this is the advisory opinion of the ICJ delivered in February this year, in which the Court held that the decolonisation of Mauritius in 1968 had not been lawfully completed because the UK had wrongfully detached the Chagos Islands from Mauritius.\xa0\nNotably, the ICJ decided that it had jurisdiction to provide an advisory opinion on this matter, notwithstanding that opinions on bilateral disputes can typically only be issued with the consent of both parties, and such consent had not been given by the UK in this instance.\nThe ICJ side-stepped the problem by framing the issue as one pertaining to the “broader frame” of decolonisation rather than a territorial dispute, emphasising that the UN General Assembly has had a “long and consistent record in seeking to bring colonialism to an end”.\nIt has been observed that the ICJ’s reasoning evinces its increasing tendency to give precedence to multilateral interests over bilateral concerns, as it embraces its role as the UN’s “principal judicial organ”.\xa0\nAlthough advisory opinions are not legally binding on states, they do carry considerable weight as a statement of the international legal position.\xa0\nIn the Chagos Islands case, the\xa0UN General Assembly welcomed the ICJ’s advisory opinion later in May, affirming in a resolution that “respect for the Court and its functions, including in the exercise of its advisory jurisdiction, is essential to … an international order based on the rule of law”.\nb) Privatisation of international law\xa0\nSecond, the enforceability of international legal obligations has been supported by the growing privatisation of international law.\xa0\nThis is reflected in both the increasing focus of international law on the rights and interests of individuals, reflected in such issues as dual nationality, consular assistance or the detention of foreigners,\xa0as well as the growing procedural capacity of individuals to hold states accountable for violations of international law, on matters extending from human rights to economic and social interests.\nThis increasing empowerment of individuals and enterprises on the international plane is most notable in the area of investor-state dispute settlement (“ISDS”), which allows foreign investors to bring claims directly against the host state, usually by way of arbitration.\xa0\nISDS mechanisms tend to be less cumbersome and more cost-effective than conventional state-to-state dispute resolution. That has fueled the growing popularity of ISDS: In the 15-year period from 1987 to 2002, some 100 claims were initiated in investor-state arbitrations, but in the decade that followed, a total of 568 claims were filed.\nIt is true that ISDS has faced increasing political pushback in recent years, arising primarily from the concern that tribunals are impinging on state sovereignty by deciding matters of domestic policy that ought to be reserved to national governments and courts.\nAt the same time, the UN Conference on Trade and Development has warned of deficiencies in ISDS, including its “skyrocket[ing]” costs, long timeframes, lack of control over arbitral procedures, and general concerns about the legitimacy of the process;\xa0and others have suggested that ISDS suffers from a “legitimacy crisis” because its outcomes are reached through a private and non-transparent process but affect matters of public interest such as the economy and the environment.\nDoubts over the viability of ISDS came into sharp focus in the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (“CJEU”) in Achmea last year,\xa0which, some have suggested, marks the “beginning of the end” for ISDS in Europe.\nIn Achmea, the CJEU ruled that an arbitration clause in a bilateral investment treaty between the Netherlands and Slovakia was incompatible with EU law because the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU did not permit the removal of disputes concerning the application or interpretation of EU law from the EU’s judicial system.\xa0\nAlthough it is too early to ascertain the full impact of Achmea,\xa0it now appears to be difficult to enforce ISDS awards before the EU’s domestic courts,\xa0and that is particularly unfortunate for European investors,\xa0who have been the most frequent users of ISDS.\nWhile headwinds blow in the way of the continued growth of ISDS, there remain many who are committed to preserving its contribution to the maintenance of the international legal order.\xa0\nSingapore, for one, has participated actively in the international dialogue to develop a fair, workable and cost-effective ISDS framework.\xa0\nNew ideas include the establishment of a body to hear appeals against decisions of arbitral tribunals, and even the replacement of investor-state arbitration with a permanent investment court so as to improve the consistency and correctness of decisions and guarantee the independence of adjudicators.\xa0\nThe global interest in ISDS has also led the UN Commission of International Trade Law to task one of its Working Groups to make recommendations on reform.\nDespite its shortcomings, I believe that ISDS has the potential to prevent instances of more powerful states favouring their own nationals through diplomatic or military interventions in weaker host states.\xa0\nIn many ways, this embodies the very ideal of the rule of law. With suitable refinements, investment disputes will prove capable of resolution through fair, neutral and regulated processes, insulated from the influences of state power or corporate interests.\nc) International sanctions\xa0\nThird, enforcement may come in the form of sanctions that interrupt flows of trade and commerce or even sever diplomatic relations.\xa0\nThe UN Security Council is empowered by Article 41 of the UN Charter to decide the measures needed to give effect to its decisions, and to call upon members of the UN to apply those measures.\xa0\nOver the past 50 years, the UN Security Council has established 30 sets of sanctions,\xa0amongst the most prominent of which are the near-total financial and trade embargo imposed on Ba’athist Iraq over the span of almost two decades, following its invasion of Kuwait in 1990,\xa0and the institution of nearly a dozen embargoes on North Korea, condemning its nuclear pursuits.\nThe justifiability and efficacy of sanctions are the subject of continued controversy.\xa0\nSome have denounced economic sanctions as a “form of collective punishment that is in total contradiction to the basic principles of justice and human rights”.\xa0\nWhile the sanctions against Iraq are generally regarded as having been effective in limiting the availability of arms to the regime, it is estimated that more than half a million Iraqi children died from malnutrition and disease as a result.\xa0\nThe effectiveness of sanctions can also be uneven. A study has shown that 56 countries violated UN sanctions against North Korea in 2018, whether deliberately or inadvertently.\xa0\nOthers argue that these sanctions have in fact done little to deter Pyongyang from its nuclear ambitions,\xa0conditioned as the country has become to the human costs of the sanctions.\nQuite apart from their effectiveness in coercing or punishing targeted states, sanctions undoubtedly have an important communicative function. They remain a potent signal of the international community’s condemnation of norm violations and its willingness to act powerfully, but peacefully, to maintain the international rule of law.\nd) Soft enforcement\xa0\nFourth, we are seeing an increase in what can be called “soft enforcement”, by which states review and critique the compliance of other states with their international law obligations.\xa0\nPerhaps the best known of these mechanisms is the Universal Periodic Review (“UPR”) organised by the UN Human Rights Council. Every four years, states submit “national reports” declaring the actions they have taken to improve their human rights situations.\nUN member states then pose questions and make recommendations to the state under review, and these are collated in an “outcome report”. At a subsequent review, the state has to give an account of the progress it has made in implementing those recommendations.\nIt is true that the UPR is a political process and that its recommendations are not legally binding. It should also be acknowledged that aside, possibly, from a core of rights that are widely accepted, there will be considerable differences\xa0of perspectives in a multi-polar and diverse world.\xa0\nTo take just one example, the debate in Europe on the use of headscarves by Muslim women would seem quite foreign to most of us in this part of the world.\xa0\nNonetheless, the UPR has been fairly credited for promoting the protection of human rights.\xa0Out of over 60,000 recommendations made over the past three UPR cycles, more than 70 per cent\xa0have been supported by the states under review.\xa0\nThe UPR process has even had the legal effect of building opinio juris – or consensus on norms of international law – in the field of international human rights.\nCollective soft enforcement is also a key feature of treaties on environmental protection.\nAn example is the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, which has been ratified by no less than 197 states and hailed by the former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan as “perhaps the single most successful international agreement to date”.\nSuch a demonstration of multilateralism is so very welcome, at a time when climate change and the environment present some of the gravest challenges facing humanity.\xa0\nCentral to the success of the Protocol has been its “noncompliance procedure”, which encourages compliance through the “collective reaction” of other contracting states and the “mobilisation of shame”, rather than confrontation and formal dispute settlement.\xa0\nA state’s reasons for non-compliance are placed before a meeting of the other contracting states, which then decide how to assist the non-complying state to carry out its obligations.\xa0\nThis “encouragement-based approach”\xa0has been lauded as a “great step forward in strengthening …\xa0collective state compliance … [with] international environmental law”.\nC. THE EXISTENCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW\nLet me pause to draw these threads together and revisit the question I posed earlier: Does the international rule of law exist in any real or binding way today? Has the world retreated from its pledge in the preamble of the UN Charter to “establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained”?\nI suggest that although there are moments when it has been greatly strained, sometimes almost to breaking point, the international rule of law remains alive today. I say this for three broad reasons.\xa0\nFirst, the international rule of law is sustained by the rule of international law. I have explained that the body of international law has perhaps never been as comprehensive, accessible or vibrant as it is today, fed by the tributaries of various international courts and tribunals, and backed by multiple means and levels of enforcement.\xa0\nThe interconnectedness of the world today has fostered an unprecedented level of interdependence, with the consequence that no state can sustainably or meaningfully operate beyond the net of international obligations; nor can it suffer for long – at least not without immense cost – the weight of international sanctions.\xa0\nA country that repeatedly repudiates and disrespects international law will also inevitably be labelled as a pariah and suffer the consequences of\xa0diplomatic isolation and global disapproval.\nThe second reason is this: The enforceability of international law has been promoted by its normative value. Law is an instrument for changing behaviour because it has an important constitutive effect. By shaping our conceptions of what is right and wrong, it moulds our identities and guides our preferences.\nThis means that it is in fact normativity that paves the way for enforcement, not the other way around.\xa0To put it another way, collective actions become effective when and because they are seen as being the right response.\xa0\nJames Brierly illustrates the point with the example of a police force, noting that, “it is not the existence of a police force that makes a system of law strong and respected, but the strength of the [system of] law that makes it possible for a police force to be effectively organised…”\nThis means that as long as a sufficiently large majority of the international community values and sustains the international rule of law, the normativity of international law will encourage the continued compliance of states.\xa0\nAs our former Foreign Minister Mr S\xa0Dhanabalan once said, “accepted legal prohibitions against the use of force … ensures that states can only resort to force with a bad conscience”.\nThe need to justify the use of force is itself a form of constraint, because no state wishes to be seen as a bandit roaming the highway of the international rule of law.\nThe field of international criminal justice, and the move towards what\xa0has been called the “end of impunity”, provides a sterling example of how normativity changes perspectives, influences behaviour and even drives enforcement.\xa0\nOne of Nuremberg’s enduring contributions to international criminal jurisprudence was its rejection of the notion, quite widely accepted until then, that individuals could not be put on trial for acts committed by states.\xa0\nThis was an untenable position because, as the tribunal remarked, “Crimes against international law are committed by men, not by abstract entities, and only by punishing individuals who commit such crimes can the provisions of international law be enforced”.\xa0That has paved the way for the indictments of such individuals as Jean Kambanda of Rwanda, Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia and Augusto Pinochet of Chile.\nAnd the third reason is this: Even when normativity fails, and the light of reason and friendship dims, we can turn to self-interest to sustain international peace and order.\xa0\nThe reality of a globalised world means that in the long run, it is in the best interests of all states, regardless of their size and swagger, to play by the rules.\xa0\nProfessor Harold Koh has observed that great powers that seek domination by might have historically become victims of “imperial overstretch”, “plagued by external debt, national exhaustion and internal dissension”.\xa0\nThe more effective use of power and strength is to influence and persuade by espousing the common values of international law, and thereby gaining legitimacy through “smart power”.\xa0\nThe inescapable reality is that outright unlawfulness will lead to catastrophe for all, in the form of destructive wars,\xa0reprisals without winners, and a trail of casualties. And so, the international rule of law emerges as a critical reality – a survival strategy for the vulnerable, an essential condition for those seeking to assert moral leadership, and the very fabric holding together an interdependent world.\nBut what happens in the moments when the international rule of law cracks, and the scales of principle and solidarity fall away? Even in a climate of general respect for the international rule of law, there will be times when powerful states decide that the balance of self-interest tilts in favour of aggression rather than peaceful co-existence and respect for the law.\xa0\nWhen the Soviet Army invaded Afghanistan in December 1979, the world reeled from the flagrant violation of international law. The UN General Assembly passed a resolution at an emergency special session, deploring Soviet aggression and calling for a return to “respect [for] sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence”.\xa0\nJust a month before that, Iranian students took over the US Embassy in Tehran, marking the beginning of the Iran hostage crisis. The Iranian authorities, under the leadership of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khomeini, supported the hostage-takers.\xa0\nThe US appealed to the ICJ for provisional measures and the ICJ ordered the immediate release of the hostages on the basis that there is “no more fundamental prerequisite for the conduct of relations between states than the inviolability of diplomatic envoys and embassies”.\xa0\nEven so, it was not until 444 days later, with the passing of the Algiers Accords and a series of concessions by the US, that the hostages\xa0were finally released.\nThese and other moments through history reveal that the narrative of the international rule of law is not uninterrupted, just as domestic laws are sometimes breached.\xa0\nBut within these interregnums, the very existence of small states may hang in the balance.\xa0As Mr Rajaratnam said on the occasion of Singapore’s admission to the UN in 1965, “world peace is a necessary condition for the political and economic survival of small countries, like Singapore … because we have not the capacity to make war on anybody.”\nHow can small states preserve their sovereignty during these moments of anarchy? What kind of appeal can they make when more powerful states decide that the spoils of war are worth the price of aggression?\nTHE FOREIGN POLICY OF SMALL STATES: WHAT DOES ALL THIS MEAN FOR SINGAPORE?\nThis brings me to the final part of my lecture today and also to the present moment, when the world once again seems to be at a point of inflexion.\xa0\nRecent years have seen a global revival of nationalism in the political landscapes of advanced economies. Politicians have campaigned and won on protectionist agendas which have then, at times, been translated into policy.\xa0\nIn its wake, some say we have seen something of a “gradual decay of the international order that emerged after World War II” and increasing disregard for the international rule of law, which seems susceptible to being subordinated\xa0to the vicissitudes of domestic politics.\xa0\nCountries seem to adopt a zero-sum mentality in eschewing multilateral agreements as “shackles on sovereignty and a burden on economic growth”.\nWhat does this “gradual decay of the international order” mean for small states such as ours? How should we navigate an increasingly polarised world order that seems more ready to resort to threats, trade wars, and tribalism?\xa0\nI believe that the answer lies in five core principles that frame Singapore’s foreign policy. These were identified by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, about two years ago in a speech to the MFA,\xa0and have also been points of emphasis throughout the lectures in the S Rajaratnam series. Let me take a moment to outline them.\nThe first principle is the need to sustain our successful and vibrant economy, because our international standing is founded in part on the policies that have made us prosperous and lent us relevance as a centre of trade and finance.\xa0\nThe Minister Mentor Mr Lee Kuan Yew observed at the beginning of his S Rajaratnam Lecture in 2009 that Singapore’s “economic imperative” is to ensure “that other countries have an interest in our continued survival and prosperity as a sovereign and independent nation”.\xa0Hence, an effective foreign policy must begin at home.\nSecond, we must maintain a strong and respected defence force that can deter potential hostility. At the 2012 S Rajaratnam Lecture, then Deputy\xa0Prime Minister Mr Teo Chee Hean remarked that diplomacy and defence in Singapore are “twins”, with the Singapore Armed Forces as the “final guarantor of our sovereignty”.\xa0In turn, our defence force must be backed by a society that is resilient, stable and united in the face of external threats.\nThird, we must continue to expand our network of political and economic relationships. This involves being an active and contributing member of multilateral groups such as ASEAN, the Forum of Small States, and the Global Governance Group.\xa0\nThese fora provide a broader stage upon which we can advocate our interests, influence regional policies and, in this way, have a louder voice in the global marketplace. In the same vein, at a recent reception for members of the Forum of Small States, Prime Minister Mr Lee Hsien Loong spoke emphatically about the need for small states to “make common cause”, coming together to “amplify [their] influence in the world”.\nClosely tied to this is the fourth principle, which is our promotion of an international legal order that respects reason rather than force. Over the years, we have done much good work in this sphere, ranging from our contributions to the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea in 1982 and the facilitation of key sections of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change in 2015, to our efforts in spearheading the recent Singapore Convention on Mediation.\nThe fifth and final principle is the need for consistency and credibility in our inter-state relationships, or being what the Foreign Minister called an\xa0“honest broker” in international affairs: An independent, non-aligned and constructive member of the international community that “cannot be bought, nor … bullied”.\xa0\nThat involves committing to principle, steadfastly adhering to our international obligations, and – as Professor Jayakumar pointed out in the 2010 S Rajaratnam Lecture – equally “insist[ing] that agreements entered into in good faith should be honoured” by others.\nI suggest that all of these principles – relevance, defence, diplomacy, legality and consistency – are intimately associated with the rule of law, whether at the domestic or international level.\xa0\nOur economic success is underpinned by a legal system that is fair, efficient and well-respected. The effectiveness of our national defence is founded on a society that is stable, orderly and law-abiding.\xa0\nWe interact with other states and participate in international organisations in a manner consistent with our international obligations and we expect other states to do the same. And the “strategic predictability”\xa0that underpins our credibility as a trusted and neutral voice is inextricable from our sustained loyalty to international law.\nIt is for all these reasons, and at all these various levels, that the pursuit of the rule of law lies at the very heart of our foreign policy.\xa0\nThe rule of law is and has been the lynchpin of our economic success and this has earned us the world’s respect.\xa0It is the ethical code that governs our conduct on the international stage. And it is the message that we take to an increasingly\xa0fractious and divided world that appears at times to be retreating from multilateralism.\xa0\nI suggest that the rule of law is also the strategy that will sustain us in an age of interdependence. As I mentioned earlier, no state can afford to violate the rights of others without risking exclusion from the international community, or having its rights violated in the same way by some other state.\xa0\nThe best strategy for small states unable to directly defend themselves is to create the conditions that will best promote their survival – and that is the world of Nuremberg, not of Melos.\nIn the Melian Dialogue, the Melian commissioners appealed first to morality, examining whether the Athenians had “right on [their] side”. The Athenian envoys had little difficulty in admitting that what they had was might and not right. The Melians suggested they were favoured by the gods as “just men fighting against unjust”, but the Athenians countered that the gods would do just as the Athenians did, and “rule wherever they [could]”.\xa0\nFinally, the Melians argued that the Spartans would come to their aid, as a people of “common blood”. The Athenian envoys countered that the Spartans would not risk defeat at the hands of the superior Athenian navy. Shocked by the Melians’ “great blindness of judgment”, the envoys returned to the army, which then fell upon Melos.\nThe moral of Melos is not bravery in the face of overwhelming odds, but the need to remain deeply conscious of geopolitical realities. To be fair, Melos\xa0faced a very different world order; and in a far less interconnected region dominated by two superpowers, a small island was bound to struggle.\xa0\nEven so, the Melians’ mistake was perhaps to rely on fickle things – like the persistence of good relations, faith in good fortune, or the backing of a good neighbour.\xa0\nTruth be told, small states can never survive on pious hope alone. Without might on their side, they must rely on their own wits and ingenuity.\xa0\nAs the Minister Mentor said in his lecture, “[f]riendship, in international relations, is not a function of goodwill or personal affection. … Small countries perform no vital or irreplaceable functions in the international system. Singapore has to continually reconstruct itself and keep its relevance to the world and to create political and economic space.”\nOver the last 54 years, we have worked hard to carve out that relevance and that space by a considered strategy rooted in a sustained commitment to the rule of law, and it has served us well. But what of the future? I believe this same strategy must continue to guide us.\nI suggest that across the passage of the years from the Peloponnesian War to the present, three mega-trends have shaped the world.\xa0\nFirst, a world that was once parochial and insular has become hyper-connected and highly interdependent, and it rapidly continues to converge.\xa0\nThe second is the extraordinary advancement of human knowledge and, with it, our ever greater expertise in the science of destruction. The Second World War brought death\xa0on an unprecedented scale, effected by automatic rifles, gas chambers and aerial bombardments, and it culminated in the atom bomb.\xa0\nDuring the Cold War, the development of second-strike capability in retaliation to a nuclear attack supported the strategy of Mutual Assured Destruction or just “MAD”.\xa0\nThe Battle of Baghdad in 2003 showcased the killing prowess of modern technology as computer-guided missiles brought the “shock and awe” of the Coalition attack to the living rooms of billions.\nThese two trends – the inescapable reality of interdependence and the ability of even a second tier power to annihilate its enemy – have led inevitably to the third and more recent, but no less obvious, trend, which is the increasing realisation of the need to regulate the behaviour of states through law.\xa0\nLaw alone provides a measure of assurance, of predictability and of order. In the final analysis, I suggest that fidelity to the law is the only acceptable solution.\xa0\nThe alternative is a descent into anarchy; and that, in a world that has become so interdependent and at the same time so able to inflict destruction on an incalculable scale, spells doom not only for small states but indeed for much of humanity.\nCONCLUSION: STAYING THE COURES\nOur future then lies not in the naïve tactic of tethering our fate to whoever we think is the strongest power, for that will mean reducing ourselves to the status of a vassal.\xa0\nAnd in any case, history teaches us that what goes around,comes around. Merely a decade after the Siege of Melos, Athens was defeated by Sparta, though that was 10 years too late for the unfortunate Melians.\xa0\nRather, our future lies in intentionally, deliberately and continually carving out our space as a relevant, rational, and consistent partner in our international dealings and displaying an inerrant and insistent commitment to the international rule of law, even if this might prove at times to be inexpedient.\xa0\nThe long arc of history teaches us that a mighty power might be able to bully some of the rest of us most of the time, and most of the rest of us some of the time.\xa0\nBut when we find ourselves at the receiving end of such bullying, we should pull all the levers of our foreign policy strategy and remain confident that in today’s world, no power can bully all of us, all of the time.\nThe drama of Thucydides’ ancient Greece has long faded away, as have the passions of the Nuremberg Trials. We now inhabit a post-Nuremberg, Westphalian 21st Century.\xa0\nThe relative stability that we have enjoyed on the domestic and international front has been due in large part to the respect for the rule of law, but we cannot and must not take this for granted.\xa0\nAgainst the challenges of our own age, I suggest that we must continue to hold ourselves out not only as faithful adherents to, but as staunch defenders of, this ideal.\nSundaresh Menon is\xa0the Chief Justice of Singapore.\n', 'related_topics': ['     law ']}"

This extends to any man who abets such an act, procures or attempts to procure such an act.\nThe challenges were mounted by three men: Johnson Ong Ming, a 43-year-old disc jockey and producer; Dr Roy Tan Seng Kee, a 61-year-old retired general practitioner; and 42-year-old Bryan Choong, the former executive director of LGBT non-profit organisation Oogachaga.\nLawyer Johannes Hadi, who is representing Mr Ong with Suang Wijaya and Eugene Thuraisingam, told CNA that the lawyers will aim to prove that ""homosexuality is a natural variant of sexual orientation in humans"".\n""If we can prove this, then section 377a is not just an absurd law because it criminalises homosexual adults for who they are and what they do in private, but also discriminatory,"" said Mr Hadi.\xa0\nHe said this would offend articles in the constitution which prohibit the deprivation of life or personal liberty save in accordance with law and which mandates that all persons are equal before the law and entitled to the equal protection of the law.\xa0\nLawyer M Ravi also said that the principle he will be relying on for his client Dr Tan is that 377A ""infringes right to equality before the law and equal protection of the law, under Article 12(1) of the constitution"".\n""Identical conduct occurring in private between males and females, or between females, would not constitute a criminal offence and be subject to investigation and penalty.""\nThe case will be heard in chambers in the High Court, before Justice See Kee Oon, from Wednesday afternoon.\nCHALLENGE COMES AFTER FORMER CHIEF JUSTICE\'S\xa0COMMENTS\nLast month, former Chief Justice Chan Sek Keong called for a review of 377A in a paper published online on Oct 14.\nHe said that the law was a product of specific social conditions that have long ceased to exist in Singapore.\nHis comments came after former attorneys-general Professor Walter Woon and V K Rajah pointed out that the section poses a constitutional problem given the Government\'s position on the law.\xa0\nIn response to Prof Woon\'s and Mr Rajah\'s comments, Attorney-General Lucien Wong said in a media statement on Oct 2 last year that the public prosecutor retains ""full prosecutorial discretion"" with respect to section 377A.\nMr Wong said the Government\'s position on it was that the police would not proactively enforce it such as by conducting raids, but will investigate if reports of offences are lodged under Section 377A.\nVarious religious groups and leaders have spoken out against the repeal of 377A, with the Archbishop of Singapore saying that accepting homosexual acts as a social norm would have ""dreadful consequences""\xa0for the stability of families, the well-being of children and bring long-term and irreversible risks to the common good.\nLast year,\xa0Law and Home Affairs\xa0Minister K Shanmugam highlighted how society is ""deeply split"" on the issue, with a majority of people opposing any change but with a growing minority wanting it to be repealed.\n', 'related_topics': ['     law ']}"

      Former lawyer from top firm reinstated 11 years after Hong Kong burglary conviction
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: A former lawyer from a top firm in Singapore who was disbarred in 2010 because of a burglary conviction in Hong Kong was reinstated as a local advocate and solicitor on Tuesday (Nov 19).\nFormer Rajah & Tann lawyer Choy Chee Yean was granted his application to be reinstated as an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court of Singapore by the Court of Three Judges.\nThe panel, comprising Judge of Appeal Andrew Phang and Justices Belinda Ang and Chao Hick Tin, found that his case was an ""exceptional one"".\nMr Choy had been convicted of burglary in Hong Kong in 2008 for stealing items including a bag, a charger, a mobile phone and an iPod from a hotel room there.\nHe was sentenced to a year\'s jail and suspended for two years by a Hong Kong district court, and Mr Choy wrote to the Law Society (LawSoc) to inform them of his conviction.\nHe also voluntarily suspended himself from practice for two years, before being disbarred in 2010.\xa0\nBoth Mr Choy\'s lawyer and the lawyers representing LawSoc and the Attorney-General agreed for him to be reinstated, with certain conditions.\nMr Choy\'s lawyer, Ms Aurill Kam from Legal Clinic, told the court that her client was suffering from major depressive disorder at the time of the offence.\nThe court found that his dishonesty was manifested in ""a one-off case"", at a time when he was under psychological stress.\nThe court heard he was under a tremendous amount of pressure from work, his family, and expectations of his career.\nIn the time since, he has taken time to reflect, reprioritise and reorder his life, said Ms Kam.\nHe has also ""followed his passion for the law by undertaking a range of law-related work"", she said.\nThese include legal knowledge management, in-house legal counsel work, paralegal support work and legal publication particularly in building and construction law, which is his area of interest.\n""In all these different roles he\'s kept himself abreast of legal developments and he has worked closely with clients as well as with members of the bar,"" said Ms Kam, who also showed the court testimonials from clients and senior members of the bar.\nMr Choy has since been certified as mentally and psychologically fit for active legal practice. He has not required psychiatric treatment since 2010.\n""He has learned from his mistakes and is now fully recovered and rehabilitated,"" said the lawyer.\nMr Sanjiv Rajan Kumar, who acted for LawSoc, told the court that he felt Mr Choy was a suitable candidate for reinstatement, citing a testimonial that said the courts and the bar ""would benefit hugely from Mr Choy\'s admission"".\nThe judges said they were satisfied that the waiting period of 11 years, including Mr Choy\'s voluntary cessation of legal practice, was a sufficient length of time before reinstatement.\nJustice Phang noted the certification by Mr Choy\'s psychiatrist that he was not in any depressive condition and was both mentally and psychologically fit to return to professional legal practice.\nHE KEPT HIMSELF GAINFULLY EMPLOYED IN LEGAL INDUSTRY: JUDGE\nHe added that Mr Choy had ""kept himself in gainful employment while demonstrating a willingness to continuously engage with the law"".\nHowever, he noted that a person previously struck off the roll for grossly improper conduct must be subjected to stricter scrutiny to be reinstated compared with a new entrant to the profession with no such record.\n""It concerns the protection of the public interest and public confidence in the general reputation of the legal profession,"" said the judge.\nHowever, he said there was a collective interest in the rehabilitation and redemption of applicants and a second chance should be offered to those ""genuine in their contrition"".\nMr Choy\'s act of dishonesty in the burglary offence ""stemmed from an exceptional situation of psychiatric disorder"", said the judge, adding that he is unlikely to suffer from a relapse.\nHowever, four conditions were imposed to send a clear signal that the reinstatement of a disbarred advocate and solicitor ""is a serious matter, and that practical measures will be put in place to protect the interests of potential clients"".\nAmong the conditions,\xa0Mr Choy is prevented from assuming a position as a partner, director or sole proprietor for a year.\nMr Choy is currently looking at his options and will be returning to practice, his lawyer told the media after the hearing.\nMr Choy said in a statement through his lawyer that he has learned many lessons over the past decade.\n“We often hear and learn best when pain speaks to us as a loudspeaker. I am very grateful to the court, the Law Society and the Attorney-General for giving me a second chance to practise law again,"" he said.\n""This is a new chapter in my professional life and one where I am excited to be able to once again use the privileges accorded to lawyers to better contribute to society.""\n', 'related_topics': ['     law ']}"

He threatened to make the bar manager lose his job, and said he was a lawyer.\nSensing that the matter might escalate further, the bar manager escorted Karunakaran out of the pub with the help of a security officer.\nOutside, Karunakaran hurled vulgarities at the bar manager at least 10 times and insisted on wanting to return to the pub to drink more alcohol.\nThe security officer called the police and Karunakaran was later arrested.\nThe prosecution asked for a custodial or short jail term, but did not indicate a specific sentence in its submissions.\nHe said Karunakaran had ""brazenly violated three women in a pub"", committing six offences against them in his drunken stupor.\xa0\nHe quoted a report by the Singapore Police Force in February this year that molestation offences in nightspots and public transport remain a concern.\n""From 2017 to 2018, there had been an increase of 11.9 per cent\xa0in total outrage of modesty (OM) cases, and an increase of 34.3 per cent of OM cases at nightspots,"" he said.

      Three court challenges to Section 377A: A summary of key arguments
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Three men, flanked by a host of lawyers, took to the High Court this past week to mount challenges to the law that criminalises sex between men, which they claim\xa0to be unconstitutional.\nThe challenges were mounted by\xa0Johnson Ong Ming, a 43-year-old disc jockey and producer; Roy Tan Seng Kee, a 61-year-old retired general practitioner; and 42-year-old Bryan Choong Chee Hoong, the former executive director of LGBT non-profit organisation Oogachaga.\nThe arguments were made in chambers\xa0before Justice See Kee Oon and ended on Wednesday (Nov 20),\xa0two days ahead of schedule, with a verdict to be released later.\nAll previous challenges against\xa0Section 377A have failed.\xa0\nThe court actions taken this time come after former Chief Justice Chan Sek Keong called for a review of Section 377A in a paper published online on Oct 14, with two former attorneys-general also making public comments on the law.\nAccording to Section 377A of the Penal Code, any man who commits any act of gross indecency with another man in public or in private can be jailed for up to two years. This extends to any man who abets such an act, procures or attempts to procure such an act.\nThe Attorney-General Chambers\xa0(AGC) has argued that\xa0""gross indecency"" here covers both penetrative and non-penetrative sex acts between men.\nCertain criminal laws were repealed in 2007 as they were deemed to no longer reflect\xa0societal norms and values in Singapore.\xa0Consensual heterosexual oral and anal sex between adults were\xa0also decriminalised.\nSection 377A was, however, not repealed, with a near-unanimous vote by parliament\xa0deciding then\xa0that the status quo ""struck the correct balance between the majority conservative view on the one hand, and recognising that homosexuals are part of and have a place in Singapore society on the other"", read AGC\'s submissions.\nWhat follows are the key arguments that were put forward by lawyers in each case, as well as the submissions on behalf of the Attorney-General (AG), who was listed as the respondent in the cases.\nCase 1: Bryan Choong Chee Hoong\nLawyers: Harpreet Nehal Singh,\xa0Remy Choo Zheng Xi, Priscilla Chia, Wong Thai Yong, Jordan Tan\nORIGINAL AIM WAS TO ADDRESS MALE PROSTITUTION\nMr Choong\'s lawyers argued that recently declassified documents demonstrate that the introduction of Section 377A in 1938 was to criminalise ""rampant male prostitution"" in a time when Singapore was under British colonial rule, and it\xa0now has ""no legitimate objective"".\n""The legislative purpose was never to target private, non-commercial acts of sexual intimacy between consenting male adults,"" they said.\nThe lawyers argued that Section 377A targets only commercial sexual acts committed by and with male prostitutes, and that it does not criminalise penetrative sex.\nThe new historical material was not available during a 2014 appeal by Lim Meng Suang against the gay sex law, which failed.\nThe lawyers presented crime reports from 1937 which\xa0showed a ""heightened and urgent increase in concern \'for the newly discovered\'\xa0widespread existence for male prostitution"" as a cause for law enforcement concern.\nEven if the court did not accept this argument, the fresh material should lead the court to conclude that the legislative purpose of Section 377A is ""uncertain or obscure"", they argued.\nCase 2: Johnson Ong Ming\nLawyers:\xa0Eugene Thuraisingam, Suang Wijaya and Johannes Hadi\xa0\nTHE SCIENTIFIC ARGUMENT\nThe arguments for Mr Ong\'s case were based on expert evidence on the nature of sexual orientation, where before the court was asked only to take judicial notice of scientific facts, which required a different legal test.\nThey argued that scientific evidence shows that homosexuals, like heterosexuals, cannot wilfully change their sexual orientation or attraction, with no credible scientific evidence supporting the proposition that therapy aimed at changing sexual orientation is safe or effective.\nBoth experts for Mr Ong and the Government cited in the lawyers\' case agreed that genetic and non-social environmental factors contribute to sexual orientation, with ""little if any"" scientific evidence supporting the proposition that social environmental factors play any role in sexual orientation.\nTherefore, Section 377A violates the Constitution and is discriminatory, criminalising a person based on his ""natural, unchangeable identity and for non-harmful private acts"", argued the lawyers.\n""All that Section 377A does is to simply express the majority’s \'good old-fashioned discrimination\'\xa0against male homosexuals, who are a minority,"" said the lawyers.\xa0\n""The role of our Constitution and the Court is to protect minorities against the absurd, irrational prejudices of the majority.""\nCase 3: Dr Roy Tan\nLawyer: M Ravi\nINVESTIGATION AND ENFORCEMENT IS ""ARBITARY"", INCONSISTENT\nMr Ravi\xa0said that all gay and bisexual men are obligated under a section of the Criminal Procedure Code to report their consensual private sexual acts to the police.\nThis is ""incongruous with the so-called non-proactive enforcement of Section 377A, thus resulting in absurd and arbitrary application"" of the law which is a violation of the Constitution, he argued.\nHe said failure to report an offence under Section 377A is punishable under the law, and to retain the section would ""doubly criminalise"" gay and bisexual men, as they would commit what is considered an offence under Section 377A and not report them.\nHe claimed that the circumstances in which private sexual conduct between consenting men are investigated or prosecuted are ""vague and unpredictable"".\n""Should a report be made, the police will have an obligation to act and investigate in cases where complaints are lodged by persons in respect of offences under Section 377A,"" he said.\nHe also argued that Section 377A infringes the right to equality, life, personal liberty and expression under Singapore\'s Constitution.\nSECTION 377A SERVES A LEGITIMATE STATE INTEREST, PARLIAMENT SHOULD HANDLE ANY REPEAL: AGC\nLawyers representing the AG in the hearings were Deputy Chief Counsel of litigation, transactions and administration Hui Choon Kuen, Deputy Senior State Counsel Jeremy Yeo, executive director at the AGC Academy Denise Wong, and State Counsel Jamie Pang.\nIn their submissions numbering more than a hundred pages, the lawyers said that Section 377A\'s purpose is to send ""a certain moral signal"" by its mere existence. It\xa0advances a legitimate and reasonable state interest, reflecting an aspect of societal morality,\xa0""regardless of whether and how it is enforced"".\nThey urged the court to find Section 377A constitutional and to dismiss all three applications, calling this ""a deeply divisive socio-political issue"" that should rightfully be decided by the legislature or Parliament.\nThis is because Parliament comprises democratically elected representatives\xa0who are installed by, and directly accountable to the Singaporean people, they said.\n""Whether or not to repeal Section 377A on policy grounds is an extremely difficult issue but, with all due respect to the Judiciary, it is a problem that constitutionally belongs to the Legislature and not the Judiciary,"" said AGC\'s lawyers.\nThey said the approach in the applicants\' arguments would have ""a strong potential impact on other national policies"" including family, marriage, housing and education, if accepted.\nRepealing it would be a major change from long-held societal norms, said the lawyers, and some segments of the population deeply opposed to the repeal would have ""strong feelings about this"".\nIf Parliament enacts the changes, they can work with the Executive or Cabinet to prepare the ground for change by engaging relevant communities and their leaders.\nOn the issue of enforcement, AGC\'s lawyers said the Government’s position is that the police will not take proactive action to enforce Section 377A.\xa0\n""On his part, the Public Prosecutor will not pursue prosecution where the homosexual sex acts were conducted in private between consenting adults,"" they said.\nSection 377A does not violate the articles in the Constitution as argued by the applicants, said AGC\'s lawyers. For one, the acts it criminalises do not concern speech or expression in the sense protected in the Constitution.\nThe argument that it is absurd and arbitrary to deprive homosexuals of their sexual conduct asserts that sexual freedom is a constitutional right protected by the Constitution, said AGC\'s representatives.\n""There is, however, no unenumerated free-standing right to sexual freedom or privacy in the Constitution,"" they said. ""The legality of various forms of voluntary sexual conduct are questions of societal values and morality for Parliament to decide.""\nAGC\'S OFFICIAL STATEMENT POST-HEARING\nAfter the hearings concluded on Wednesday, AGC\xa0issued a statement\xa0saying it would leave the court to make its decision.\nIt said the AG\xa0has ""already stated that where the conduct in question was between two consenting adults in a private place, the Public Prosecutor’s position is that, absent other factors, prosecution under Section 377A would not be in the public interest"".\xa0\n""It would naturally follow from this position that any prosecution under other provisions which would contradict the non-prosecution position of Section 377A would likewise not be in the public interest.""\nA judgment will be released at a later date. According to lawyers, this could take up to several\xa0months.\n', 'related_topics': ['     law ']}"

It was his son\'s first day of work.\nHe was driving from their home in Hougang\xa0along the Central Expressway (CTE) towards the AYE.\xa0After he passed the Braddell Road exit, Lim\'s son asked why he did not exit the CTE to avoid Electronic Road Pricing charges.\n""Do not be afraid, I know the way,"" Lim replied.\nHowever, Lim then continued onto the AYE, increasing his speed to about 100kmh.\nDespite various requests from his son to exit the expressway Lim refused, saying that his son did not trust him.\n""He did not take the subsequent 14 exits on the AYE, and reached the end of the AYE at Tuas Checkpoint after travelling approximately 23km on the AYE,"" said the judgment.\xa0\n""By this point, he had far exceeded his intended destination.""\nHe then drove into the motorcycle lane at Tuas Checkpoint, only stopping when the lane became too narrow for his car.\nHe then ""carefully made a three-point turn"" and began driving back against the flow of traffic, with oncoming motorcycles having to stop upon seeing his car, said the judgment.\nEventually, he merged back into the car lane but continued to drive against the flow of traffic, through the Tuas Checkpoint Departure Viaduct and back onto the AYE.\xa0\nAt this point, he was driving on lane one, and approached a vehicle driven by Tan Han Boon.\nTan swerved to avoid Lim\'s car but in doing so collided with a bus on the next lane. His car spun across the front of the bus and hit a concrete wall.\nLim\'s car then collided head-on with another car on lane one, causing it to veer from lane one to lane three, tilt to a vertical position and slam against a concrete wall.\nThe driver of the Toyota Vios, actor\xa0Jackie Liong Kuo Hwa, was pronounced dead on the scene, while his wife suffered multiple fractures and had to have surgery.\nAfter that collision, Lim\'s car veered onto lane three and collided head-on with a motor scooter. The force of the impact caused the rider, Teh Tze Yong, and his wife Choo Yat Chiam (who was riding pillion) to be flung from the scooter.\nLim\'s car continued veering until it finally collided with a concrete wall and came to a halt.\nMr Teh and Ms Choo both suffered multiple fractures and had to have surgery, while Mr Tan suffered abrasions.\nSUFFERING FROM ACUTE PSYCHOSIS\nAt the time of the offence, Lim was suffering from acute psychosis which significantly impaired his judgment, said the judgment citing reports by Dr Jerome Goh, Senior Consultant and Chief of the Department of General and Forensic Psychiatry at the Institute of Mental Health, who examined Lim.\nThe day before the incident, Lim had reported he felt his willpower was being ""controlled by God"", and that he had been hearing voices.\nOn the day of the incident, Lim said he felt he was ""not allowed"" to turn off at the exit closes to his son\'s workplace.\nHe told his son that ""God today won\'t let you go to work"".\nWhen his son asked where they were going after missing the Bukit Merah exit closest to his son\'s workplace, Lim said he did not know where God wanted to take them, Judge Hoong noted in his judgment.\nHowever, Lim was not of unsound mind and he was aware of the ""nature and quality of his actions"", including his act of driving against the flow of traffic, said the judicial commissioner.\nJudge Hoong added that although the eventual sentence might appear harsh, he also highlighted the loss of life and ""multitude of serious injuries"" caused by the incident.\n""My evaluation of the applicable principles has led me to conclude that it is the most appropriate sentence having regard to the overall circumstances of this difficult and most unfortunate case,"" he said.\n""Amidst the multitude of serious injuries caused, a human life has also been lost.""\n', 'related_topics': ['     crime ', '     transport ', '     law ']}"

      Greater diversity in pathways to Singapore Bar among new ideas for legal education system: Chief Justice
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: More diverse pathways to admission to the Singapore Bar and a review of how law students are currently trained are part of a suggested ""timely"" reimagining of Singapore\'s legal education system, the Chief Justice said in a speech on Monday (Jan 6).\nSpeaking at the Opening of the Legal Year 2020, Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon shared these\xa0views, which were gleaned\xa0after months of discussions last year with various sectors of the legal community across 16 focus groups comprising 160 people.\n""It may be valuable to introduce greater diversity in the pathways that lead to admission to the Singapore Bar,"" said the Chief Justice.\nThis will encourage those with backgrounds in fields like computer science or STEM-related fields - in Science, Technology, Engineering or Mathematics - to join the legal sector.\nThis also means that professional training courses and qualifying examinations may need to be reviewed to ensure they are able to equip all new lawyers with the necessary skills.\nSharing some possible ways to achieve this, while stressing that they are merely ideas at this point and have to be tested for viability, CJ Menon said Singapore\'s law schools could consider offering a wider variety of pathways to the Bar through their courses and degrees.\n""Apart from direct entry through undergraduate law degrees, these pathways might also permit mid-career individuals with non-law backgrounds to enter the profession,"" he said.\nOne suggestion\xa0is a new four-year degree programme, with both academic and practical components, comprising two years of core legal education, a year of professional training, and a final year of study in a complementary discipline such as business, accounting or computer science.\nTo ensure that all new entrants meet required standards, they could sit for a common Bar examination.\nREVIEW UNDERGRAD LAW SYLLABUS\xa0\nStakeholders in the discussions also widely supported the idea that it is timely to review the undergraduate law syllabus, to focus on growing areas like\xa0cross-border insolvency, international arbitration, e-commerce and financial services.\nOther suggestions include offering students\xa0working experience in more diverse institutions and organisations, and enhancing the teaching of practical skills.\nOne strategy suggested to achieve the ideas raised in the talks is to create a steering forum to guide the reimagining of\xa0legal education and training, in consultation with the universities, the Ministries of Law and Education and the judiciary.\nThe initial ideas have been discussed with the deans of Singapore\'s law schools, as well as with the Ministers of Law and Education, said CJ Menon, with further exploration expected in the year ahead.\nWhile no concrete date was given for any of the suggested initiatives, those in the legal industry told CNA they welcome the move.\nMOVE WELCOMED BY INSIDERS\nProfessor Simon Chesterman, dean of the National University of Singapore Faculty of Law, said he was ""excited about the challenges and opportunities ahead"".\n""Upheavals in the practice of law require a radical rethink of the purpose, content, method, and funding of legal education and training,"" he said.\nHe cited recent initiatives to this end by NUS Law, including the launch in December of the Centre for Technology, Robotics, AI & the Law (TRAIL), a research unit exploring the relationship between technology and legal research.\nWhile career opportunities for NUS Law graduates ""remain very strong, with high employment and salaries"", there is no room for complacency, said the dean.\nLawyer Josephus Tan of Invictus Law agreed that it is timely to reshape existing legal education to include areas like technology ethics, FinTech regulations and digital payment laws.\nOther than introducing a topical curriculum, compulsory work attachment stints to non-law sectors could be considered, to help law students have better insights into how laws function in non-court settings, he said.\nThe need to reimagine legal education ""is not perhaps surprising"", said Singapore Management University law don Eugene Tan.\n""There appear to be concerns that Singapore’s legal sector may not be equal to the task of lawyering for the domestic, regional, and international markets,"" he opined. ""It boils down to the fundamental issue of whether our legal sector will be relevant and be at the cutting edge.""\n""MORE LEGAL INNOVATORS""\nHe said Singapore needs ""more legal innovators who can craft creative solutions to multi-faceted challenges, especially with IT and Artificial Intelligence disruption transforming all aspects of human endeavour"".\n""Legal education today is fit for our present needs but may be inadequate for future challenges,"" he said, adding that the country could do with a more diverse group of law students, thinkers\xa0and practitioners.\nAssociate Professor Tan said most of Singapore\'s lawyers come from a similar background, going through the route of A Levels or International Baccalaureate.\nHowever, applicants should include non-traditional backgrounds such as polytechnics and ITE\xa0and also those who already have\xa0undergraduate degrees in other disciplines, he said.\xa0\n""The aptitude for law should not be seen as only the preserve of those who decided at 18 years of age that they would like to read law,"" said Assoc Prof Tan, explaining his view that law should be a graduate degree.\nHaving lawyers from more diverse educational backgrounds would enable them to better appreciate an issue not just from the legal perspective, and to offer more rounded solutions, he opined.\n""Law cannot be a mono-discipline; it needs to embrace other disciplines,"" said Assoc Prof Tan. ""The more varied the practitioners and teachers of law are, the better law and the legal professions can meet the demands and expectations and engage in innovative problem-solving.""\nLaw Society president Gregory Vijayendran told CNA ""we can do better"" as a community to reduce ""the steep learning curve for law undergrads to acquire practice-oriented skills"", while the Ministry of Law said it has held detailed discussions with more than 300 lawyers on the future of legal services.\nEducation Minister Ong Ye Kung said in a Facebook post that the Ministry of Education shares the Chief Justice\'s views that undergraduate courses must have more diverse curriculum elements, and more pathways for entry into the profession.\n', 'related_topics': ['     law ', '     education ']}"

      Commentary: Litigation - the real reason financial reports are becoming harder to read
  </h1>, 'text': 'SYDNEY: Westpac saw a bumper turnout of shareholders at its annual general meeting in Sydney in December 2019.\xa0\nMany of them were angry at the Australian bank’s alleged role in facilitating child exploitation in the Philippines, its 23 million alleged breaches of anti-money-laundering laws, and its initial ritualistic response to the allegations.\nThis included donating A$18 million (US$12.5 million) to an anti-sexual exploitation charity, followed by the departure of its chief executive and the foreshadowed departure of its chairman later in 2019.\nSome of those shareholders were probably clutching onto the bank’s 154-page financial statement. They would have needed to understand it to ask questions about Westpac’s financial performance.\nBack at the start of the 2000s, Westpac’s financial statement was only 35 pages long.\nMuch of what’s been added to statements such as Westpac’s has been in response to the threat of litigation. Companies that make false or misleading disclosures risk class actions. It’s safer to include more rather than less, even if it makes the resulting document hard to navigate.\nAustralia has just had its first class action judgement, after earlier cases that had been settled out of court. The United States has had many.\nMy own research with colleagues in the United States finds that caution in the face of the threat of litigation has made financial reports increasingly less readable over time.\nHOW MIGHT LITIGATION MAKE REPORTS HARDER TO READ?\nFirms can be sued for making misleading disclosures. This happens most often where shareholders allege that the firm failed to disclose all relevant information, or where it has failed to meet projections.\nAfter such class actions, firms can face increasing difficulties with customers, suppliers and lenders, being seen as less credible. Managers face pay cuts and termination.\nOne way to ward off such class actions is to make disclosures more detailed.\nIncreasing detail enables firms to add caveats, footnotes and nuance, conveying uncertainty – the consequence of which is that their reports are less clear.\nHOW WE TEASED OUT THE LINK\nMy coauthors and I examined 96,000 US annual reports issued from 1993 to 2013.\nWe also collected data on class actions in relation to reports for those years.\nOne of the best readability metrics is the so-called fog index, which measures the number of syllables per word and words per sentence in order to provide a measure of the number of years of education needed to read a statement.\n\xa0It says this article needs the best part of 15 years.\nWe also used other indexes including the so-called bog index which scores documents on word choice and sentence structure.\nWe captured firms’ tendency to avoid declarative statements by calculating the proportion of words that were “uncertain”, and measured their tendency to address specific legal threats by calculating the proportion of words that were legal in nature, both of which were subjective exercises.\nWHAT WE FOUND\nWe found litigation risk encouraged firms to take steps that reduced the readability of their financial reports.\nAfter firms had experienced a class action, their readability metrics worsened significantly. This was even the case several years after that class action, suggesting a long-lasting change.\nIf a chief executive had experienced a class action at one job, their reports were likely to be less readable in subsequent jobs, strongly suggesting that litigation drove hard to read reports rather than the other way round.\nWe\xa0found that litigation experience increased the size and volume of firms’ disclosures. While worsening readability, this at least had the virtue of increasing thoroughness.\nLitigation experience was\xa0also associated with using more complex words and more words per sentence. This implies firms add more detail and nuance to their disclosures, potentially increasing their accuracy.\nAfter litigation, firms used more uncertain words in their reports. This suggests they avoid declaratory statements in an attempt to better reflect the risk and uncertainty associated with projections.\nFirms also use more legalistic terms following litigation. This implies they attempt to preempt legal action by specifically addressing potential legal issues.\nThe Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) has expressed concern over what it calls “sludge” in reports that covers bases but leaves readers uninformed.\nIt says over-reliance on disclosure “in some ways proved an enabler” of the poor conduct revealed by the banking royal commission.\nOur work and the work of ASIC suggests much needs to happen to make reports both accurate and readable.\nMark Humphery-Jenner is an Associate Professor of Finance at the University of New South Wales.

He has therefore contrived excuses for running away,"" said AGC.\nMr Li, the nephew of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, said in a Facebook post on Wednesday he would not ""dignify the AGC\'s conduct"" by participating in the court case.\nMr Li\'s case has been ongoing without him being\xa0in Singapore, with lawyer Abraham Vergis leading his defence.\xa0\nIt began with a Facebook post in 2017, when\xa0Mr Li published a private Facebook post with a link to a New York Times editorial titled Censored in Singapore, and a description saying: “Keep in mind, of course, that the Singapore government is very litigious and has a pliant court system”.\nThis post received ""wide publicity"", said AGC.\n""He must have known this would happen, given his status as Mr Lee Kuan Yew\'s grandson, his inflammatory statement and the timing of his post,"" it added.\nHe was asked if he would apologise and withdraw the statement after AGC came to know of the post. It said it made clear to Mr Li that no proceedings would be brought against him if he did as requested.\n""But he\xa0refused to withdraw his statement, or apologise,"" AGC said.\n""Mr Li’s conduct suggests a sense that he is above the law. That is apparent from his consistent complaint that these proceedings should not have been brought against him at all.""\nIt added that the need to take action against people who make ""baseless, contemptuous statements against the Singapore judiciary has long been made clear, from the days of Singapore’s founding Prime Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew"".\nIt pointed out other contempt proceedings it had initiated against people who made similar contemptuous statements against the judiciary.\nThese include a 2010 case where a British author and former journalist Alan Shadrake was found to be in contempt by referring to the ""absence of independence in a compliant judiciary"".\nAGC RESPONDS TO\xa0ALLEGATIONS OF ""UNUSUAL CONDUCT""\nAGC also responded on Thursday to Mr Li\'s allegations in\xa0his Facebook post that it\xa0had applied to strike out and seal parts of his defence affidavit, and that this was part of ""a broader pattern of unusual conduct by the AGC"".\nIn response to Mr Li\'s statement that parts of his defence affidavit were struck out by the court, AGC said this was because his affidavit ""contained matters that were scandalous and irrelevant to the issues in the case"".\nIt said such\xa0striking out applications are regularly made and provided for in the Rules of Court. The High Court had struck out several parts of the affidavit after hearing full arguments, including from Mr Li\'s lawyer.\nMr Li did not appeal when told to refile his defence affidavit to comply with the court\'s order, pointed out AGC.\nAs for Mr Li\'s complaint\xa0about having papers served on\xa0him out\xa0of Singapore, AGC said the court had confirmed in April 2019 that he had been validly served. This was after full arguments, including those from Mr Li\'s lawyer.\n""Now, more than nine months later, he rehashes the same complaint,"" said AGC.

This is in reality a demand that he be treated differently from all others.""\nAGC said it had applied to cross-examine Mr Li on his defence affidavit and for him to answer questions on oath about his post.\n""Such cross-examination will bring out the truth as to what actually happened, and Mr Li’s intentions in making the post,"" said AGC.\n""The questions he was asked included how many Facebook friends he had at the time of his post and whether they included members of the media.\xa0\n""This is relevant to the question of whether Mr Li would reasonably have foreseen his post to be published by the media. Mr Li refused to answer these questions. The clear inference is that his answers would have been damaging to his case.""\nAGC added that Mr Li had stated from as early as August 2017 that he would not be returning to Singapore for the proceedings.\n""It is therefore clear that he never intended to come back to Singapore to defend himself, but was using legal representation in the proceedings as a platform to launch baseless allegations against the AGC and others. That strategy failed,"" said AGC.\nThe case came amid a wider public feud among the children of former\xa0Prime Minister\xa0Lee Kuan Yew, which has pitted Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong against his siblings\xa0Lee Hsien Yang and Lee Wei Ling. Mr Lee Hsien Yang is Mr Li\'s father.\nCASE CAN PROCEED\xa0WITHOUT MR LI IN SINGAPORE: LAWYERS\nLawyers told CNA that the case can proceed even\xa0if Mr Li does not return to Singapore for the hearings.\n""But only the Attorney-General will submit documents and attend court to argue the case,"" said lawyer Suang Wijaya, a partner at Eugene Thuraisingam LLP.\nHe explained that contempt of court is\xa0""quasi-criminal"", in that proceedings\xa0are governed by civil procedure rules rather than criminal ones, but could result in imprisonment or a fine.\n""Any litigant may refuse to participate in proceedings, for instance, by not submitting documents, not making any arguments, and not attending court hearings whether in person or with legal representation,"" said Mr Wijaya.\nLawyer Darren Tan, a director at Invictus Law, said Mr Li could discharge his lawyers and elect to act in person, but not take any further step in proceedings.\nHe said Mr Li could stay overseas as long as he does not return to Singapore.\n""It is highly unlikely that Mr Li will ever be extradited to Singapore to face any penal sanction,"" he opined.\nWARRANT OF ARREST COULD BE ISSUED\nShould Mr Li not\xa0participate in the case, an order of committal for contempt of court may be obtained against him, said Mr Tan.\nThis means the AGC succeeds in obtaining a court order stating that Mr Li is found to be in contempt, and a fine or jail term may be imposed.\n""But practically nothing will happen if he doesn\'t set foot in Singapore,"" said Mr Tan.\xa0\nLawyer Amarjit Singh Sidhu, owner of Amarjit Sidhu Law, said that if Mr Li stays overseas and is found to be in contempt, ""there may be a warrant of arrest issued"".\n""When and if he returns to Singapore, he can be placed under arrest,"" he said.\nOn the flipside, if Mr Li is found not guilty of contempt, the court has the power to acquit him even without his participation, said Mr Wijaya.\n""The court is not entitled to issue a guilty verdict just because he had refused to participate in the proceedings,"" he explained. \xa0\n""The court must still consider whether, on the evidence and the arguments presented by the Attorney-General, Li\'s 2017 Facebook post was (in) contempt.""\nCNA has contacted Mr Vergis for comment.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Li Shengwu ', '     law ', '     AGC ']}"

      Judge dismisses The Online Citizen's POFMA challenge 
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: A High Court judge on Wednesday (Feb 19) dismissed an appeal by The Online Citizen (TOC) against a correction direction under the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA).\nThe alternative news site had been issued the direction by Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam for an article where a Malaysian human rights group alleged ""brutal, unlawful"" executions in Changi Prison.\nThe article, ""M\'sian human rights group alleges \'brutal, unlawful\' state execution process in Changi Prison"", was published on Jan 16 this year.\nIt described allegations of brutal hanging procedures, including the kicking of a prisoner\'s neck ""with great force in order to break it"".\nThe Ministry of Home Affairs refuted the allegations as ""untrue, baseless and preposterous"", and said any acts as those described would have been thoroughly investigated and dealt with.\nIn her judgment, Justice Belinda Ang noted how TOC contended that the subject statement is not a ""statement of fact"" because it is ""neither a fact nor an opinion but rather a report on hearsay"".\xa0\n""In TOC\'s view, it has never affirmed that the subject statement contained statements of facts or that the events described in the subject statement took place in fact,"" said Justice Ang, adding that TOC argues it ""merely reported in an even-handed way that LFL (Lawyers for Liberty) had made certain allegations"".\xa0\nTOC editor Terry Xu had said in his affidavit that the news site was ""simply reporting the fact that the allegations ... were made by LFL"" and that he was ""not responsible for making the statements"".\xa0\nJustice Ang said she was ""unable to accept"" this argument, adding that TOC\'s ""reporting defence""\xa0was ""untenable"".\xa0\nThis defence is ""premised on a misconstruction"", said Justice Ang.\nWhile it is true that LFL did make a press statement, this is ""inconsequential"", she said, because the relevant inquiry is whether the statement identified by the correction direction - the details of the alleged hanging procedures - is true, and not whether TOC\'s report that LFL made a press statement is true.\nIn addition, the fact that TOC does not know whether the subject statement is true is ""ultimately an immaterial consideration""\xa0as under POFMA the issuance of such a correction direction does not require a fault element, said Justice Ang.\n""Section 11(4) states that \'[a] person who communicated a false statement of fact in Singapore may be issued correction direction even if the person does not know or has no reason to believe that the statement is false”,\xa0she said.\xa0\n""A minister is therefore not prevented from issuing a Part 3 CD (correction direction), even if a person genuinely believes that he communicates a true statement of fact when the statement is in fact false.""\nTOC NOT ENTITLED TO CREATE ANOTHER CATEGORY OF STATEMENTS: JUDGE\nThe judge also rejected TOC\'s argument that the statement was neither a fact nor an opinion, but a ""report based on hearsay"".\xa0\nMr Xu wrote in his written submissions that a reasonable reader would recognise that the article was reporting on hearsay.\nHe said the words ""allege"" and\xa0""allegation"" were used six times in the article, ensuring that readers were aware that they were unverified allegations.\xa0\nThe article also concluded with a sentence stating that TOC had contacted MHA for comments, apparently signalling to readers that TOC was trying to verify the allegations with the ministry.\nIn doing so, TOC has ""mistakenly"" assumed it can introduce a different category of statement, said Justice Ang.\nThere are only two recognised categories of statements for the purposes of this POFMA section - ""facts"" and ""opinions"", she said, and TOC was not entitled to create a third category of statements.\nTOC also wrongly assumes that a statement can only be regarded as a fact after a fact-checking exercise, said the judge. However such an exercise is only relevant for determining whether a fact is true or false\xa0and not whether a statement is a fact or an opinion.\nApplying the ""reasonable person"" test, the judge found that a ""reasonable person"" who reads the subject statement would regard it as being a statement of fact.\nWHO SHOULD BEAR THE ""BURDEN OF PROOF""?\nTOC relied on a particular sub-section of POFMA,\xa0section 17(5)(b),\xa0as its sole ground to set aside the correction direction. The sub-section states that a correction direction can be set aside if the subject statement is not a statement of fact or if it is a true statement of fact.\xa0\nA significant feature\xa0of this section requires TOC to prove the truth of a statement rather than have the respondent prove its falsehood, said Justice Ang.\nBoth sides, TOC and the Attorney-General, have argued ""at length"" in their written submissions about who should bear the burden of proof, said the judge.\xa0\nIn its arguments, TOC relies on a previous decision made in Singapore\'s first POFMA challenge by the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP).\xa0SDP\'s challenge was dismissed, but the judge in that case held that the onus of proof in a setting aside application under s 17(5) falls on the respondent.\nJustice Ang said her views are ""quite different"" from the judge in the SDP case\xa0and that the legal burden of proof actually rests on the statement-maker - in this case, TOC.\nIn any case, even if the onus was on the respondent (in this case, the Attorney-General) to prove that a factual statement is false, the outcome of TOC\'s case would have remained the same, she said.\nThis is because TOC did not\xa0in the first place argue that the statement in the correction direction is true, she said.\n', 'related_topics': ['     The Online Citizen ', '     POFMA ', '     law ']}"

      Lee Kuan Yew knew what he wanted in will, Lee Suet Fern not acting as his lawyer: Defence in legal misconduct case
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Lee Suet Fern was not acting as a lawyer in the preparation of Lee Kuan Yew’s final will, and Mr Lee knew what he wanted, which was to revert to a previous will distributing equal shares of his estate to his children.\nThis\xa0was key to the\xa0arguments put forward by Mrs Lee’s lawyers in her defence at a disciplinary tribunal. Her legal team included\xa0former Attorney-General and Senior Counsel Walter Woon, Senior Counsel Kenneth Tan and a team from Providence Law led by Abraham Vergis.\nMrs Lee, who has been a lawyer for 37 years,\xa0was found guilty by the disciplinary tribunal of grossly improper misconduct in her handling of the late Mr Lee’s last will, in findings released last week.\nThe tribunal ruled that she had failed to advance the interests of Mr Lee, who was her client in the preparation and execution of his final will dated December 2013, and that she failed to advise him to be independently advised.\nThis was against the backdrop of a situation where Mrs Lee had conflicts of interest, as her husband stood to gain from the will, the tribunal said.\nInstead of acting in conflict of interest and in breach of the legal profession, Mrs Lee, the wife of the late founding prime minister’s younger son Lee Hsien Yang, was ""merely assisting in a family matter at the request of her husband"", argued the defence.\nThe late Mr Lee ""knew exactly what he wanted"", to revert to a will he made in 2011 and bequeath equal shares in his estate to his three children: Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, Mr Lee Hsien Yang and Dr Lee Wei Ling.\nThe December 2013 will differed from the one before it as it dictated that Mr Lee’s estate would be shared equally among his three children. The will before gave his daughter Dr Lee Wei Ling an extra share.\nThe will before also did not have any clause on the demolition of the Oxley family home, and said that Dr Lee’s right to stay there was subject to Lee Hsien Loong’s consent, but the December 2013 will gave Dr Lee unfettered right to stay at the Oxley home.\nMrs Lee’s lawyers asserted in written submissions that the Law Society (LawSoc) had not proven\xa0its charges against her.\nLAW SOCIETY GAVE NO EVIDENCE THAT LEE KUAN YEW WAS LEE SUET FERN\'S CLIENT: DEFENCE\n“Beyond mere assertion, the Law Society has presented no evidence that Mr Lee Kuan Yew was (Mrs Lee’s) client and that she prepared the December 2013 will,” said the lawyers.\nThey said it was a clear and reasonable inference from “undisputed facts” that Mrs Lee was neither the late Mr Lee’s solicitor, and nor did she prepare the will in question.\nInstead, they argued that Mr Lee was discussing his last will with Ms Kwa Kim\xa0Li, who had prepared his wills before this.\n“He had decided to revert to the equal division of his estate made in the original 2011 will long before (Mrs Lee) was pulled in,” said the lawyers.\nThey said Ms Kwa was advising Mr Lee on the terms of his will and was informed before and after the December 2013 will was executed.\nWhen Mr Lee could not contact Ms Kwa, he told his son Hsien Yang to get it done, knowing that Mrs Lee was his wife.\nThey said that LawSoc\'s case that Mrs Lee and her husband deliberately cut Ms Kwa out of the process and got Mr Lee Kuan Yew to execute his last will in her absence was ""implausible"".\nMR LEE KNEW WHAT HE WAS DOING\n""The alternative which the Law Society is putting forward is that Mr Lee Kuan Yew, a very brilliant lawyer and world statesman, did not understand his own will despite reading it several times,"" argued the lawyers.\n“All that (Mrs Lee) did was to forward what she thought was the original 2011 will to Mr Lee Kuan Yew and to Ms Kwa for engrossment,” said the lawyers.\n“It was Mr Lee Kuan Yew who decided not to wait for Ms Kwa. Significantly, he gave instructions to have the will engrossed and stated that he would sign it \'before a solicitor in Fern’s office or from any other office\',"" they wrote.\n""Mr Lee was content to execute the will before any solicitor. It is clear from this that (Mrs Lee\'s) role was peripheral. She only got pulled in because it was convenient.""\nThey added that Ms Kwa did not object to the last will, and had 15 months to alert Mr Lee to any issue with it before he died.\nThe lawyers also pointed out that while Ms Kwa was in LawSoc\'s list of witnesses, they did not call her in the end.\nNO PLAUSIBLE MOTIVE: DEFENCE\nThey added that reverting to equal shares would have reduced Lee Hsien Yang\'s share instead of increasing it, and said LawSoc had not suggested any plausible motive for Mrs Lee to change the will.\nHowever, the disciplinary tribunal ruled in favour of LawSoc,\xa0which was represented by Senior Counsel Tan Chee Meng and lawyers Koh Swee Yen and Eugene Oh.\nWith the guilty finding, the case has been referred to the Court of Three Judges, which will hear the matter at a later date.\xa0\nThe highest disciplinary body for misconduct by lawyers could fine Mrs Lee, suspend her or disbar her.\n', 'related_topics': ['     law ', '     Lee Kuan Yew ', '     Oxley Road ', '     Lee Hsien Yang ']}"

      Why the Attorney-General can be both a public prosecutor and Government legal advisor: Edwin Tong explains
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The Attorney-General does not hold political office and has independent prosecutorial discretion that is protected by the Constitution, Senior Minister State for Law Edwin Tong said in Parliament on Friday (Feb 28).\nThe appointment is also done through a dual-key system, Mr Tong said\xa0during his Committee of Supply debate speech.\nThis is why the Attorney-General can hold the dual role of Public Prosecutor and chief legal advisor to the Government, he added.\nMr Tong was responding to a suggestion by\xa0Workers\' Party MP Sylvia Lim during the committee of supply debate that an amendment be made to the Constitution to de-couple this dual role.\nMs Lim said the Attorney-General has a\xa0responsibility to decide on criminal prosecutions on behalf of the State: ""Who should be charged, who should be let off with a warning, who should have their charges reduced and compounded, and so on.""\n""He is arguably more powerful than High Court judge, as his exercise of discretion is\xa0done in private and (cannot be appealed),"" she said.\nMs Lim suggested that the roles be split ""so the person who is public prosecutor is not the same person taking the Government\'s instructions in non-criminal matters"".\nBut in Singapore, Mr Tong said the Attorney-General does not hold a political office, further reinforcing\xa0the role\'s independence.\nThis is unlike jurisdictions such as England and Australia, he highlighted,\xa0where the Attorney-General holds a political office and is subject to “political pressure”.\nIn these jurisdictions, Mr Tong said separation of the role is necessary to ensure the independent exercise of prosecutorial discretion.\n“The Constitutional safeguards in Singapore ensure that the Attorney-General is protected from such pressure\xa0and allows him to discharge both his roles as Public Prosecutor as well as\xa0the Government’s legal advisor without fear or favour,” he added.\nMr Tong said the Constitution provides that the Attorney-General has the discretion “to institute, conduct or discontinue any proceedings for any offence”.\nAnother legal safeguard, Mr Tong said, is the dual-key system for the appointment of the Attorney-General.\nBoth the President and the Prime Minister must agree to the appointment, with Mr Tong stating that the Presidential veto makes a more robust system compared to other major common law\xa0jurisdictions like England and Wales, Australia, and New Zealand.\nIn these jurisdictions, Mr Tong said officers in charge of prosecutions are appointed solely by a government minister.\nMs Lim had also suggested that the public prosecutor be given security of tenure, which means he or she cannot be removed from office except in exceptional and specified circumstances, as opposed to the current system of serving for a fixed\xa0term.\nReferring to ""other mature common law jurisdictions, the officers in charge of prosecutions in England and Wales, Australia, New Zealand and Hong Kong do not have security of tenure and typically serve pre-determined renewable terms”, Mr Tong said.\nWhat’s more important, Mr Tong said, is that it is “very difficult” to remove the Attorney-General in Singapore, highlighting that the President, Prime Minister and a tribunal of three judges, including the Chief Justice, must all agree that the Attorney-General is unable to discharge his functions, or there has been\xa0“misbehaviour”.\n“In some of the other mentioned jurisdictions, the requirements for removal are considerably less stringent,” he added.\nThese safeguards must also be coupled with the Attorney-General’s actions to maintain public trust, Mr Tong said, adding that he has not shied away from prosecuting high-profile or well-connected individuals.\n“Some examples of more recent and those further back prosecutions include: Actions against a Minister of State, against\xa0sitting and former Members of Parliament, against at that time, the Singapore Civil Defence Force Commissioner, the then-National Kidney Foundation CEO, and also\xa0the then-Deputy Chief Executive of PUB,” he said.\nMr Tong also pointed to the high confidence of the public in the legal system, highlighting survey statistics referred to during the 2016 Committee of Supply debate that showed 90 per cent of respondents had trust and confidence in the Attorney-General’s Chambers.\n“The Government fully agrees that public confidence is important,” Mr Tong said. “And because of the way we have built up our institutions, public confidence in our institutions is high. Our institutions work well and have worked well.”\nMr Tong said this confidence did not develop by chance, and is the result of “prudent legal safeguards, as well as the integrity of those in the system”.\nHe said the public trusts the Attorney-General and the broader legal system because it appoints “individuals of the highest calibre and integrity, and they exercise their discretion independently”.\n“The high levels of public trust in our legal system, and the Attorney-General’s Chambers, speak for themselves,” he stated.\nHowever, Ms Lim cited a 2017 Straits Times commentary where a former Attorney-General suggested the introduction of this\xa0de-coupling, not because of current issues, but to\xa0""pre-empt future problems"".\nShe also highlighted that the writer said a constant change in Attorney-Generals affects the morale of other public prosecutors.\nIn response, Mr Tong said from a Singapore context, the Government\xa0looks at the broad institutional protections, the integrity of the individual, and the fact that there have been high-profile prosecutions.\n""We constantly review the system that we have. We understand that other countries look at the separation. We look at our system and we constantly evaluate it and we will make adjustments as appropriate,"" he added.\n""But at the end of the day, what drives the decisions that we make ultimately has to be output, performance and the way in which the public retains and reposes confidence in the functions of the Attorney-General.""\n', 'related_topics': ['     Edwin Tong ', '     law ']}"

      Contempt of court: Apex court dismisses appeals by opposition politician John Tan, activist Jolovan Wham
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The Court of Appeal on Monday (Mar 16) dismissed appeals by social activist Jolovan Wham and opposition politician John Tan against their convictions and sentences for\xa0contempt of court.\nThis means that Tan, who was re-elected into the Singapore Democratic Party\'s (SDP) Central Executive Committee last October, cannot contest the next General Election.\nAnyone who is fined at least S$2,000 or jailed a year or more for an offence would be disqualified from running for election as a member of parliament for five years, under Singapore\'s Constitution.\nWham and Tan were each fined S$5,000 in April last year over a Facebook post that Wham penned and Tan referred to in another post on his own page.\nWham had said in his public post in April 2018 that Malaysia\'s judges ""are more independent than Singapore\'s for cases with political implications"".\nAfter the Attorney-General\'s Chambers (AGC) commenced contempt proceedings against Wham, Tan published a post saying that ""by charging Jolovan for scandalising the judiciary, the AGC only confirms what he said was true"".\nThe two men were found guilty of contempt by scandalising the court and fined, but appealed against the conviction and sentence, as well as against the order to pay the AG costs for court proceedings.\nExplaining the decision by a five-judge court consisting Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon and Judges of Appeal Andrew Phang, Judith Prakash, Tay Yong Kwang and Steven Chong, CJ Menon said there are two elements of scandalising contempt.\nFirst, that the person intentionally made a publication that impugned the integrity, propriety or impartiality of any court, and second, that this posed a risk that public confidence in the administration of justice would be undermined. It has to be proven that this publication did not amount to fair criticism.\nNOT FAIR CRITICISM\nThe court found that the defence of fair criticism did not apply for both men, as neither of their posts had an objective or rational basis.\nWham\'s post ""objectively and plainly entails a direct attack on the independence and integrity of Singapore\'s judiciary"", the court found.\n""Wham plainly intended to make that statement and to have it taken seriously. He stood by it, repeated it on several occasions and declined to retract or apologise for it,"" said CJ Menon.\nDefence lawyer Eugene Thuraisingam, who represented both men, argued that Tan\'s sentence was manifestly excessive.\nHe said that Tan had taken down his post after the sentencing, and that anyone reading his post would form the view that he was merely ""lashing out in anger"".\nThey would opine that Tan had been upset with the AG for taking Wham to court, and not that Tan had been acting with the primary intention of undermining the judiciary.\nMr Thuraisingam also pointed out that a fine of S$2,000 or more would disqualify Tan from contesting the upcoming General Election.\nHe argued that Tan was willing to accept a harsher sentence of several days\' jail rather than bear a fine, since the jail term was under a year and would not disqualify him from taking part in elections.\nThe report by the Electoral Boundaries Review Committee\xa0was released on Mar 13,\xa0a sign that elections could be called soon.\xa0\nTan had stood as a candidate in Marsiling-Yew Tee\xa0GRC with an SDP team\xa0in the 2015 General Election.\nON DISQUALIFICATION FOR ELECTIONS\nThe court rejected the arguments against the fine and found that there were no precedent cases where a sentence was changed from a fine to jail after taking into account the offender\'s desire to run for electoral office.\nCJ Menon said that Tan\'s potential disqualification from standing in the next General Election was not a relevant factor in sentencing.\nThe court found that the judiciary and the administration of justice would be brought into disrepute ""if we were to impose sentences with an eye towards the political process"".\n""After all, a court that chooses to impose an inappropriate sentence in order to avoid disqualifying a candidate from standing for election as a Member of Parliament could just as easily do the same thing to achieve the opposite end,"" said the chief justice. ""In truth, both outcomes are equally abhorrent and impermissible.""\nThe court also dismissed an appeal by the AG for an order to be given to both men for a mandated apology, but granted its appeal for an injunction to be given to Wham to cease publication, as his offending post was still up. Tan had removed his post.\nThe court ordered both men and the AG to file submissions on costs.\nIn response to CNA\'s queries, the SDP said that it was ""disappointed"" with the outcome of the appeal.\xa0\nTan will continue to play a crucial role in the party\'s electoral campaign, said Surayah Akbar, an SDP spokesperson.\n""He remains an integral part of SDP family and his commitment and passion to bring democracy to our nation remains undiminished,"" Ms Akbar said.\n', 'related_topics': ['     opposition ', '     SDP ', '     law ']}"

It cannot be said to be redundant simply because of its non-enforcement,\xa0he added.\nAccording to Section 377A of the Penal Code, any man who commits any act of gross indecency with another man in public or in private can be jailed for up to two years. This extends to any man who abets such an act, procures or attempts to procure such an act.\nThe verdict was delivered in chambers, four months after arguments were made by the lawyers for the three men: Disc jockey Johnson Ong Ming, retired general practitioner Roy Tan Seng Kee and Bryan Choong Chee Hoong, the former executive director of LGBT non-profit organisation Oogachaga.\nMr Choong said in a statement that he is ""of course disappointed"", but said his eyes ""are\xa0firmly on the road ahead"".\xa0\n""I’ll be studying this judgment closely with my lawyers.

The regulations came into force last Friday.\n""We are aware that certain provisions in written law and certain legal instruments (such as a company’s constitution) provide for personal attendance at meetings,"" said the law and finance ministries in Tuesday\'s release.\xa0\n""The Government has received feedback that businesses are uncertain about how to comply with both those provisions and the regulations.""\nAs such, the Government will introduce new legislation at the next Parliamentary sitting to provide ""legal certainty"" on this issue.\nThe proposed provisions will allow for alternative arrangements to be made for\xa0when personal attendance at a meeting is provided for ""in any written law or legal instrument"".\nExample of such meetings include those under the Companies Act and company constitutions (for example annual general meetings), meetings held under trust deeds, creditor\'s meetings and meetings held under the trade union\'s rules.\nUnder the proposed provisions, meetings held on or after Mar 27 in accordance with alternative arrangements will be deemed to have satisfied the relevant legal requirements.\nIf passed, the provisions would be brought into force ""as soon as possible"", according to the release.\nIn the meantime, those planning to conduct meetings and who are not sure about how to comply with current safe-distancing measures should approach their regulators for advice.\nUPDATED GUIDANCE FOR SHAREHOLDER MEETINGS: MAS, ACRA, SGX REGCO\nFollowing the ministries\' announcement, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) and Singapore Exchange Regulation (SGX RegCo) issued updated guidelines for conducting general meetings.\nAs announced previously, issuers can choose to defer annual general meetings to after Apr 30 if specified criteria are met, said the three bodies.\nFor issuers who choose to proceed with meetings before this date, the bodies set out updated guidelines on how these should be held.\nMeetings held before this date should meet specific criteria, including letting shareholders ask questions, having the meeting shown by ""live"" webcast and allowing for proxy voting.\nIssuers should invite shareholders to submit questions in advance, and then ""publicly address"" substantial queries via their website, webcast and on SGXNet.\nAny quorum requirements will be satisfied through the attendance of the minimum number of shareholders specified in the issuer’s constitution,\xa0or up to the number of individuals permitted under the regulations, whichever is lower, said the release.\nOther arrangements could include organising virtual information sessions before meetings start as well as at the close of proxy voting, to let shareholders engage with management.\nIn terms of proxy voting, shareholders must appoint the chairperson of the general meeting to act as proxy and direct the vote at the general meeting, said the release.\xa0\nIssuers are also strongly encouraged to provide at least 21 days’ notice to shareholders on the general meetings, to allow shareholders to consider the matters, pose questions and vote via proxy.\nIssuers must also publish minutes from the meeting on their websites.\n""Issuers’ disclosures are crucial to shareholders’ decision-making,"" said the release.

      All three men to appeal dismissal of their challenges against Section 377A

This extends to any man who abets such an act, procures or attempts to procure such an act.\nDr Tan\'s lawyer, M Ravi, has already filed a notice to appeal, in documents seen by CNA.\nDr Tan told CNA that he is disappointed that the High Court ""has seen it fit to uphold the constitutionality of Section 377A, an unjust, archaic, colonial-era law which has no place in a modern, developed nation like Singapore"".\xa0\nHe said the statute ""discriminates against a significant demographic that contributes in no small measure to the country\'s economy, especially in the creative industries, and effectively renders them second-class citizens"".\xa0\n""The government has pledged not to enforce 377A but this unsatisfactory compromise is not only legally unsound but is also at odds with several important sections of the Criminal Procedure Code,"" he said.\nDr Tan said the existence of Section 377A ""has manifold ramifications that adversely affect the lives of gay men in numerous areas such as positive media representation, censorship, workplace and housing discrimination, bullying in schools and recognition of their relationships"".\nHe also referred to how several key figures such as former Chief Justice Chan Sek Keong, former Attorney-Generals Walter Woon and V K Rajah, Deputy Attorney-General Hri Kumar Nair and former law professor and ambassador Tommy Koh have called into question the constitutionality of Section 377A.\n""Therefore, I feel that the High Court ruling is at odds with their expert legal opinion and merits re-examination,"" said Dr Tan.\nDJ Johnson Ong Ming, whose challenge was heard jointly with Dr Tan, told CNA that the decision was ""disappointing, but not entirely surprising, as Justice See mostly felt that he was bound by the decision of the Court of Appeal in 2014"".\nMr Ong added that he has decided to appeal as ""it will give the Court of Appeal an opportunity to reverse its decision and to overturn this bad law"".\xa0\n""The fact remains that 377A continues to inflict harm on LGBTQ Singaporeans every day that it remains in force,"" he said.\nThe third man who mounted a challenge, Bryan Choong Chee Hoong, said he was disappointed but was keeping his eyes ""firmly on the road ahead"".\nHis lawyer Remy Choo said they would be filing the appeal individually, but that it is likely to be heard jointly again.\nIn a statement after Monday\'s outcome, non-profit LGBTQ movement Pink Dot said it was disappointed that the constitutional challenges had been dismissed, ""despite significant progress in the acceptance of LGBTQ people"".\n', 'related_topics': ['     law ']}"

      Legislative action may be taken to make sure landlords pass on rebates to tenants, says DPM Heng
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The Government is prepared to take legislative action when necessary to ensure that the property tax rebates granted to commercial landlords are passed on to their tenants during the COVID-19 outbreak, said Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat on Wednesday (Apr 1).\n“I want to urge the landlords to not only pass on these rebates but to take care of the tenants,” he said, reiterating a point that he and other ministers have made in recent months.\nAdding that there is a “long-term relationship"" between both parties, he said:\xa0“It’s important that tenants which are viable should be taken care of.""\nAs part of the record S$48 billion Resilience Budget announced last week, qualifying commercial properties that have been badly impacted by the coronavirus pandemic will not have to pay property tax this year.\nThis is a major step-up from the initial 15 to 30 per cent property tax rebate announced in Budget 2020 in February.\nThe expanded property tax relief will cover hotels, serviced apartments, tourist attractions, shops and restaurants.\nIn his speech last week, Mr Heng repeated his call for landlords to pass on these rebates ""fully"" by reducing rentals so as to ease the cash flow and cost pressures faced by tenants.\nHowever, many tenants have criticised landlords for dragging their feet on this.\nBusiness groups, such as the Restaurant Association of Singapore and the Singapore Retailers Association, have also in recent days called on landlords to translate these savings into lower rentals “urgently” as stricter safe distancing rules have put a further squeeze on retailers and F&B operators.\nIn response to a question from CNA on whether the Government might make it mandatory for landlords to pass on these tax rebates, Mr Heng said: “Indeed we are looking into this.”\nHe added: “Just as our package is to help viable companies to stay afloat, to make sure we protect jobs for our workers … So in the same way, we have to do this together.\n“I’ll be looking at what landlords are doing and if there’s a need for us to take legislative action, we are prepared to do that.”\nMr Heng was speaking to reporters after touring aquaculture facilities at a local farm to understand how farmers in Singapore deploy sustainable farming technologies.\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has underscored the importance of resilience, which is why the second support package dedicated resources to ramping up resilience in the Singapore economy and society, he said.\nFood resilience is a key part of this, Mr Heng added, and one way to strengthen this is to “accelerate” ongoing work on domestic production.\nNoting that Singapore has already set a target of producing 30 per cent of the country’s nutritional needs by 2030, he said: “We will need to accelerate this work and see how best we can enhance our R&D (research and development), enhance our master plan to make sure that we can bring all the different parties together.”\nThe Government will also look into how it can help resolve issues that businesses in this industry are facing, be it in land use, financing of operations and manpower, he added.\nAsked whether it is feasible to ramp up production in Singapore, Mr Heng said that this may be possible for projects that are already under way. But in newer areas, this “may take a bit more time”.\n“But we are certainly seeking to quicken the pace of our work,” he told reporters.\nOther measures to boost food resilience include ensuring that the country’s stockpile remains adequate.\nHowever, this is a “stop-gap” measure and will need to be complemented with longer-term strategies, such as enhancing cooperation and building networks with countries around the world, he said.\nMr Heng cited the joint ministerial statement issued by Singapore and six other countries last week, which highlighted the commitment by these countries to maintain\xa0open supply chains amid the\xa0COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe ministers also said they would ""work closely"" to identify and address trade disruptions and barriers that could impact the flow of necessary goods.\nExpecting “several more countries” to join in the coming months, Mr Heng said: “This is a way in which we can assure one another of our supply chain activity, and that is one way we can continue to have a security of supply.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     COVID-19 ', '     property ', '     tax ', '     law ']}"

      COVID-19: Law firms see rise in queries on employee rights, employer obligations as economy slows
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Some law firms are seeing a\xa0surge in queries on employee rights and employer obligations as the economy takes a hit from the COVID-19 outbreak, with the Government issuing guidelines on retrenchments and cost-cutting.\nEmployees have asked about their rights as contract staff or permanent staff and what to do if they are laid off without any retrenchment incentives, while employers have sought legal advice on whether they can retrench workers during the pandemic.\nOne firm, IRB Law, has seen ""non-stop inquiries"" from both employers and employees, while Tembusu Law has seen a 50 per cent increase in such inquiries and Withers KhattarWong\xa0an increase of 30 to 40 per cent.\nTembusu Law managing director Jonathan Wong said some of the most common questions his firm has received are on whether employers can reduce wages\xa0in light of the current COVID-19 situation and whether they can dismiss or terminate employees now.\nThe answer? It\xa0largely depends on the terms of employment set out in an employee\'s contract, while the method and manner of termination is governed by the employment contract or the Employment Act.\n\nOver at Withers KhattarWong, clients have been sending in queries about how to navigate the climate and tap government support, such as a Singapore-based hotel operator hoping to receive wage offsets given to hotel owners but not managers.\nOne client who planned to undertake a retrenchment exercise before COVID-19 broke out is holding off to reduce hardship on its employees and exploring other cost-cutting alternatives instead, Withers partner Amarjit Kaur told CNA.\nIRB Law partner Muntaz Zainuddin said that a person who is retrenched under the guise of termination can report the company to the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) for unlawful dismissal, as there are guidelines on retrenchment benefits a company must abide by.\n""The guidelines provide that retrenchment is assumed if more than five employees are let go in a period of six months for a company that has more than 10 workers,"" said Ms Muntaz. ""In these cases, notifications to MOM are compulsory.""\nShe added that other evidence that a termination is actually retrenchment includes a reorganisation of the company that amalgamates or extinguishes a department or division.\nONE WOMAN QUESTIONS CIRCUMSTANCES OF HER RECENT FIRING\nOne woman who was laid off earlier this year started questioning the circumstances of her firing after it happened, and even now is unsure about her employment rights.\nThe 34-year-old woman, who gave her name only as Ms Alice, told CNA that she had worked at an events company for more than a decade before being told of her termination.\nThe company had already been struggling and had let go a few employees late last year, but the local impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has made things much worse. However, while Ms Alice was also shown the door, her ex-colleagues kept their job - albeit on reduced wages - leading her to question the circumstances of her departure.\nMs Alice, then a full-time project manager, said she was not given alternatives of taking pay cuts or no-pay-leave.\nThe pregnant woman said she was told that the reason for her termination was that ""business was bad"" because of COVID-19, and was told ""up to you"" when asked when her last day would be.\nAsked if she felt her former company violated any laws, Ms Alice said: ""I think it\'s very hard to say with all this virus going on. Maybe they are not aware?""\nShe said she felt that it was unfair when she went home and thought about it.\n""When I was let go, I agreed to everything because ... it\'s on the spot. When I went home, I was thinking - What should the company be doing for me instead, because I am pregnant, so can they even terminate me at this point of time?""\xa0\nAt the time of her dismissal, her husband had been jobless, and only just received a job offer recently.\n""I\'m still looking for a job,"" said Ms Alice, who has two sons. ""Hopefully I get something.""\nShe said she does not wish to take action against her company as she had worked there for many years, but lawyers say she might have a case for wrongful dismissal.\nInvictus Law director Darren Tan said the description of Ms Alice\'s termination is a violation of employment laws, but added that it also depends on the company\'s reason for her termination.\nWHAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS SAID\nHe referred to the updates to the Tripartite Advisory on Managing Excess Manpower and Responsible Retrenchment released last month in view of the evolving COVID-19 situation.\nUnder the guidelines, companies are urged to consider alternatives to retrenchment such as redeployment, no-pay leave, flexi-hours or adjusting of wages.\nMr Tan explained that the tripartite guidelines are a type of ""soft law"", not a law that can be enforced, but not something employers can ignore.\nOn top of this, the National Wages Council released guidelines earlier this week urging employers to first reduce non-wage costs and turn to Government support, and to retrench only as a last resort.\nLawyer Amarjit Kaur said that employers looking to undertake retrenchment or alternative cost-cutting measures should familiarise themselves with the recently amended Tripartite Guidelines on Managing Excess Manpower and Responsible Retrenchment, The National Wage Council\'s 2020/2021 Guidelines and the MOM\'s Guide on Second Job Arrangements for Employees with Reduced Work Hours.\nTembusu Law\'s Mr Wong said that ""these are indeed unique and uncertain times with unprecedented challenges and changes on the horizon"".\n""We advise both employers and employees to take holistic and long-term views of their manpower and employment needs,"" he said.\n""It may be prudent for both employers and employees to look beyond contractual or legal rights and, rather, consider making decisions based on what is ultimately more pragmatic and practical in terms of keeping their business afloat and their employment alive respectively.""\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\n', 'related_topics': ['     law ', '     employment ', '     MOM ', '     COVID-19 ']}"

      Necessary for Singapore to fast-track COVID-19 laws amid unprecedented situation: Lawyers
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: In the past month, Singapore has fast-tracked a slew of regulations and laws aimed at limiting the number of COVID-19 cases, which crossed the 2,000 figure on Friday (Apr 10).\nSome of the measures are also designed to help cushion the financial impact of the global pandemic on local businesses and members of the public.\nLawyers told CNA that some of these laws have been passed at uncommon speed, in a single day compared with the usual months-long period.\xa0\nWhile the situation bears some resemblances to the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak, the current crisis is unique in its severity, and the legal steps taken are necessary to combat the situation, they said.\xa0\nThe Bill for the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act 2020, a set of laws imposing restrictions on the movement of people and the conducting of business during the circuit breaker period between Apr 7 and May 4, was read and debated on Apr 7 before being passed\xa0on the same day.\nUnder the Act, gatherings of any size are not allowed whether outside or at home, and only those in essential services are allowed to continue working. Penalties listed in the Act go up to a maximum six-month jail term, a fine of up to S$10,000, or both.\nBefore this, the Ministry of Health (MOH) put the Infectious Diseases (COVID-19 - Stay Orders) Regulations 2020 into effect from Mar 26, to give legal force to safe distancing measures and provide enhanced enforcement for breaches of stay-home notices.\nAlready, some have been charged under the new laws - for breaching stay-home notices and\xa0for organising a gathering of more than 10 people for an illegal car race.\nThat a few people have already been charged under the new laws signals the need for authorities to have the requisite powers to deal with a variety of issues arising from the COVID-19 outbreak, which is not only the severest public health threat Singapore has faced but has also wreaked havoc on the economy, said Singapore Management University\xa0law don Eugene Tan.\nTHE SPEED AND URGENCY OF CORONAVIRUS-RELATED LAWS\nLaws typically take at least a few months to come into force, and the speed at which these COVID-19-related regulations have been introduced is ""fairly unprecedented"", said Mr Chooi Jing Yen, partner at Eugene Thuraisingam LLP.\nPrime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced the introduction of circuit breaker measures on Apr 3, so it became necessary to introduce additional regulations to give these the force of law, said Mr Chooi.\nHe said the introduction and passing into law occurred ""at breakneck speed in relative terms to the timeframe in which laws are usually passed"".\n""Before a Bill is tabled in Parliament, there is usually a consultative process that can last several months, where relevant stakeholders are invited to give their input,"" he said, adding that this process can take years for complex legislation.\n""In contrast, the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Bill came into force almost immediately after being read in Parliament, without the usual gap between time of passing and time of commencement,"" he said.\nMs Diana Ngiam, associate director at Quahe Woo & Palmer, said the passing of the laws was ""intentionally expedited because of the severity of the situation"".\n""It is not common, to my knowledge, that laws are passed so expeditiously,"" she said, adding that she found it a necessary move given the unprecedented situation Singapore is in.\n""Typically, a Bill can be read a second time after at least 10 days have passed after it has been printed and circulated to Members of Parliament. Thereafter, there will be a third reading of the Bill, before it is subsequently passed by Parliament and then assented by the President before it becomes law.""\nLawyer Josephus Tan, managing director at Invictus Law, said the COVID-19-related laws are urgent as they concern public safety and any delay in enactment “could lead to a persistent large increase in COVID-19 cases in Singapore”.\nAgreeing, Withers KhattarWong partner P E Ashokan added that “these are extraordinary times, and there was a dire need for Singapore to respond swiftly to the threat which the outbreak poses to Singapore\'s public health, economy and society”.\nLAWS PASSED QUICKLY, BUT IT HAS BEEN DONE BEFORE\nHowever, while the laws tackling the coronavirus spread were passed exceptionally quickly, it has been done before and shares similarities with how the Singapore government tackled SARS in 2003.\nMr Tan\xa0pointed to how the Government amended the Infectious Diseases Act in 2003 during the SARS outbreak under a Certificate of Urgency.\nMr Ashokan said the related Bill was introduced on Apr 24, 2003, before being read a second time a day later and passed on Apr 25.\nHe also referred to how the Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill was read three times and passed on the same day in July 2010, in an urgent response to prohibit the use of sale proceeds of HDB flats as security or collateral.\nFurther back in 1973, the Control of Essential Supplies Bill was read thrice and passed on the same day, in order to empower the Government to respond to the fluctuating prices and supply of essential goods like rice, bread and oil at the time.\nMost legislation in Singapore is written by the Cabinet as a Bill, explained Mr Ashokan. It is introduced in Parliament with a first reading, and debated in a second reading at least 10 days after this unless it is an urgent Bill.\nAny amendments to the Bill will be introduced in the third reading, after which Parliament will vote on it.\nAfter this, the Presidential Council for Minority Rights will review the Bill to ensure that it does not discriminate against any racial or religious community. The exceptions to this step are Money Bills, Bills affecting Singapore\'s defence, security or public safety, and Bills certified urgent by the Prime Minister.\nThe President will give assent to the Bill after this and it will become law. The entire process could take weeks or months, depending on the situation.\nWHAT SETS COVID-19 LAWS APART\nThe laws enacted in relation to COVID-19 can be distinguished from other laws in their urgency, latitude and flexibility, as well as how they are targeted and temporary, said Mr Ashokan.\nGenerally, other types of laws are quite specific about the type and extent of powers that the Government may wield, but the COVID-19 laws give the Government ""the necessary latitude and flexibility to respond swiftly, dynamically and decisively to the COVID-19 outbreak, especially if the situation suddenly worsens or calls for an urgent intervention by the Government"", said Mr Ashokan.\nWhile other types of laws are intended to remain in force and apply until specifically repealed, these laws are specifically targeted at the coronavirus outbreak and are meant to be temporary.\n""For example, the temporary measures introduced by the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act 2020, such as temporary relief for inability to perform contracts, are intended to last for only six months,"" said Mr Ashokan. ""However, if the COVID-19 situation calls for it, the relevant minister may order for this six-month period to be extended or shortened.""\nHe added that the COVID-19 laws can be adopted, with necessary amendments, for similar situations in the future such as another disease outbreak.\nSARS VERSUS\xa0COVID-19 LAWS\nWhile the laws passed during the SARS crisis and the current outbreak are similar, one major difference is in how the COVID-19 laws are specific and temporary.\n""Nevertheless, both were passed to combat new and evolving situations and the unique challenges posed by the particular pandemic and the circumstances of the time,"" said Mr Ashokan.\nWhen SARS broke out, the Infectious Diseases Act was already in force, but SARS led to several amendments to the act.\nThese include making it an arrestable offence to break home quarantine or refuse compliance with quarantine conditions, making it an offence to provide false or misleading information for related investigations, requiring suspected cases to submit to medical examination or treatment and requiring people suspected to have exposure to the disease to act in a socially responsible manner.\n""At the time that Singapore was facing SARS, it was still working out the kinks in its policies of quarantine, surveillance, contact tracing and social distancing measures when faced with a relatively contagious and lethal disease,"" said Mr Ashokan. ""These amendments to the law, passed during the SARS crisis, reflect the refinement of such measures.""\nThe measures were general in nature and meant to remain in force and apply to all infectious diseases, in contrast to the COVID-19 laws.\nMr Chooi said that the difference in the coronavirus laws from the SARS ones “is stark”.\xa0\n“To the best of my recollection, SARS did not prompt the government to enact laws specifically to deal with it … There was certainly no enactment of a targeted parent act such as the Covid-19 (Temporary Measures) Act 2020 which gives the health minister sweeping powers to enact subsidiary legislation to curb the movement of people,” he said.\nHowever, Singapore is not alone in this - several emergency COVID-19 Bills have been passed very quickly in other countries too, reflecting the severity of the pandemic, said Mr Ashokan.\nFor example, the UK Government announced the Coronavirus Bill 2019-2021 on Mar 8 and received royal assent on Mar 26, leading to the Coronavirus Act 2020. The Act imposes restrictions and prohibitions on events and gatherings and grants the authorities powers in dealing with potentially infected people.\nIMPLICATIONS OF PASSING THE LAWS SO QUICKLY\nPassing the laws so quickly in Singapore could mean that the problem ""gets arrested as early as possible"", said Mr Ashokan.\xa0\n""It is really anyone\'s guess at this juncture, but if the COVID-19 laws were not passed so quickly, Singapore might be looking at far higher numbers of confirmed cases,” he said.\nMr Chooi said that the key implication of the new laws being passed so quickly is “public confusion over what is permitted and prohibited”.\n“Nothing like this has been done in Singapore before, and there has been an urgent need to quickly educate the public,” he said. “Otherwise, the authorities would be faced with the unenviable task of bringing large numbers of ignorant offenders to court, or of having to pick and choose its prosecutions – neither of which is a desirable outcome.”\nMs Ngiam acknowledged the possibility that people might not be fully aware of the scope and extent of the new laws that are passed in such a short span of time.\nHowever, she\xa0added that the risk of this has been minimised substantially “by the efforts of the government to promulgate and educate the public of what can or cannot be done during this period, in simple and non-legalese language,\xa0for instance, through the Gov.sg WhatsApp broadcasts”.\nWHAT HAPPENS NEXT\nCurrently, the control period or circuit breaker period lasts till May 4 under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations 2020.\nHowever, its parent, the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act 2020, can be in force for a six-month period, and the law minister can extend or shorten this period as necessary, said Mr \xa0Chooi.\n“How long these measures actually last, therefore, really depends in large part on whether or not we manage to contain the spread of COVID-19,” he said.\xa0\n“Since Part 7 of the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act 2020 gives the health minister the power to make control orders to curb the spread of COVID-19, it is not inconceivable that we may see stiffer measures being introduced if there is no improvement in the situation. As we have seen, this can be done in a matter of days.”\nBut the enactment of laws alone is not enough, said Invictus Law’s Mr Tan.\n“In my view, in order for such expedited measures to be thoroughly effective, it must be coupled with expedited enforcement to send out an effective message of deterrence,” he said.\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\n', 'related_topics': ['     law ', '     COVID-19 ']}"

      Terence Siow case: High Court sets out new framework to assess how likely offenders are to reform
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: A new framework to assess how likely offenders are to reform, which then plays into sentencing decisions, was laid out by the Chief Justice in his verdict of a molestation case on Monday (Apr 27).\nChief Justice Sundaresh Menon used this three-limbed framework in his decision to overturn National University of Singapore student Terence Siow Kai Yuan\'s sentence of probation into a two-week\xa0jail term.\xa0\nIn cases where an offender is above 21, probation can be imposed only if he displays an extremely strong propensity for reform or if there are exceptional circumstances.\nThose who successfully complete a probation order will be supervised by a probation officer and be able to carry out daily activities, and will wind up without criminal convictions on their records.\nThe three steps to discern whether an offender has an extremely strong propensity for reform\xa0are: First, the court should consider whether the offender has demonstrated a positive desire to change since the commission of the offences.\nSecond, the court should consider whether there are conditions in the offender\'s life that are conducive for\xa0helping him turn over a new leaf.\nIf the first two steps point towards an offender demonstrating an extremely strong propensity for reform, the court should take the third step: To consider if there are any risk factors that might lead to the offender re-offending.\nIt should then consider if there are reasons to revisit the finding of the offender having a high capacity for reform.\nTHE THREE STEPS IN DETAIL\nThe first step examines the offender\'s own resolve to change, looking at any evidence of his remorse and the progress of his rehabilitation from the time of offending and sentencing.\nThis includes looking at whether the offender has self-awareness and recognises his wrongdoing. It can play out in several ways, including a plea of guilt especially at the earliest opportunity and full and frank disclosure of criminal activities beyond the charged offences.\nWhether the offender has taken active steps showing that he is willing to take charge of his own reform is also part of the first step.\nIf he complies with rehabilitative measures such as counselling programmes or urine tests for drug cases, this will also factor positively in the first step.\nOther factors that can be considered under the first step include a lack of reoffending and whether the offences are shown to be out of character.\nThe second step scrutinises the offender\'s environment, testing if the conditions around the offender are conducive in helping him turn over a new leaf.\nNon-exhaustive factors that would help determine this step include strong support from the family, having an external support system such as a partner or religious community and external motivations for reform such as the need to provide for one\'s family.\nUnder the second step, enrolment in school is frequently accepted as a protective factor as it is a positive avenue to channel energy, court documents said.\nACADEMIC RESULTS ONLY ONE INDICATOR\nHowever, ""the quest for academic qualifications is merely one indicator of rehabilitative capacity"", and ""scholastic mediocrity or the fact that the offender is no longer in school should not be reasons by themselves to conclude that the offender is incapable of rehabilitation"", the Chief Justice stressed.\nIn this vein, an offender\'s scholastic excellence would be irrelevant in and of itself, unless a link can be drawn between his good grades and his capacity to be rehabilitated.\nIf the court is satisfied that the offender passes the first two steps, it will turn to the third step and assess the risk factors present.\nRisk factors include an association with negative peers, or the presence of bad habits such as habitual drug use, or in Siow\'s case - a persistent consumption of pornography.\nEven if adult offenders demonstrate an extremely strong propensity for reform, it does not mean that rehabilitation is automatically the chief concern.\nIf the offences are serious enough, rehabilitation could be displaced by a persistent need for deterrence and even retribution, said the Chief Justice.\n', 'related_topics': ['     crime ', '     law ']}"

      Law passed to allow virtual marriage solemnisations during COVID-19 period
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Marriage solemnisations during the COVID-19 pandemic can now be conducted virtually through a live video link, after the passing of new legislation in Parliament on Tuesday (May 5).\nUnder the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures for Solemnisation and Registration of Marriages) Bill, civil and Muslim marriage solemnisations as well as registrations can be conducted remotely during the COVID-19 period.\nThe Bill was tabled in Parliament on Monday\xa0and passed on Tuesday.\nThe new law could kick in from as early as the second half of this month, said the\xa0Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF)\xa0and the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY) in a press release.\nWhile the temporary measures are in force, there will be no need for the couple, witnesses, wali as well as the licensed solemniser, kadi or naib kadi to be physically present at the solemnisation venue, said Minister for Social and Family Development Desmond Lee in Parliament.\nCertain ""key processes"" relating to marriage that currently must be done in person, may be done via video link, and will be equally valid under the law,\xa0he added.\n""While some couples may prefer to wait until it\'s safer to celebrate their big day in person with family and friends, others may not wish to wait any longer, or may face extenuating circumstances that make postponement challenging. We want to support them,"" Mr Lee said.\nSAFEGUARDS IN PLACE\nAt the same time, there will be ""safeguards"" in place to ensure\xa0only legitimate marriages are solemnised and registered through video link, said Mr Lee.\xa0\nFor one, the Registrars of Marriages (ROM) and Registry of Muslim Marriages (ROMM) will have the discretion for each marriage application to decide whether video link can be used for verification and statutory declarations, as well as marriage solemnisations.\n“This enables the Registrars to ensure that cases that require more careful scrutiny\xa0are still handled in person, when it is safe to do so,” said Mr Lee.\nThe couple, their witnesses, and in the case of Muslim marriages, the wali, must all be physically present in Singapore, he added.\xa0\nCouples presenting foreign-issued documents for verification will still need to do so physically, said Mr Lee.\xa0This will ensure “greater scrutiny” to the veracity of documents and identity of parties.\xa0\nAs a start, priority would be given to video link processes to marriages involving at least one Singapore citizen or permanent resident, said Mr Lee.\xa0\nLast month, MSF\xa0and ROMM\xa0said that solemnisations scheduled\xa0for between the initial circuit breaker\xa0period of Apr 7\xa0and May 4 would need\xa0to be postponed, with appeals\xa0heard on a ""case-by-case""\xa0basis. The circuit breaker\xa0period has since been extended by four weeks until Jun 1.\nResponding to a question from Member of Parliament\xa0Intan Azura Mokhtar, who asked for the number of civil and Muslim marriages that have been postponed due to circuit breaker measures, Mr Lee said that a total of 2,723 marriage solemnisations were originally scheduled between Apr 7 and Jun 1.\xa0\nAbout 1,100 civil marriages and close to 200 Muslim marriages have been postponed so far, and most of the remaining marriages would have\xa0also had to be postponed if there was no video link option, said Mr Lee.\n""I would like to thank these couples for their patience and understanding during these difficult times,"" said Mr Lee.\xa0\n""It is not easy to cope with the uncertainty, especially for important life events such as getting married and starting a family.""\nDr Intan also asked whether licensed solemnisers will be provided with training to help them carry out the duty of solemnising civil marriages via video link.\xa0\n""Indeed, as this is a new process, it is important to make sure that solemnisers are comfortable and confident performing solemnisation over video link, and to ensure that the process is done properly so that the solemnisation is valid,"" replied Mr Lee.\xa0\n""ROM will be providing a set of guidelines and a basic training video to all licenced solemnisers called upon to solemnise marriages through video link. They can also approach ROM if they have any queries.""\nSolemnisers for Muslim marriages will also be trained accordingly, said\xa0Minister-in-charge of\xa0Muslim Affairs Masagos Zukifli.\n""ROMM will train kadis and\xa0naib kadi to ensure they are able to use remote technology during this period,"" said Mr Masagos.\xa0\nHe added that adaptations to the way Muslim marriages\xa0are conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic do not mean that religious imperatives are not observed.\nUnder the new law, for civil marriages, couples will also have 12 months to get married after filing a notice of marriage, instead of the current three months. This will help couples cope with the ""uncertainty"" arising from the COVID-19 situation, said Mr Lee.\n“We hope that the extension of the validity of the marriage licence will allow couples greater flexibility in planning their marriage solemnisation date as well as reduce the administrative burden,” he added.\xa0\nResponding to a question from MP Christopher De Souza, Mr Lee said that couples will be allowed to submit applications to the Registrar to cancel their notice of marriage if there were valid reasons to do so -\xa0such as the need to postpone their marriage until much later.\n""Each application for cancellation will be reviewed by the Registrar, before the Registrar cancels the notice. I would like to reassure Members that the Registrar will not allow frivolous applications to cancel notices of marriage,"" said Mr Lee.\nThe measures under the new law will apply and last until the COVID-19 pandemic improves, stressed Mr Lee. If these temporary measures turn out to be well-received by couples and there is no compromise to the integrity of the marriage process, there is a possibility this option may be extended beyond the COVID-19 period, he added.\n""It is important during these challenging times that we ensure that Singaporeans can continue with their lives, especially for key life events like marriage,"" said Mr Lee.\xa0\n""This Bill ensures that couples can continue to get married and embark on a new stage in life together - by tapping on technology and keeping to necessary precautions.""\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\n', 'related_topics': ['     COVID-19 ', '     Family ', '     law ']}"

      Commentary: Were you fired or retrenched? Your employer may not tell you the difference
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on trade, supply chains and financial markets, with a particularly devastating impact on certain industry sectors such as aviation, tourism and services.\nThis will have an inevitable knock-on effect on employment figures, with massive global job losses on the horizon.\nMore than 20 million Americans lost their jobs in April 2020.\xa0\nGeneral Electric is looking at reducing 25 per cent of its aviation workforce, and American luxury department store chain Neiman Marcus has filed for bankruptcy with another US-based retailer JC Penney expected to follow suit in the coming days.\nCloser to home, in April 2020, fashion e-commerce start-up Zilingo laid off 30 per cent of its staff, and Deliveroo announced a 25 per cent staff lay-off due to the COVID-19 economic downturn. \xa0\nIn addition, 8,663 business entities in Singapore closed shop in April 2020, double the numbers from March 2020.\nWith job losses in Singapore in 2020 projected to range from 45,000 to 200,000 by various analysts, the issue of disguised retrenchments will come sharply into focus as employers consider drastic cost-cutting measures to survive the circuit breaker and wider disruption inflicted by the pandemic.\nThis is in spite of the various support measures introduced by the government in the three budgets in 2020 to protect the jobs of Singaporeans and permanent residents.\xa0 \xa0\nIn an initial poll by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) in March, only 16 per cent of companies in Singapore said they will lay off employees.\xa0\nThe same poll in mid-April demonstrated that 23 per cent of companies anticipate reducing their workforce in the next two months, which is echoed in a separate report by Aon.\nWHY EMPLOYERS MAY DISGUISE RETRENCHMENTS\nThe uncertainty of the scope and duration of the pandemic is fuelling business concerns about the ability to maintain current headcount levels, given that manpower costs can account for a fairly large proportion of business costs, depending on how labour-intensive the industry sector is.\nUnfortunately, this can lead to “disguised retrenchments” – which are designed to look like anything but what they are in substance.\nA retrenchment is defined as termination of a permanent or contract employee’s (minimum six-month term) contract of service due to redundancy or reorganisation of the employer’s profession, business, trade or work, which would include mergers, restructuring or downsizing whether due to cash flow issues or otherwise, and judicial management.\nDisguised retrenchments gained wider attention during parliamentary debates in 2016 where it was observed that employers were terminating employment without paying retrenchment benefits.\nPressure was placed on the government to introduce measures to prevent such exploitation of employees.\nIn response, mandatory notification requirements were introduced via the promulgation of the Employment (Retrenchment Reporting) Notification 2019.\nEmployers with businesses registered in Singapore with at least 10 employees are required to notify the MOM if at least five employees are notified of retrenchment - including permanent employees and contract workers - within any six-month period.\nAs this notification requirement compels employers to furnish information on whether retrenchment benefits were paid, employers are under pressure to ensure that retrenchment exercises comply not only with contractual obligations and agreements with unions if any, but also with the Employment Act, mandatory retrenchment notifications and the Tripartite Advisory on Managing Excess Manpower and Responsible Retrenchment (Tripartite Advisory).\nThe mandatory notification regime has imposed accountability on companies to some degree.\xa0\nIt has also cast a brighter spotlight on employers mischaracterising retrenchments to circumvent the reporting requirement and to avoid paying out retrenchment benefits.\nWHAT DOES A DISGUISED RETRENCHMENT LOOK LIKE?\nGiven the stark economic landscape, the issue of responsible retrenchment deserves attention to ensure that employees aren\'t disadvantaged and given the short end of the stick. Retrenchment should only be a last resort, and should be conducted fairly and without discrimination.\nA genuine retrenchment typically occurs when a company undergoes major structural changes – for example through drastic cost cutting measures, downsizing, diminishment of existing roles, or if the employer is otherwise entering into mergers, liquidation or judicial management.\nThat said, the absence of such major change may not be conclusive of there being no retrenchment.\nCynically, some of the more common pretextual disguises for retrenchment include companies strongly suggesting to employees that they should resign, failing which the company would be compelled to dismiss them.\nThis has been traditionally viewed as helping the employee ""save face"" and to receive positive or neutral references for future job applications.\nAs for the company, when an employee resigns, it falls outside the purview of reporting obligations to MOM.\nEmployers must however note that this may give rise to constructive dismissal claims, with employees arguing that the company\'s conduct compelled a forced resignation.\nMischaracterising a retrenchment as a sacking is another common strategy.\nEmployees who have had neutral to positive performance reviews are informed of poor performance out of the blue, or without discernible basis. The onus of establishing poor performance falls on the employer, and the employer should be able to demonstrate justification for the same if challenged.\nIn 2017, Surbana Jurong purported to dismiss 54 employees for poor performance, insisting that no one had been retrenched.\nSurbana Jurong came under the MOM\'s scrutiny, and the Surbana Sackings Saga was labelled as ""unacceptable"" in Parliament. With union involvement, a settlement agreement was eventually reached with the employees.\nEmployees may also be accused of misconduct out of the blue, without any due inquiry being conducted.\nMisconduct is the only legitimate ground for employers to avoid having to provide notice or pay salary in lieu of notice, quite apart from not paying retrenchment benefits. \xa0\nDISGUISED RETRENCHMENT REARING ITS UGLY HEAD\nMany law firms, such as ours, may already be seeing an uptick in legal queries from both employers and employees about lay-offs and retrenchments, with employers seeking to reduce their cost exposure to the maximum extent, and employees fighting tooth and nail to get the most equitable separation packages possible.\nIn the past two months, we have encountered several cases of employees being abruptly terminated, without being offered retrenchment benefits by their employers.\nIn one particularly egregious example, a senior executive in a technology company was let go a week after she notified them of her pregnancy in March.\nThis termination came on the heels of a pay raise offered to her just a month prior. She was informed that she was being let go on the basis of downturn in economic conditions, but that she would not be paid retrenchment benefits.\nIn another example, a senior employee at a hotel was informed that her employment was being terminated contractually, with salary in lieu of notice. When she requested for retrenchment benefits to be paid, she was informed that her role was not being made redundant.\nAs an employee who would soon be out of the organisation, she has no means of independently verifying if this is a retrenchment, such as if her role is being phased out or if the hotel has complied with the mandatory retrenchment reporting obligations.\nWe have seen cases of expatriate senior executives lose their jobs on account of them drawing some of the highest salaries in an organisation, without attracting wage support offered by the government.\nWe are also seeing companies retrench low-wage manpower that they believe can be easily replaced, whether by automation or rehiring at a later stage.\nRECOURSE FOR DISGUISED RETRENCHMENT\nThe Employment Act provides that employees with two years\' service or more are eligible to retrenchment benefits, without specifying the quantum of such benefits.\nIf the employment contract or collective agreement provides for the quantum of retrenchment benefit, the company would be bound by it. For collective agreements, this is typically pegged at one month of retrenchment benefits per year of service.\nIn the absence of such provision, the employer and employee are to negotiate the quantum. Those with less than two years\' service should be granted a retrenchment payment out of the employer’s goodwill\nThe Tripartite Advisory urges companies to pay employees retrenchment benefits benchmarked at two weeks to one month per year of service, though this can be varied depending on a company\'s financial position and industry practice. \xa0\nWe anticipate that given the current economic headwinds, companies will be relying on these caveats to downplay their ability to pay out retrenchment benefits.\nFailure to comply with the Tripartite Advisory can lead to penalties including the curtailment of the offending company\'s work pass privileges.\nEmployees who have been wrongfully retrenched under the guise of a pretext should in the first instance attempt negotiations with employers, failing which they can file a claim at the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM), followed by the Employment Claims Tribunal, for wrongful dismissal.\nIn our experience, the TADM is closely scrutinising COVID-19-related unfair employment practices and wrongful termination claims.\nThe option of a civil suit is also available. There are also avenues that offer assistance to retrenched workers, such as Workforce Singapore\'s career support programme.\nMost importantly, employers should be transparent with their employees about the reason for termination, and should conduct the retrenchment in a non-discriminatory manner.\nA key element of this involves employers acting in good faith and being fair to employees in terms of retrenchment pay-outs.\nThis reduces confusion and dissatisfaction, which is important in ensuring continuing employee engagement and averting reputational damage to the company\'s brand in a crisis.\nDownload our app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram\nAmarjit Kaur is a Partner at Withers KhattarWong in its litigation and arbitration team.

      COVID-19 laws in force indefinitely after amendments which include new details for post-circuit breaker
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Amendments to the COVID-19 regulations, which were published in the Government Gazette just before they expired on Jun 2, mean the laws are now in force indefinitely and not just during the ""circuit breaker"" period.\nA host of other detailed amendments were published in a notice at 11.59pm on Jun 1, after the various ministries had announced new guidelines for the phases post-circuit breaker.\nThe circuit breaker was a period between Apr 7 and May 4, later extended to Jun 1, meant to curb further spread of COVID-19 in Singapore.\nThe COVID-19 regulations gave legal force to safe distancing and other such measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, to urge people to mask up and stay home unless absolutely necessary.\nHere is a list of some of the amendments published in the updated laws.\n1. The Jun 1 end date was removed\nOne of the first amendments published late last night was for the phrase ""for the period between 7 April 2020 and 1 June 2020 (both dates inclusive)"" to be removed from the section explaining when the regulations are in force.\nInstead, it has been substituted with the words ""starting 7 April 2020"", with no end date specified.\n2. What ""member of same household"" means\nNew paragraphs in the amendment now state specifically what ""member of the same household"" means.\xa0\nPreviously, it was stated that meeting anyone from a different household except for specific exceptions is illegal under the regulations.\nA person is now regarded as a member of your household if they are your spouse, your parent, child, or sibling who ordinarily\xa0lives in the same house as you.\nAlso, this now includes a person you have an agreement with, whether orally or in writing, expressly or implied, to live in the same residence.\nReferences to parents, grandparents, children, grandchildren, siblings also mean step-parents, step-grandparents, step-children, step-grandchildren, step-siblings, or adopted family members.\n3. Visiting allowances\nThe amendments also reflect the new allowances for people to socialise with specific members of the family, as previously announced.\nNow, people are allowed to visit their parents, their grandparents, or their spouse\'s parents or grandparents.\nHowever, households cannot receive more than two visitors a day, and these two people must be from the same household themselves.\n4. Social gatherings\nRegulation 6, the regulation on social gatherings that previously made all forms of socialising outside of your household illegal, has also been amended.\nNow, a person must not meet another person not from their household anywhere outside of home unless it is for work.\nThere are a few exceptions, such as for receiving education or care from a public body, a specified school or a licensed early childhood development centre.\n5. When face shields may be worn in lieu of face masks\nA person or child may wear a face shield instead of a face mask in the following scenarios:\nIf wearing a mask in the required manner leads to severe medical conditions that wearing a face shield does not, or if the person is delivering a speech, teaching or lecturing in a lecture hall, classroom, auditorium or other room and is at least a metre away from any other individual while doing so.\n6. Weddings and funerals post-circuit breaker\nWeddings can be held but only the bride and groom and eight guests are allowed\xa0to attend in person.\nThere are also specific rules for where it can be held - such as a place of worship, in the bride or groom\'s home or immediate family\'s home, or a building occupied by the Registries of Marriages or Muslim Marriages.\nPeople in charge at funeral events must take all reasonable steps to ensure that there are not more than 10 individuals attending the wake or event at any time. The usual safe distancing rules apply.\n7. Businesses in phase 1\nShops and enterprises that have resumed business must abide by newly stated obligations, such as allowing natural ventilation of the premises during working hours, having procedures and controls for assessing every visitor or customer for symptoms and refusing entry to suspected symptomatic cases.\nIf people who enter the shops are symptomatic cases and not wearing a mask, the business must try its best to provide the individual with a mask and require them to wear it, and to ask them to leave immediately.\nCommon areas must be periodically cleaned each day by law, and toilets not open to the public must be provided at all times with adequate toilet paper, liquid soap or detergent, litter bins and clean towels or hand dryers.\nDisinfecting agents like hand sanitisers, disinfectant sprays, paper towels and wipes must also be provided at all times up to a point where it is reasonably practicable, for the free use of customers, visitors and employees.\n8. Non-permitted enterprises and working from home\nAnyone who is not a permitted enterprise worker cannot work anywhere other than from home, and only through means that do not require meeting any individual in person.\nFlouting any of these regulations can earn an offender up to six months\' jail, a fine of up to S$10,000, or both for the first offence.\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\n', 'related_topics': ['     law ', '     COVID-19 ']}"

      COVID-19 court cases: Why have some people not been charged?
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: In the past few months, a slew of people have turned up in the courts to be charged and fined or jailed for their offences related to breaking COVID-19 regulations.\nSome of the cases\xa0have since prompted questions on social media from readers, with some asking why the accused in specific cases were\xa0charged, while\xa0other people mentioned were not.\nThese include: A man who was fined in court for meeting his cousin-in-law for an illegal dinner gathering, with action against his cousin-in-law not mentioned in court papers; and a woman who was fined for breaching COVID-19 regulations by letting a man into her home for massage and masturbation services, but with\xa0court documents not identifying the man nor stating\xa0any potential action against him.\nOther cases that raised such questions on why some people have not been charged include the case of a woman who was charged with going to see her boyfriend during the ""circuit breaker"" period. Her boyfriend was not charged alongside her.\xa0\nThe Robertson Quay incident, where groups of people were photographed gathering near the area, resulted in seven people being charged, but several readers left comments on why only seven were charged despite more being pictured in viral photos.\nIn response to CNA\'s questions, the Attorney-General\'s Chambers (AGC) said that every case is assessed based on its own facts and circumstances.\n""The prosecution will take into account a variety of factors, including the severity of the breach and the culpability of the offender,"" said a spokesperson.\nBREACHES CONDUCTED IN FULL VIEW OF PUBLIC: AGC\n""For instance, breaches committed in full view of the public and which deliberately defy the law are considered particularly egregious. Not only do they cause public alarm, they also mock and belittle the efforts of those who abide by the law.""\xa0\nThe Ministry of Health (MOH), the agency behind the Infectious Diseases Act and the COVID-19 regulations, shed light on one specific case: The one of Francis Soh Seng Chye, who was fined S$4,500 last month for visiting his cousin-in-law Lye Bao Ru for a dinner gathering when it was prohibited.\nMOH told CNA: ""The AGC and the MOH decided to charge Soh based on the facts and circumstances of the case, including the aggravating factor that Soh had posted about his breach of the COVID-19 regulations on social media.""\nThe ministry spokesperson added that Lye was given a composition offer of S$300 for her breach.\nThis offer refers to a composition fine, a sum that is paid out of court and differs from a fine imposed on someone by a court.\nMinister for the Environment and Water Resources Masagos Zulkifli, whose ministry\xa0fronts the enforcements for breaches of safe distancing measures, announced on Apr 11 that those caught breaking the rules will be fined S$300 immediately, referring to composition fines.\nTighter measures announced later that month meant that repeat offenders would be given\xa0composition fines of S$1,000, or prosecuted in court if it is an ""egregious"" or particularly bad case.\nWHY WEREN\'T THE SEX WORKER\'S CLIENTS CHARGED?\nLawyer Chooi Jing Yen, a partner at Eugene Thuraisingam LLP, gave possible reasons for why the client\xa0in the case of Cheng Fengzhao has not been charged.\nCheng was fined S$7,000 earlier this month\xa0for letting a 51-year-old man into her condominium unit during the circuit breaker period for massage and masturbation services.\nHowever, there was no mention in court papers of the man\'s name or whether he will be charged. Such details of another man and another sex worker at the scene were not provided, either.\n""The procurement of sex services is not illegal,"" said Mr Chooi. ""Prostitution is in fact legal in Singapore. The nuance is in the prohibitions surrounding this.""\n""This has always been an inherent tension in our legislation. For example, pimping or living off the earnings of a prostitute, running a brothel, forcing someone into prostitution and trafficking women and girls for the purposes of prostitution are all illegal under the Women\'s Charter,"" he said, adding that businesses offering massage services must be licensed under the Massage Establishments Act.\n""This explains why (Cheng) was not charged for sex work. Of course, a separate offence may be made out if she had entered Singapore based on a work permit or employment pass that they would be doing other work, but this would be an immigration or employment offence, not a sex offence,"" he said.\nCheng had come to Singapore on a work permit for a waitressing job, but never went for this job, the court heard.\nMr Chooi said the procurement of sex services in itself is not illegal, but if the customers knew that the provider of such services would have to breach safe-distancing regulations in order to provide them, they would arguably have committed an offence of abetment.\nCommenting on the case of Robertson Quay, where seven people were charged for gathering there and flouting COVID-19 regulations despite more being pictured at the scene, Mr Chooi said that more egregious offenders may be charged and the others not, in AGC\'s exercise of its prosecutorial discretion.\nProsecutorial discretion refers to the AGC\'s power to decide who to prosecute, when to prosecute and how to prosecute. This power comes from the Constitution, where Article 35(8) states: The Attorney-General shall have power, exercisable at his discretion, to institute, conduct or discontinue any proceedings for any offence.""\nIn plain terms, this means that AGC decides who to charge and who not to charge.\nA FORMER DPP COMMENTS ON\xa0HOW PROSECUTION DECISIONS ARE MADE\nLawyer Marshall Lim, a former deputy public prosecutor and deputy senior state counsel who was at AGC for eight years, explained that prosecution decisions are made only after a careful consideration of each case\'s full facts and circumstances.\n""Such decisions are always made in the public interest,"" said Mr Lim, who is now a defence lawyer at Invictus Law Corporation.\xa0\n""It is important to appreciate that the \'public interest\' is not necessarily aligned with public opinion, even if widely held, concerning any particular case.""\nAsked to define ""public interest"", Mr Lim pointed to a 2017 speech by Attorney-General Lucien Wong, which stated that prosecuting in the public interest means four things: Prosecutions are conducted in the name of the public; offences are prosecuted for the good of the public; proceedings are conducted according to values expected by the public; and action is taken in the eye of the public.\n""This necessarily means that some offences may not be prosecuted and may be dealt with through other avenues, for example, administrations of warnings, if the prosecution assesses that it is not in the public interest to initiate court prosecution,"" said Mr Lim.\nThe attorney-general also said in his 2017 speech at the Singapore Law Review Lecture that what public interest is and how prosecutorial action interacts with it is a complex topic.\n""Reasonable people often disagree on what the public interest requires in any particular situation. These disagreements only get stronger in difficult cases,"" he said. ""For example, where the behaviour of the accused evokes a visceral emotion, like anger or sympathy. Or where there is a clash of moral ideologies.""\nWhile stressing that public interest permeates all the decisions the prosecution makes, Mr Wong said ""it is not quite possible to make a definitive statement"" which will apply to all cases on what the public interest requires.\n""It has to be assessed, case by case with skill, wisdom, legal acuity and compassion,"" he said, adding that determining what is in the public interest is a matter on which they have robust debates within the AGC every single day.\nOTHER FACTORS SUCH AS AN OFFENDER\'S PERSONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\nMr Chooi gave another view on why some people may not be charged.\n""There may also be other factors such as each offender’s personal circumstances or reasons for offending, which the AGC may or may not take into account in deciding whether to charge that particular offender,"" he said.\xa0\n""This again, is the exercise of prosecutorial discretion. Sometimes, we may see it as compassion.""\nOne other factor, he said, is whether the police have gathered enough evidence to ensure a successful prosecution in the view of the AGC.\n""Sometimes, there may be prima facie evidence of an offence being committed, but it may not be strong enough depending on what the defence is,"" he said. ""In such cases, prosecutorial discretion may be exercised to divert resources towards more clear-cut cases.""\n""In truth, millions of people flout millions of laws every day, in some way or another, whether regulatory or otherwise,"" said Mr Chooi. ""Not every breach needs to be prosecuted. Prosecutorial discretion acts as a filter to avoid overburdening the state with prosecutions, and the courts with cases.""\nAGC said it would like to remind the public that there are ""serious repercussions for breaching the heightened safe distancing measures which were put in place to safeguard public health"".\xa0\n""Everyone should comply with the prevailing measures, and cooperate with public officers tasked with assisting the public and enforcing the regulations,"" said the spokesperson.\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\n', 'related_topics': ['     crime ', '     COVID-19 ', '     AGC ', '     MOH ', '     law ']}"

      Former Drew &amp; Napier lawyer jailed for taking upskirt and other photos of colleague in the office
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: A former legal associate at top law firm Drew & Napier was sentenced to four weeks\' jail on Monday (Jun 8) for taking compromising photos of a female colleague in the office.\nThe man\'s name and age cannot be published due to a gag order on his identity. The victim\'s identity is protected.\nHe had initially claimed trial, but pleaded guilty midway to two charges of insulting the modesty of a woman. Another two charges of outraging and insulting her modesty were taken into consideration.\nThe court heard that the offender worked at the law firm situated at the\xa0Ocean Financial Centre and was in the same team as the victim.\nThe accused, the victim and another colleague frequently went for meals and movies together, but the accused knew that the victim had a long-term boyfriend at the time.\nIn April 2017, the victim was staying back late to finish her work when the accused decided to take compromising photos of her to ""ease his stress"", knowing that she was alone.\nShe was seated facing her computer, when the man leaned over on the pretext of reading her computer screen. He asked her what she was working on\xa0and she replied that she was working on a set of legal submissions.\nHe then peeped at the woman, before positioning his handphone and taking several photographs of her chest and bra.\nHe wished her good luck before going back to his room, where he looked at the photos. He returned a while later and took several photographs of her underwear before leaving. He deleted the photos after looking at all of them.\nTHE SECOND INCIDENT\nThe next incident occurred on Oct 11, 2017, when the victim was eating lunch alone in her room at the office.\nThe man asked the woman what she was eating, but became sexually aroused and decided to take upskirt photos of her.\nAs he pointed the camera lens of his phone in the direction of the victim\'s thighs, the woman noticed this and swivelled her chair back under her desk so that her legs were underneath.\nThe man tried to get her to face him again, asking if he could see what she was having for lunch\xa0and she swivelled her chair towards him to show him her lunch.\nWhen she went back to face her desk, the man prompted her to show him her lunch again and she turned back to him.\nDuring this time, the man\xa0took several photos of the woman\'s underwear.\xa0\nWhen she crossed her legs, the man asked the victim if it was ""painful for females to sit cross-legged for too long\xa0and how long she could sit cross-legged for"".\nHe stood up and rested his buttocks on the victim\'s desk, pressing his thigh against her upper arm, an action that forms the molest charge that was taken into consideration.\nAfter this, the man went to his room where he looked at the upskirt photos before deleting them.\nHE BETRAYED THEIR FRIENDSHIP: PROSECUTION\nDeputy Public Prosecutors Kelly Ho and Sheldon Lim asked for at least six weeks\' jail for the man, noting that he had ""betrayed"" his friendship with the victim ""in the most callous way"", by taking multiple upskirt and ""down-blouse"" photographs of her in their shared workplace.\n""Many Singaporeans spend long hours in the office, so much so that the office becomes a second home, and colleagues become close friends,"" they said. ""This was true for the offender and the victim. They ... endured the same trials and tribulations that all junior lawyers undergo.""\nDespite this, the man betrayed the trust of the woman, who had developed a friendship with him over meal outings and late nights working together.\nWhen the woman realised that her friend had taken advantage of her, she felt ""betrayed and confused"", her turmoil ""amplified by the fact that she could not avoid or ignore the offender as she had to continue working with him on a day-to-day basis in the office"", said the prosecutors.\nShe went through a period of self-loathing and shame, feeling responsible for what happened despite not doing anything to invite the offender\'s unwanted intrusions, and felt a ""deep disgust"" over what happened to her.\nTHE WOMAN\'S TURMOIL\nShe experienced bouts of insomnia, nightmares and had to attend counselling. She also carried an umbrella to work each day for self-protection and avoided the offender during lunchtimes.\nAfter she filed a police report, the man tried to convince her to drop the case against him by threatening to commit suicide and telling her how the case hurt his sick mother.\nHe also attempted to sway the victim indirectly\xa0by reaching out to their mutual friends and colleagues and saying\xa0that he was suicidal.\n""Many of them reached out to (her) and expressed their concern, not for her, but for the offender,"" said the prosecution. ""The emotional blackmail caused her so much pain and guilt that she began to engage in self-harm.""\nFrom the outset, the woman wanted nothing more than to forget all that had happened, but could not do so as she knew - as a lawyer - the importance of remembering the details for cross-examination.\nThe prosecutors said the man\'s actions were persistent and premeditated. They added that there is an urgent need for deterrent sentences, pointing out that the number of technology-facilitated sexual offending cases seen by the Association of Women for Action and Research’s (AWARE) Sexual Assault Care Centre has more than doubled between 2016 and 2018.\nHE HAD TO LEAVE LAW JOBS: DEFENCE\nDefence lawyer Tan Hee Joek asked instead for a week\'s jail for each proceeded charge, saying that his client was a first-time offender and had taken the pictures when he was ""suffering under immense stress"".\nHe said no record of incriminating photos was found in the man\'s phone and that the pictures did not involve genitalia.\nHe said a psychiatrist found that the offender\'s acts of taking upskirt photos were ""impulsive"" acts arising from his undiagnosed and untreated condition of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.\nThe offender resigned from Drew & Napier in late 2017 and found another job at another law firm, said Mr Tan.\nHe now works for an overseas firm.\nThe man has also written an apology to the victim, with his lawyer saying that the offender had safely escorted the victim home once despite ""her heavily intoxicated state"".\nFor each charge of insulting a woman\'s modesty, the man could have been jailed for up to a year, fined\xa0or both.\nIn a statement to CNA after the sentencing, Drew & Napier said its firm has ""a strict zero-tolerance policy towards misconduct of any nature"".\xa0\n""Our colleagues work hard to maintain a supportive and respectful work environment with an open-door policy. We are fully committed to ensuring that every single member of our firm feels safe\xa0and that reported cases of misconduct, sexual or otherwise\xa0are responded to swiftly. Appropriate steps were taken when the allegations came to light.""\n', 'related_topics': ['     crime ', '     law ']}"

      Commentary: Apple has a battle with regulators and unhappy developers
  </h1>, 'text': 'LONDON: Software developers talk about technical debt, meaning the cost of rewriting quick and dirty code to make it fit for purpose. If not repaid, then tech debt, like the monetary kind, can incur “interest”, making change even more expensive to implement later.\nCultural debt may be a similar phenomenon in many businesses, particularly in the tech sector. The fast-moving, risk-taking, win-at-all costs corporate culture that enabled a start-up like Uber to succeed is too buggy for a global public company and has to be updated.\nOne intriguing question is whether Apple will have to repay its cultural debt as it squares up for a fist-fight with regulators. Will the monomaniacal culture that allowed it to become one of the most successful and profitable businesses in history need to be reimagined?\nCASES FILED\nLast month, the European Union (EU) launched two antitrust cases against Apple.\xa0\nThe first concerns the operations of Apple’s App Store following complaints from Spotify, the music-streaming service, and Kobo, the ebook business.\xa0\nEach has attacked the company for demanding an initial 30 per cent cut of the subscription fee from all customers who sign up via the App Store, while promoting its own rival music and books services.\nMargrethe Vestager, EU vice-president in charge of competition policy, said Apple appeared to be acting as a discriminatory “gatekeeper” controlling the distribution of apps while keeping most of the data derived from them. “We need to ensure that Apple’s rules do not distort competition in markets where Apple is competing with other app developers,” she said.\nThe second investigation focuses on whether Apple unfairly denies Apple Pay’s “tap and go” functionality on iPhones to rival payments companies.\nBoth cases are likely to be argued for many years by teams of high-powered lawyers. Apple’s response to the probes has been predictably furious. The company argues that it invented and built the App Store that now reaches 1.5 billion device users. If developers do not like its rules then they do not have to play.\nMillions of developers, who have made a lot of money from the App Store, are happy with the way it operates and comforted by the security it offers. Besides, Apple charges no fees on the 85 per cent of apps that are free to users.\nThis reflects the uncompromising attitude of the company’s founder, Steve Jobs, who acknowledged that the introduction of the 30 per cent charge in 2011 might result in some “roadkill” among developers. Apple has denounced the latest complainants as “free-riders” and signalled its determination to fight.\xa0\nIt will be fascinating to see whether Apple maintains its aggressive stance as the regulatory pressure increases. The EU’s scrutiny seems to have emboldened other developers.\xa0\nBase camp, which runs the Hey premium email service, has even accused Apple of running a mafia-style protection racket.\nSuch complaints are increasingly attracting the attention of US legislators, who have summoned the bosses of the big tech companies to Washington later this month.\xa0\nDavid Cicilline, the Democratic congressman who chairs the antitrust subcommittee of the House judiciary committee, has described Apple’s bullying of developers into paying the 30 per cent fee as “highway robbery”.\xa0\nHe has threatened to legislate to curb Apple’s monopoly powers. “It’s contrary to our laws. It’s unfair to new developers, new start-ups, and it hurts consumers,” he said.\nAPPLE HAS TWO CHOICES\nApple has an interesting choice to make. It can simply tough out this regulatory scrutiny while it continues to generate an estimated US$1 billion of revenue a month from the App Store.\xa0\nIt can count on the EU taking years to reach a ruling while the US Congress may never legislate. For some big tech companies, fines have become no more than the cost of doing business.\nYet Apple may also see virtue in defanging the most critical of its 23 million developers by modifying the way the App Store operates to benefit all parties.\nThe history of Microsoft in the 1990s is instructive. While Bill Gates was running the company, Microsoft was contemptuous of complainants and regulators, and ended up entangled in distracting legal fights for 16 years before finally rebooting its own culture. Led by the more consensual Satya Nadella, it has vaulted back to rival Apple as the top US companies by market capitalisation.\nIt is pretty certain that Jobs would have adopted Mr Gates’s combative approach. But that does not make it right for Apple today. It may make more sense, and may ultimately make Apple more money, for it to repay its cultural debt and negotiate more flexible terms with disgruntled developers.\nJohn Thornhill is the Innovation Editor at the Financial Times writing a regular column on the impact of technology.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Apple ', '     technology ', '     law ', '     Microsoft ']}"

      MHA to review penalty framework following sentencing of NUS student in strangling case
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Penalty frameworks, how they are applied and how certain factors like an offender\'s educational background are taken into account\xa0are among certain policies to be reviewed, said Home Affairs and Law\xa0Minister K Shanmugam on Tuesday (Jul 21).\nHe made these remarks in response to the sentencing of a National University of Singapore undergraduate who trespassed into his ex-girlfriend\'s home,\xa0strangled her and injured her eye. The student\xa0was given community-based sentences.\nSpeaking to the media via Zoom, Mr Shanmugam said ""there are strong feelings on the punishment"", adding that female Members of Parliament (MPs) have spoken to him.\n""I entirely understand their feelings,"" he said, adding that his own officers in the\xa0Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) have ""very strong feelings too"".\n""We need to deal with this as a matter of policy. So I\'ve asked my ministry, MHA, to do a review on what penalties should be applied,"" he said.\nThere are three areas to be covered in the review, on which Mr Shanmugam will make a statement in Parliament after it is completed.\nThese are: The penalties for ""such cases in general"", with the minister declining to elaborate if they are for specific offences; the extent to which an offender\'s educational background and other factors should be relevant or not; and the relativity in punishment between this offence and other offences, for example how the punishment for a hurt offence compares to\xa0theft or spitting.\n""We will consult stakeholders on this,"" he said. ""The penalty framework in the end must make sense. And when the review is finalised, I will make a statement in Parliament.""\nTHE OFFENDER\'S SENTENCING\nLast week, Yin Zi Qin was given a short detention order for 12 days, a day reporting order for five months with counselling and an order to complete 80 hours of community service over a year.\nUnder a short detention order, an offender can be detained in prison for a period not exceeding 14 days, according to the State Courts\' website.\nDay reporting orders are administered by the Singapore Prison Service and require offenders to report to a day reporting centre for monitoring, counselling and to undergo rehabilitation programmes.\nCommunity service orders are imposed to reform offenders and for them to make amends to the community by performing unpaid community service under the supervision of an authorised officer.\nIn sentencing Yin, the judge noted that while probation was not appropriate in this case, Yin\'s\xa0relative youth, rehabilitative prospects and lack of previous convictions made community sentences\xa0a viable option.\nHis sentence sparked outrage online, with petitions being launched against it and NUS releasing a statement shortly after to state that Yin has been suspended and is not allowed on campus.\nThe People\'s Action Party\'s (PAP) Women\'s Wing and female PAP Members of Parliament also said in a statement on Tuesday that they are ""dismayed"" by the ""disproportionate"" sentence meted out.\nMr Shanmugam\xa0said he would not be commenting on the specific facts of Yin\'s case. While he said he thought it is ""natural"" for people to look at the courts when they are unhappy, he stressed that judges decide based on what is presented to them.\n""I think courts are not the issue. Courts are independent. When we disagree, the approach should be to look at the legal policy framework, which the Government can change,"" he said.\xa0\nHe stressed that the laws here protect the ""vulnerable and the weak"".\xa0\n""Of course, women\'s protections in Singapore are very high, and we have to continue to make sure that it is so, both in terms of the framework and the application,"" said Mr Shanmugam, who did not give a specific timeline for the review.\nAsked if the backlash was in\xa0part due to previous cases such as the case of NUS undergraduate Terence Siow, who molested a woman, the minister pointed to new offences enacted on voyeurism and enhanced penalties for existing crimes.\nHe added that Yin\'s specific offence of voluntarily causing hurt has ""stiff"" penalties. For his offence committed in 2019, he could have been jailed for up to two years, fined a maximum S$5,000, or both.\nThe penalties for voluntarily causing hurt have recently been increased - the maximum jail term is now three years for such offences committed from January this year.\nMs Sim Ann, Senior Minister of State in the Ministry of Communications and Information and the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY), also made remarks on the case to the media, shortly after Mr Shanmugam.\nShe said youths have been ""quite prepared to speak their mind"" on issues around the case, and encouraged those who have been following the case to join discussion sessions to be organised by MCCY and the National Youth Council.\nThe Attorney-General\'s Chambers told CNA on Tuesday evening that it will not be appealing Yin\'s case.\n', 'related_topics': ['     crime ', '     law ']}"

  </h1>, 'text': 'CHENNAI: It took a while for Indians to learn how a father and son died in hospital with blood pouring from their rectum, days after police in small southern town locked them up for violating a nationwide coronavirus lockdown.\nFanned by media reports, outrage spread throughout India over what happened between Jun\xa019 and Jun\xa023 in Sathankulam, a town on the subcontinent\'s southern tip, 2,785km from the capital New Delhi.\nA month earlier, many Indians noted how commonplace police brutality was in their own country when they saw the furious global reaction to images of George Floyd, a black American man, dying as a Milwaukee policeman knelt on his neck.\nYet, despite nearly 800 custodial deaths in India in the latest eight years covered by official data, no police officers were convicted in any of the cases.\nCharges have yet to be laid in Sathankulam, and it is uncertain whether investigations into the deaths of J Jayaraj, 59, and his son, 31-year-old Bennicks Immanuel will lead to prosecutions, but five officers have been named as murder suspects.\nJayaraj, the owner of a mobile phone shop, was detained on Jun\xa019 after exchanging words with officers who accused him of breaking lockdown rules.\nThat night, accompanied by friends, including two lawyers, Immanuel went to the police station looking for his father.\nWhen he remonstrated with officers over why his father had been beaten, he was locked up too, his friends told Reuters.\nBoth men, allegedly, were brutally beaten while in custody, taken to hospital, and then transferred to jail.\n""When they sat on a chair in the hospital and in a car when they were taken to the magistrate, they left blood trails. That\'s how much they were bleeding,” said S. Rajaram, one of lawyers. Other witnesses asked for their names to be withheld, fearing police retribution.\nImmanuel, described as fit and healthy by his family, died on Jun\xa022. His father died on Jun\xa023. They were buried together a day later.\nJayaraj\'s eldest daughter recounted what male relatives and friends had told her and photographs had shown.\n""You should see the bedsheet they were sitting on while being transported to the jail. It was full of blood. And this was hours after they were brought to a hospital,"" J Persis, the daughter, told Reuters.\nThe case prompted popular news channels Times Now and Republic TV to run prime time debates on police conduct, and there were biting commentaries in op-ed pages of national dailies.\n""Coming so soon after the George Floyd incident in the US, the Sathankulam episode should shock our conscience,"" RK Raghavan, a former Central Bureau of Investigation director, wrote in The Hindu newspaper.\nAs the media storm gathered, a court in Madurai, in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, ordered the case to be made a murder probe.\nAs each state has its own police force under India\'s federal system, the CBI, an agency equivalent to the US Federal Bureau of Investigation, was tasked with investigating.\nOn Jul\xa01, the first policeman was detained. By Jul\xa09, cases had been filed against the five police suspected of murder, and five suspected of abetting them.\nReuters was unable to establish whether any of them had appointed lawyers.\nTamil Nadu\'s police chief did not respond to a request for comment for this story. The office of Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edapadi Palaniswami did not respond either, though he has previously said action would be taken ""as per the law.""\nINACTION\nIndia is a country of 1.3 billion people with massive social problems, but it is also a democracy, with strong laws, a vibrant media and active public interest litigation lawyers. So, when abuses happen someone usually speaks up, even if culprits often avoid jail.\nYet out of the 783 custodial deaths between 2010 and 2018, National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) records shows charges were only filed in over a sixth of the cases.\nAnd there were no convictions.\nAccording to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), the NCRB data understates the scale of the problem. It put the annual average for custodial deaths at 143, some 46 per cent higher than the NCRB average of 98.\nCaste and religious frictions sometimes play a part in custodial deaths in India, while some are suspected extra-judicial killings of criminals who ""were trying to escape"".\nBut a common denominator for many cases, legal experts say, can be boiled down to the brutish behaviour of officers who know their colleagues will keep their mouths shut.\nYet, the NCRB data shows that nearly 16 per cent of custodial deaths in the five years through 2018 were explicitly classified as being due to ""physical assault"" by police.\n""There are very few witnesses in custodial deaths because mostly the witnesses are people who are on duty, who don\'t support the investigation,"" said Ravi Kant, president of the National Network of Lawyers for Rights and Justice and a senior advocate at India\'s Supreme Court.\nNeither the home or justice ministries responded to requests for comment on the dearth of convictions.\nIndia\'s law commission - an executive body responsible for legal reform - had twice recommended - once in 1985 and again in 1994 - that if there was evidence that a person was injured in custody, courts could assume the injuries were caused by police.\nMore than 25 years later, however, the recommendations have yet to be adopted.\nA report released in 2016 by the National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC), a rights body for people born into the lowest rung of India\'s caste hierarchy, highlighted cases of men in custody being tortured by having heavy stones tied to their genitals, and women having chilli powder and petrol poured on their genitalia.\nThe report was submitted to India\'s president, but two of the authors said no action has been taken yet. The President\'s office did not respond to requests seeking comment.\n', 'related_topics': ['     India ', '     police ', '     death ', '     lockdown ', '     COVID-19 ', '     law ']}"

      Law Society seeks to disbar Lee Suet Fern over Lee Kuan Yew's will, defence asks for charges to be dismissed
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The Law Society (LawSoc) on Thursday (Aug 13) sought to have veteran lawyer Lee Suet Fern struck off the roll for professional misconduct over the handling of Singapore\'s founding prime minister Lee Kuan Yew\'s final will.\nMrs Lee, the wife of Lee Kuan Yew\'s son Lee Hsien Yang, has been a lawyer for more than 37 years and is listed online as a director at Morgan Lewis Stamford.\nMrs Lee\'s lawyers, Senior Counsels Kenneth Tan and former Attorney-General Walter Woon, urged the court to dismiss all the charges against her, arguing that Lee Kuan Yew knew what he was doing.\nThe Court of Three Judges, the highest disciplinary body dealing with lawyers\' misconduct, heard arguments from both sides for five hours on Thursday before reserving judgment. The decision will be released at a later date.\nThe disciplinary tribunal had earlier found Mrs Lee guilty of two charges of grossly improper conduct as a lawyer.\xa0\nThese are: By failing to advance Lee Kuan Yew\'s interests by preparing and arranging for the execution of his will when a third of Lee Kuan Yew\'s estate was to be given to her husband, and by failing to advise Lee Kuan Yew to be independently advised in respect of this one-third of his estate her husband stood to gain.\nLee Kuan Yew had written seven wills, the first six of which were prepared by his lawyer Kwa Kim Li.\xa0\nHowever, Ms Kwa was not involved in the last will, with Mrs Lee purportedly handling it as Ms Kwa was away and Lee Kuan Yew had asked for his first will to be used as his final will. The will was prepared and executed in December 2013.\nThe last will differed from the sixth will as it restored the equal shares of the estate among Lee Kuan Yew\'s three children - Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, Lee Hsien Yang and Lee Wei Ling, and reintroduced the clause asking for the late Mr Lee’s house at\xa038 Oxley Road\xa0to be demolished.\nThe disciplinary tribunal had found that Mrs Lee made Lee Kuan Yew sign this will ""urgently"" without the presence or involvement of Ms Kwa, in direct contravention of rules governing solicitors that prohibit lawyers from preparing wills when their family members stand to get ""significant gifts"" under the will.\nSHE MERELY FORWARDED THE WILL: DEFENCE\nHowever, Mrs Lee\'s lawyers argued that she had merely forwarded a copy of the first will that she had obtained from her husband Lee Hsien Yang, and was not involved in actually handling the will.\xa0\nTherefore, she did not act as his lawyer and there was no breach of any rules and no sanctions should be called for.\nEven if there was a technical breach of the rules, there should be no sanction, argued Prof Woon.\nReferring to Lee Kuan Yew as MM or Minister Mentor, Prof Woon said: ""(Even if there\'s a) technical breach ... it still goes back to the question, in that case, is there any meaningful sanction? MM was himself a lawyer. He was a brilliant lawyer. A will is not a complex document. He read it, he understood it.""\nHe said Lee Kuan Yew had told his personal assistant to inform his regular lawyer Ms Kwa after signing the final will that this was the agreement among his children.\n""It\'s quite clear MM knew what he was doing. There is no reason for imposition of sanctions of any sort under the Legal Profession Act,"" said Prof Woon, who made his arguments via Zoom before Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon and Justices Judith Prakash and Woo Bih Li, with Lee Hsien Yang attending as an observer.\nProf Woon also criticised the findings of the disciplinary tribunal, saying that its case that Lee Kuan Yew had been tricked was ""improbable in the extreme"", and saying it was unacceptable for the tribunal to criticise Mrs Lee and her husband\'s integrity without clear evidence to support its conclusions.\n""The theory of the case propounded by the disciplinary tribunal is improbable in the extreme, that MM was tricked, that he was a frail 90-year-old man, that they rushed him into signing a will he did not want to sign,"" said Prof Woon.\n""The truth was that (Mrs Lee) forwarded the will and she got members of her firm to stand by. Anyone who\xa0has dealt with MM would understand him. He was not known to be a patient man. If he wanted the will, they were ready.\xa0\n""He read the will, he signed the will, initialled on every page, called for it the following day, told his personal assistant to send it to (Ms Kwa) and tell her it\'s the agreement among the siblings,"" said Prof Woon.\n""The inescapable inference is that this is exactly what MM wants. If this is the case, the disciplinary tribunal was wrong to criticise (Mrs Lee) and accuse her of lying, wrong to criticise Lee Hsien Yang and accuse him of lying.""\nThe disciplinary tribunal had found Mrs Lee to be a ""deceitful witness, who tailored her evidence to portray herself as an innocent victim who had been maligned"".\nIt also called Lee Hsien Yang\'s conduct ""equally deceitful"", saying that he had ""lied to the public"" and to the tribunal, trying to ""hide how he and his wife had misled his own father, Mr Lee (Kuan Yew), on the last will"".\nProf Woon said LawSoc had not proven that Mrs Lee was Lee Kuan Yew\'s lawyer, arguing that she was instead functioning as a wife of his son, who happened to have a law firm.\nTRIBUNAL\'S FINDING DISHONOURS\xa0MEMORY OF LEE KUAN YEW: WALTER WOON\n""If we look at the totality of the evidence, knowing that MM would have understood (the will), there is no case for the imposition of sanctions,"" argued Prof Woon. ""The disciplinary tribunal\'s finding that he was a 90-year-old frail man who didn\'t understand his will despite reading and rereading it ... (he) was basically a dotard, that is what the tribunal is saying.""\n""May I say this dishonours the memory of Lee Kuan Yew. You are saying to the world that he was a doddering old dotard. And this is unacceptable. All the charges should be dismissed, every single one.""\nHe added that Lee Kuan Yew\'s final will was ""not a new will"" but an old one previously signed in 2011 and deliberated on with his family and his lawyer.\nAddressing the charge that said Mrs Lee should have advised Lee Kuan Yew to get independent advice, Prof Woon said: ""What was she supposed to advise? Are you sure you want to give a one-third share to my husband?\n""To go to MM and say - I can\'t do this, you need to get independent legal advice is actually insulting to his intelligence. It implies he doesn\'t know what he was doing. He would\'ve exploded. The sound of the explosion would\'ve been heard all the way to the Istana.""\nHe said LawSoc and the disciplinary tribunal had been ""concentrating on the trees without appreciating the forest"", saying it was not sufficient just to show that there was a breach, but that the conduct was sufficient to warrant sanctions.\nLawSoc\'s lead counsel, WongPartnership\'s Koh Swee Yen, urged the court to uphold the tribunal\'s findings and impose the most severe sanctions on Mrs Lee.\nTRIBUNAL FOUND LEE SUET FERN LACKING IN CREDIBILITY: LAWSOC\nMs Koh urged the court to look at the tribunal\'s findings on Mrs Lee\'s and her husband\'s ""lack of credibility"".\nThe tribunal had found their explanations for changing positions ranging from ""improbable to patently contrived to downright dishonest"".\nIn particular, the argument that Lee Hsien Yang had been the one who forwarded the will to his wife was a new contention that came up only before the tribunal and not before then, with no explanation on why it was raised only later.\n""What really aggravates this is the fact that (Mrs Lee) and her husband were able to produce emails back in 2013, but did not produce any emails that show there was this act of Lee Hsien Yang forwarding the will to Lee Suet Fern,"" said Ms Koh.\xa0\nShe pointed to the context of LawSoc having to apply for documents that Mrs Lee had but ""chose not to produce"", and highlighted the tribunal\'s finding that Mrs Lee ""suppressed material evidence to prevent (the) truth from coming to light"".\nWhat Mrs Lee should have done at that point in time in December 2013 was to wait for Ms Kwa to return instead of going ahead to forward the will to Lee Kuan Yew.\nMs Koh argued that Mrs Lee created a situation where Lee Kuan Yew\'s usual lawyer was ""displaced"" from the preparation and execution of his last will, leaving herself as the only lawyer in the situation.\nLawSoc\'s stand is that Mrs Lee took instructions from Lee Kuan Yew, but Mrs Lee\'s lawyers disagree with this, saying that the instructions he had given were to his son Lee Hsien Yang and there was no evidence that Lee Kuan Yew had corresponded directly with Mrs Lee other than the email Mrs Lee sent to him, forwarding the will he requested.\nThe judges repeatedly grilled both LawSoc\'s lawyer and Mrs Lee\'s lawyers, taking issue with multiple arguments put forth by both sides.\nJustice Prakash asked Ms Koh to remember the charges and not put forth a different case, while Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon disagreed with Prof Woon that LawSoc had to prove not just a breach of rules, but that what was done ""is dishonourable"".\nWhile Prof Woon argued about the finer points of what may or may not have mattered to Lee Kuan Yew in his final will, Chief Justice Menon stressed: ""This is precisely why the law imposes the duties it imposes in the context of wills - it\'s because the people who are affected are usually not around to stand up and say what mattered or what didn\'t matter to them!""\nThe hearing came\xa0days after Mrs Lee\'s son, Li Shengwu, said he would pay a S$15,000 fine for contempt of court, but insisted that he did not admit guilt.\n', 'related_topics': ['     law ', '     Lee Kuan Yew ', '     Lee Hsien Yang ']}"

      Chief Justice calls on new lawyers to embrace technology, remote hearings 
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: In the first Mass Call held via Zoom in Singapore on Tuesday (Aug 25), the Chief Justice urged new lawyers to embrace technology and remote hearings in these ""unprecedented times"".\nThe Mass Call usually takes place in the High Court, with new lawyers filing in with gowns, but it proceeded via Zoom on Tuesday morning, with solicitors and advocates dialling in from their respective locations and bowing while seated when their names were called.\n""You are today playing a small role in the making of legal history as you participate in the first Mass Call in Singapore conducted using remote communication technology,"" Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon\xa0told more than a hundred new lawyers over\xa0Zoom.\n""The fact that we gather today in this way to admit new members to the Bar is a sign of the unprecedented times that we live in.""\nWhile COVID-19 has impacted the economy, it has also dissolved resistance to greater use of technology in legal processes, with the notion of non-physical courts previously rejected by judges and lawyers alike, he said.\xa0\nThe increased use of remote hearings means that litigation lawyers will have to adapt to new forms of advocacy and be proficient in arguing cases not just in person but virtually, said the Chief Justice.\xa0\n""To do so effectively, advocates will have to familiarise themselves rapidly with the features of remote hearing platforms, but more importantly learn to navigate the constraints of such platforms, as well as how to get around the limitations of having to argue a case remotely with various others in the hearing all dialing in from different locations.""\nChief Justice Menon said the new generation of lawyers ""especially proficient with technology"" has an opportunity to play in part ""in paving the way towards greater efficiency in the delivery of legal services"".\nHe pointed to how law firms in the United States reported that giving younger attorneys leading roles in innovation efforts has been critical in facilitating their pivot towards working remotely.\n""It has also been noted that younger lawyers are more likely than their more senior colleagues to request, learn and adopt technological tools that can reduce inefficiencies in legal practice,"" he said.\nHe encouraged the new lawyers to actively consider how technology can improve efficiency in the delivery of legal services.\n""You are well placed to offer fresh perspectives and creative ideas that may not occur to those of us accustomed to the old ways of practice,"" he said. ""So, be innovative in pursuing new ideas, collaborative in your approach to developing them, and bold in your efforts to actualise and publicise them.""\nTHE IMPACT OF COVID-19\nA survey by the Singapore Academy of Law conducted on about 400 local practitioners and in-house counsel in April this year found that 83 per cent of respondents reported a decrease in new cases and in revenue, said the Chief Justice.\nSeveral law firms responded initially by freezing increments, reducing hiring and cutting partner salaries, but many have since enhanced cost-saving measures by implementing firm-wide wage cuts affecting partners, junior associates and other employees, he said.\nThe pandemic may also have had an adverse effect on employment prospects of recent law graduates, said Chief Justice Menon, pointing to an anonymous survey conducted at the current Mass Call\'s rehearsal.\nAbout 19 per cent of 373 respondents, representing about 70 per cent of those entering the profession through Mass Call 2020, said they were still looking for work, while 62 per cent of this segment said they have been doing so since the pandemic began.\nWhile the figures are ""concerning"", COVID-19 has had an uneven impact, with some in-house lawyers reporting an increase in work, with ""clear signs that there are opportunities for legal professionals even in the midst of crisis"".\n""Perhaps the most enduring legacy of COVID-19 for the courts and the legal profession will be the dissolution of long-held resistance in some quarters to the greater use of technology in legal processes, and a renewed appreciation of how technology can be harnessed to sustain and enhance access to justice,"" said the Chief Justice.\xa0\n""Today, it is safe to say that remote hearings have by and large proven to be a feasible, convenient and effective solution that has helped those courts that embraced it to maintain a good level of access to justice during the pandemic.""\nThe Mass Call will be completed over Tuesday and Wednesday in four sessions, with more than 500 advocates and solicitors called to the Bar over two days.\n', 'related_topics': ['     law ']}"

  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Veteran lawyer Harry Elias, known for his role as founding chairman of the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme for those who could not afford lawyers, has died aged 83.\nHis firm, Harry Elias Partnership, said in a statement on Thursday (Aug 27) that Mr Elias, who died on Wednesday, ""was known for his compassion and contribution to society"".\nManaging partner Philip Fong of Harry Elias Partnership said Mr Elias was ""the epitome of a fearless and first-class advocate"" and ""a trailblazer with lasting legacy"". \xa0\n""For us personally, Harry was a true friend, a teacher and a kind and generous soul. We are honoured to have walked with him for a part of his impactful life.”\nAmong Singapore\'s best-known trial lawyers, the former Senior Counsel\'s death has left a ""void in the Law Society"", LawSoc president Gregory Vijayendran told CNA.\nMr Elias was his predecessor, and was appointed president of LawSoc in 1984.\nHe co-founded the Criminal Legal Aid scheme (CLAS) a year later, providing legal aid to those facing criminal charges but who could not afford lawyers. Pro bono work did not exist in Singapore in that form before this.\nSenior Counsel Vijayendran said Mr Elias was ""a Silk with exceptional persuasion, peroration and panache"".\nHe recalled watching Mr Elias persuade a judge in chambers almost 30 years ago when SC Vijayendran was a pupil.\n""That left a deep impression on me as the watching apprentice. It was pure poetry in motion,"" he said.\n""There is now a void in the Law Society with this sad loss of one of its finest gems. But his fingerprints will be everywhere notably in the civil litigation and criminal litigation Bars,"" said SC Vijayendran.\nMr Elias\' greatest legacy for LawSoc was that he ""gave\xa0justice to the weakest in society"", and his name will always be linked with CLAS, he added.\n""35 years on and going strong, CLAS, like its visionary architect, is pure class and now Singapore’s Office of Private Defender,"" said SC Vijayendran.\xa0\n""This Society and society (are)\xa0the richer for it. CLAS is the crown jewel of the Law Society only because SC Harry Elias had the acuity to see the value, and invest the hard work, in creating this gem of priceless value.""\nFellow veteran lawyer Peter Low told CNA that Mr Elias was his boss many years ago when he was a young lawyer in Drew & Napier.\n""He inspired me and another colleague ... to later be presidents of LawSoc,"" said Mr Low, adding that Mr Elias was ""highly ethical and very personable"".\nHe said Mr Elias was ""a brave lawyer"", standing up to Lee Kuan Yew at a select committee to defend the former senior district judge Michael Khoo, stating that Mr Khoo had a good track record as a judge.\nLawyer Doris Chia, who worked as a young lawyer in Mr Elias\' firm, said\xa0he taught her, among other things, ""integrity, professionalism, respect for the judiciary"" and ""to always put the client\'s interest before profit"".\n""His loud laughter and colourful stories about his cases will forever be missed,"" she added.\nCalling Mr Elias a ""legal giant"", lawyer Josephus Tan quoted Mr Nelson Mandela in describing the late lawyer, saying: ""A good head and a good heart are always a formidable combination.""\nCLAS would be ""his most enduring legacy for our legal fraternity and the underprivileged among us"", said Mr Tan.\nHe said the firm Mr Elias founded has produced ""many great legal personalities"" and is a leading firm that aspiring lawyers want to start their journeys with.\n""Back in 2006, I did my first and only internship at his firm under Mr Subhas Anandan, who went on to become my pupil master,"" he said.\xa0\n""In my early years of practice as a budding criminal lawyer handling many CLAS cases, I bumped into Mr Elias at a lunch and I remembered how he told me to keep doing what I do only to find out later that I just spoke to the legend who co-founded CLAS himself.\xa0It was a star-struck moment for me.""\nMr Elias, who was still doing pro bono work when he was 80, previously told CNA that his feelings about ensuring everyone gets their day in court had not changed, no matter how heinous the crime.\n""It’s not for us to try them. The whole system is that there is a judge,” Mr Elias had said. “If he thinks you have done wrong, listen (to my defence) and punish (accordingly).”\n“So why don\'t we take (the case), give them the opportunity for the best possible representation. Sometimes you take it on the basis of acquittal.

But he never failed to teach,"" she said.\n""Harry had a good heart and a zest for life, a wonderful enthusiasm that was both infectious and uplifting. He also had tremendous wit and a great sense of humour.""\nShe added: ""The profession is the poorer for his passing. But his contributions and influence live on – in the firms he led, the lawyers he mentored, the outcomes of the cases he fought, the work he did in the Law Society and the leadership he provided as a senior member of the Bar.""\nLaw Minister K Shanmugam said in a Facebook post that he first met Mr Elias in 1984 when he was a pupil, and they became friends over time.\n""Harry was a much sought after lawyer.

      Commentary: Why the New Zealand mosque gunman deserved an unprecedented sentence
  </h1>, 'text': 'HAMILTON: Was Brenton Tarrant’s\xa0silence\xa0and acceptance of sentence in court a final act to expand his notoriety? Was his\xa0disavowal\xa0of previously expressed ideological views a trick?\nA person capable of planning the Christchurch mosque attacks so methodically may well have mapped the last public chapter, too. By saying little and expressing no real remorse, alone and without even his own lawyer, was he hoping the world would see a determined stoicism, an enigma?\nOr did he simply realise the controls around court behaviour were so well designed that he couldn’t hijack proceedings?\nFor now at least, we can’t know.\xa0\nAll we can say for sure is what the court has heard over the days leading to today’s\xa0sentence\xa0of life in prison with no minimum parole: Using overwhelming firepower against defenceless civilians he took the lives of 51 men, women and children, injured many more and left even more bereft.\nANOTHER ON THE LIST\nHis silence notwithstanding, then, he is not an enigma.\nAs the first person in New Zealand to be convicted of terrorism, he comes from the same dark place that spawned the likes of\xa0Anders Breivik\xa0in Norway,\xa0Darren Osborne,\xa0who drove a truck into Muslim worshippers in London in 2017, and\xa0Dylann Roof, who attacked black parishioners in a South Carolina church in 2015.\nTarrant had even carved the names of Alexandre Bissonette, who attacked a mosque in Quebec in 2017, and\xa0Luca Traini, who attacked African migrants in Italy in 2018, on the magazines of his guns.\nSo now he joins that list of mass murderers, animated by a hatred of tolerance, equality and multicultural values, who came to believe indiscriminate violence against unarmed civilians was justified.\nUNPRECEDENTED SENTENCE\nIf this was America, he could have been sentenced to death or given a cumulative jail sentence of over 1,000 years.\nNeither option is available in New Zealand. There are many good reasons for having no death penalty, including in this case the denial of any aspirations to martyrdom.\nThe most\xa0extreme penalty\xa0New Zealand law does allow is jail for life without any minimum parole period.\nAlthough a sentence of 30 years without parole has been imposed, life without parole has never been given.\nIt is fair to say that Judge Cameron Mander, who did an excellent job throughout, met public expectation with his decision to ensure Tarrant never again walks outside a guarded wall.\nWHAT THE LAW DEMANDS\nSuch a sentence is justified if the court is satisfied no minimum term of imprisonment would be enough to satisfy the main considerations: Accountability, denouncement, deterrence or protecting the community.\nIn short, the Sentencing Act sets out the\xa0purposes of sentencing: To hold the offender to account for the harm done to the victims and the wider community, to denounce the crime and deter others from replicating those acts.\nSupplementary\xa0principles\xa0a sentencing judge must consider include the gravity of the offending and its seriousness compared to other types of offences.\nThe judge is required “to impose the maximum penalty prescribed for the offence if the offending is within the most serious of cases for which that penalty is prescribed” - unless there are mitigating circumstances.\nThe only\xa0mitigation\xa0that would have carried weight in this case was Tarrant\xa0pleading guilty\xa0and therefore shortening proceedings. Other mitigating factors, such as remorse or\xa0offers to make amends, were not to be seen or were deemed not genuine.\nPLACING VICTIMS FIRST\nThe other principle Judge Mander had to take into account relates to the effect of the offending on the victims.\nAs the 91\xa0victim impact statements\xa0heard over three days made clear, those victims displayed remarkable fortitude, bravery, wisdom and humanity. But the black hole of pain the killer left in his wake is near incomprehensible.\nFurther\xa0aggravating factors\xa0justifying this sentence were that these were pre-meditated crimes of hate, terrorism, particular cruelty and involved the use of weapons.\nTarrant ticked all of the boxes. The enormity of his crimes made them unlike anything that had gone before. New Zealand has experienced mass shootings in the past, and murders based on racial hatred, but nothing of this scale.\nOn top of that, no one had\xa0employed the internet\xa0to spread hatred as happened in Christchurch, nor has anyone pleaded guilty to an act of terrorism before.\nWhen all of these considerations were put on the scales of justice, Judge Mander would have seen that, small acts of mitigation aside, an unprecedented sentence was the only appropriate outcome for an unprecedented crime.\nAlexander Gillespie is Professor of Law at the University of Waikato.

  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Data security and trade in data have become a major bone of contention between the United States (US) and China in a conflict that started as a trade tussle but is rapidly sliding towards a new cold war.\xa0\nConcerns over access to data by the Chinese government has led the US to impose measures on companies that use US technologies to supply Huawei, a leading Chinese telecoms company.\xa0\nIt has also leaned on countries around the world to exclude Huawei from its 5G network for reasons of data security risks.\xa0\nIn August, the Trump Administration announced that for national security concerns, it would ban the popular video networking TikTok app.\xa0\nA similar move was announced for WeChat, the popular app that allows users to perform multiple tasks, from communications to ecommerce to payments.\xa0\nThe argument was that both apps could divert data of US citizens to the Chinese government.\xa0\xa0\nThe purge of the two apps was part of the US’ “Clean Network” initiative, which, according to statements by the US State Department, has already signed up more than 30 countries though these remain as of yet unidentified.\xa0\nDATA PROTECTION IS ON THE RISE\nChina itself tightly controls and censors its cyberspace through the Great Firewall, and has banned access of major US firms such as Twitter, Facebook and Google.\xa0\nIts 2017 Cybersecurity law raised concerns about the protection of personal data, as the law requires companies in China to hand over data if requested by the authorities.\xa0\xa0\nThe establishment of the Social Credit Schemes aimed at providing individuals with incentives for good behaviour, and which relies on large data collection efforts, has further raised concerns regarding the protection of personal data in China.\xa0\xa0\nThe EU Chamber of Commerce\xa0recently raised issues with China’s overall cybersecurity legal framework.\xa0 It therefore came as a bit of a surprise that on Sep 8 Foreign Minister Wang Yi announced an initiative to establish global standards on data security.\xa0\nWang Yi said that China wanted to promote multilateralism in the area at a time when individual countries were “bullying others and hunting companies”.\n“Global data security rules that reflect the wishes of all countries and respect the interests of all parties should be reached on the basis of universal participation by all parties,” Wang said.\xa0\nChina’s initiative calls for participating countries to refrain from large-scale surveillance of other countries or illegally acquire information of foreign citizens through information technology.\xa0\nIt also calls for technology firms to prevent the creation of so-called backdoors in their products and services that could allow data to be obtained illegally, as well as for participants to respect the sovereignty, jurisdiction and data management rights of other countries.\xa0\nWang Yi also said that China’s government “has not and will not require Chinese companies to provide overseas data to the Chinese government in violation of the laws of other countries,” thereby countering one of the biggest arguments the US and others have used to taint data handling by Chinese companies.\nWHY WE NEED INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS\nThere is a clear need to agree on international standards in data security.\xa0 Data is becoming increasingly important for economic activity, and China is at the forefront of the digital economy, most notably ecommerce and digital finance.\xa0\nAt the same time, there is growing demand, even in China, for protection of personal data and information.\xa0\nAnd there are growing concerns from governments how data, if in the wrong hands, could endanger national security. Even trickier is the movement of data across borders.\xa0 This is essential for modern trade in services and innovation in manufacturing, which relies on information from users.\xa0\nKeeping data strictly national or localised would impede trade and innovation.\xa0\nCountries around the world have taken legal or regulatory steps to protect personal data. On last count, about 140 countries have some form of law or regulation on data protection.\xa0\nThe EU’s General Data Protection Regulation is one of the better known, and strictest, frameworks - increasingly becoming a model for other countries to follow.\xa0 China enacted its cybersecurity law in 2018, which was skewed towards national security rather that personal data protection.\xa0\nSince then, though, the country has also made efforts on protecting personal information security and data security, and a draft Data Security Law was released for comments in July.\xa0 The first civil code in China, released in 2020, also specifies data privacy as a personal right.\nThe data security standards embedded in these laws vary considerable from country to country, as different societies have different attitudes on data protection vis-à-vis other societal goals such as development or community interest.\xa0\nThe debate on tracing apps to contain the COVID-19 pandemic illustrates this diverse attitude: Countries such as Singapore, Korea and China rapidly adopted or mandated tracing apps to easily find people that may have had contact with COVID-19 infected people.\nIn many European countries and in the US, such apps were seen to infringe on personal freedom and personal information, and they found much less widespread use.\xa0\nBILATERAL AGREEMENTS COULD BE COSTLY\nThe digital economy is transnational in nature, and allowing data transfers from one country to another can maximise the potential and minimise costs.\xa0\nAt the same time, transferring data from one country to another could undermine protections granted to data subjects under national law. Therefore, data protection regimes would normally include rules on data transfer to other countries.\xa0 Such rules can obviously have trade implications.\nThese regulations could be used to protect one’s own industry, and could become a barrier against international trade and investment. The WTO’s General Agreement in Trade in Services (GATS) contains some rules on data protection and data transfer, though these were largely formulated before the digital revolution took off in earnest.\nA new multilateral agreements on data security and transfer would therefore be highly desirable, but in today’s atmosphere seems further off than ever.\xa0\nBilateral trade agreements have started to fill the gap, and the recent Singapore-Australia Digital Economy Agreement is a case in point. It aims to set “new global benchmarks for trade rules, and a range of practical cooperation initiatives, to reduce barriers to digital trade.”\nAt the same time, a bilateral approach to the complex issues of data protection and data transferability risks a multitude of norms and standards across jurisdictions, which could create high compliance costs for business, especially small and medium enterprises.\nGETTING SUPPORT MAY BE TOUGH\nIt is in this context that China’s initiative proposes global standards on data security.\xa0\nSuch standards, once agreed on by a plurality of countries could guide individual countries in developing their own legal framework, and become a benchmark for bilateral or multilateral agreements on the topic.\xa0\nWang Yi had foreshadowed the initiative at an online G20 meeting the week before the announcement, as it seeks more support for the initiative particularly from G20 members.\xa0\nChina’s multilateral approach is going head to head with the US’ Clean Network Initiative.\xa0\nThe US initiative seems largely targeted at China: “The Clean Network program is the Trump Administration’s comprehensive approach to guarding our citizens’ privacy and our companies’ most sensitive information from aggressive intrusions by malign actors, such as the Chinese Communist Party (CCP),” a US State Department announcement on the initiative reads.\nThis August, the Internet Society, an industry group with members including Google, COMCAST, AT&T and Eriksson, sharply criticised the Clean Network Initiative.\xa0\n“Policies like these only increase the global momentum towards a “Splinternet” — a fractured network, rather than the Internet we have built over the last four decades and need now more than ever,” the society wrote in a statement on their website.\xa0\nIrrespective, little support for China’s initiative can be expected from the US at this point in time.\xa0 Other countries have yet to express their views, but it seems unlikely that all G20 members would agree to discuss China’s initiative at this stage.\xa0\nNevertheless, China’s initiative could entice other countries to develop their own proposals and principles that may be supported by a broad set of countries.\xa0 The superpowers could then decide whether they want to get on board with those principles in due course.\xa0\nBert Hofman is Director of the East Asian Institute at the National University of Singapore.\n', 'related_topics': ['     China ', '     US ', '     data ', '     technology ', '     law ']}"

      Judgment reserved in The Online Citizen, SDP's POFMA appeals, as court grapples with legal issues including burden of proof
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The Court of Appeal reserved judgment on Thursday (Sep 17) on two appeals by the Singapore Democratic Party and The Online Citizen (TOC) against correction orders issued\xa0under the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA).\nThe SDP is accused of making false statements about unemployment in Singapore, while TOC is alleged to have made a\xa0false statement about hanging methods at Changi Prison.\nAmong the questions the court grappled with in a full-day hearing on Thursday included the burden of proof in such cases, and if the statements were indeed false.\nChief Justice Sundaresh Menon and Judges of Appeal Andrew Phang, Judith Prakash, Tay Yong Kwang and Steven Chong ordered all parties to file supplementary arguments on a\xa0point on whether POFMA restricts one\'s constitutional right of free speech. The judges will decide at a later date if another hearing is necessary.\nThe cases are separate but were heard together. Both TOC and SDP\xa0appealed to have the correction directions issued to them dismissed, but failed in their first bids in the High Court.\nTOC was issued a correction direction by the Minister of Home Affairs on Jan 22 for an article it published based on a press statement by Malaysian non-governmental organisation Lawyers for Liberty (LFL), which alleged that illegal hanging methods were used in Singapore\'s Changi Prison.\nMHA refuted the allegations as ""untrue, baseless and preposterous"", and said any acts as those described in the article would have been thoroughly investigated and dealt with.\nSDP received three correction directions from the Ministry of Manpower in December 2019 for three posts: An online article published in June 2019 titled SDP Population Policy: Hire S\'poreans First, Retrench S\'poreans Last; a Facebook post in November 2019 linking to the above article; and a Facebook advertisement in December 2019 containing a link to the article and a graph with a downward-pointing arrow titled Local PMET Employment.\nMOM said that SDP\'s graph showing plunging employment of local professionals, managers, executives and technicians (PMETs) was false, giving statistics to show that local PMETs employment has risen steadily since 2015.\nIt also said SDP\'s statement that its proposal comes ""amidst a rising proportion of Singaporean PMETs getting retrenched"" was also false.\nWHO BEARS THE BURDEN OF PROOF?\nLawyer Suresh Nair, instructing counsel for the SDP\'s case, argued that the burden of proof lay on the minister issuing the correction direction, or on the Attorney-General\'s Chambers (AGC), to prove that the statement is false.\nThe High Court judges who dismissed both the SDP and TOC\'s earlier appeals were split on this issue - with Justice Ang Cheng Hock ruling that the minister bears the burden of proof in the SDP\'s case, and Justice Belinda Ang finding that TOC, or the statement maker, bears the burden of proof.\nThe AGC’s representatives maintained that the burden fell on the statement makers, saying that this was not ""an overly onerous burden"".\xa0\n""In other words, one should not assert statements of fact which affect the public interest if one does not have any evidence that it is true. This is the essence of responsible free speech,"" said Ms Kristy Tan, Mr Fu Qijing and Ms Amanda Sum.\nMr Nair highlighted ""the extraordinary nature of this piece of legislation"", saying that the mechanism of POFMA ""amounts to a false confession"", as the minister requires the other party to post a correction notice in terms defined by the minister.\n""The correction notice issued in (SDP\'s) case … doesn\'t say the minister says that what the SDP … has said is false and that the minister says that these alternative facts are true,” Mr Nair said.\n“It requires the SDP to specifically say - the SDP has made a false statement, and for the truth, go to the link, and there\'s a link to a Factually website.”\nIf the AG\'s arguments backing the correction directions are correct, then several consequences follow, said Mr Nair.\xa0\nFirstly, a correction direction can be made for not only what a person says, but also what a minister claims the person has said.\nSecondly, the minister can change what he or she claims the person has said as the case goes along. The minister is not held strictly by the original statement in the correction direction, said Mr Nair.\nThirdly, in order to set aside the correction direction, the statement maker must prove that what the minister claimed the statement maker said is true, even if this was not what the statement maker meant.\nChief Justice Menon said he wondered if it was possible to take a step back to ask what the case was about, instead of focusing on whether the burden of proof fell on the statement maker or the minister.\n""I don\'t think it\'s correct that the minister has to prove each and every (thing),"" he said.\xa0\n""For example, if a statement says the minister has got billions of dollars stashed away in his account, if the minister issues a correction direction saying this is untrue, and the statement maker says, ‘you prove it’.\n“It can\'t be right that the minister has to show all of his bank accounts in order to justify the issuance of the correction direction.""\nIn response, Mr Nair said to have the burden lie on the statement maker to prove the truth of what he said will be ""impossible"" in many cases, in the absence of a freedom of information legislation.\nWithout this, people will have to depend on what they hear, as they will not be able to get documents supporting their statements.\n""One wonders what wrongdoings of state would have gone unreported in a POFMA environment,"" said Mr Nair.\n""For example, in China we now know that a doctor raised an issue of this virus that was passed around. In a POFMA environment, would the public have come to know about this? One wonders if Watergate would have come to public knowledge in a POFMA environment. Not possible to prove.""\nHe said the court should consider if it was consistent with the constitutional right to freedom of speech to place the burden of proof on the appellant, even when the evidence ""is simply not available to him"".\nPOFMA, TOC AND JOURNALISM\nTOC\'s lawyer Mr Eugene Thuraisingam said that the article that was given a correction direction was ""genuine reporting"" of an allegation. The article contained a statement that said TOC had contacted MHA for its response.\nChief Justice Menon asked if publishing the correction direction would have the same effect as adding a response from MHA saying that the allegations of brutal prison treatment were untrue.\nMr Thuraisingam responded that it was not the same, as there are consequences to a correction direction being issued. A website that has three correction directions within six months can be made a Declared Online Location and face possible sanctions.\nHe said the Government proceeds with a correction direction under POFMA assuming that the author thinks the statement in the article is true, but TOC\'s position is that they never said it was true, but it had asked the Government if it was so.\nIf allowed to go down this route, Mr Thuraisingam said, reporters are placed in ""a very difficult position"".\nAGC\'s representative Hui Choon Kuen said in response that the relevant section of POFMA is targeted at statements and not the article’s author.\nA person can have genuine intentions in making a statement, but if it is a false statement affecting public interest, then POFMA can be used to neutralise the false statement’s effects, said Mr Hui.\n""My concern with this approach is that it imposes quite a burden on responsible journalism,"" said the chief justice.\n""I mean a journalist who gets wind of a fact that someone has made an allegation ... Just take for example someone says there\'s an allegation against a Government agent in the course of carrying out some work.\n“Somebody has made that allegation, and say that it\'s an allegation that has to be or is going to be investigated.\n“It worries me that you are saying that POFMA allows us to effectively go to a journalist and say, ‘you can\'t report that, or you can report that but you must report that and say it is untrue’.""\nChief Justice Menon said that if a media outlet receives a whistleblowing complaint, no one knows if the whistle was blown for good reason or not, but it is a matter of public interest.\n""Singaporeans have a right to know, and they have a right to know that a whistle has been blown,"" he said, explaining Mr Thuraisingam\'s point.\n""And we are not saying that we agree with the whistleblower, we are not saying it is true, but we are saying this is what they say - they are just reporting the debate.""\nMr Hui said there were different scenarios.\nHe gave the hypothetical scenario\xa0of an article that was published based on a whistleblower’s account that Singapore’s water supply had been tainted, causing panic.\nIf the news outlet said it had contacted the ministry in charge but it did not get a response by press time, it would not help in an appeal against a POFMA correction direction, said Mr Hui.\nJustice Prakash said that this was the nature of journalism, and that if the water was truly not poisoned, the Government ""would be out there saying immediately - no such thing"".\nChief Justice Menon added that he was concerned by the AGC\'s arguments about this, as it would seem that there would be ""a whole slew of things the media can\'t report"".\nIn response, Mr Hui said that if a responsible journalist reports on something of public interest, they should make attempts to verify.\n""And if at the end of the day, you do commit that false statement, and a correction direction is issued, it\'s not an indictment of the person,"" he said.\nThe chief justice asked: ""But you do agree that three strikes, three times you do this, you can end up being declared a declared site, and that would affect their whole standing as a journalistic website?""\nMr Hui responded that the point of that section in the Act was to counter those who make money out of purveying falsehoods. It is at the minister\'s discretion to make a site a declared online location.\nThe judges reserved judgment after about six hours of arguments. A verdict will be released at a later date. So far, no one has successfully overturned a correction direction issued under POFMA.\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     POFMA ', '     law ', '     The Online Citizen ', '     Singapore Democratic Party ']}"

      Hong Kong gay couples win legal victory over inheritance law

      Court of Appeal orders further arguments in case of drug trafficker on death row, execution on hold
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The Court of Appeal on Tuesday (Sep 22)\xa0called for further submissions to be made in the case of a convicted drug trafficker who was to hang last Friday, and put the execution of his death penalty on hold until further notice.\xa0\nDuring the hearing, defence lawyer M Ravi made allegations about a breach of\xa0client-solicitor privilege, saying that the Singapore Prison Service (SPS) had given\xa0private letters from his client\xa0to the Attorney-General\'s Chambers (AGC).\nThe ""breach"" was raised by\xa0human rights coalition Community Action Network in a statement on Monday.\xa0\nMr Ravi also claimed that there was prejudice as his client was lined up to hang before foreigners due to reasons related to COVID-19.\xa0\nIn addition, he\xa0alleged that ""in essence, no clemencies have been given"" in 22 years, suggesting that it was ""perfunctorily considered"".\nDeputy Chief Prosecutor Francis Ng slammed the allegations against the President, saying they were ""of a most serious and scandalous nature"" being used to denigrate the head of state. He called Mr Ravi\'s applications ""frivolous and vexatious"".\nAfter hearing arguments from both sides, Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon, along with appeal judges Judith Prakash and Andrew Phang, ordered parties to file submissions on three points.\nFirst, whether a prisoner awaiting capital punishment has a legitimate expectation that the date on which his punishment is carried out will not result in his being treated differently from other prisoners who are similarly situated.\nSecond, does the answer to the first question differ if prisoners who are Singaporean are treated differently from those who are not citizens, and third - if there are considerations in respect of the second question that could justify differential treatment. This is in relation to article 12 of the Singapore Constitution, which guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of the law to all persons.\nTHE CASE\nSingaporean Syed Suhail Syed Zin, 44, was arrested in 2011 and convicted in December 2015 of a capital charge of possessing at least 38.8g of diamorphine or heroin for trafficking.\nThe Court of Appeal dismissed his appeal in October 2018.\nHe was set to hang on Sep 18, but the execution was stayed at the last minute after his lawyer stepped in.\nMr Ravi sought a review of the court\'s decision in 2018 to uphold Syed\'s conviction and sentence on two grounds: That the issue of whether Syed suffered from an abnormality of mind was not sufficiently canvassed before, and that Syed\'s previous trial lawyer had failed to use available evidence to show that Syed had received an inheritance from his uncle. This would have rebutted the prosecution\'s argument that Syed could not have bought all the drugs for his own consumption.\nSyed\'s defence at trial and in the previous appeal had been that the drugs were for his own consumption, an argument earlier rejected by the court.\nSyed interrupted proceedings on Tuesday and said: ""You talk about fairness. What I actually want - me and 50-over guys in the gallows - what we want is mercy. We feel that we can make a difference, given a chance.""\nChief Justice Menon told him that the court would engage his counsel instead.\xa0\nTHE LETTERS READ BY AGC\nMr Ravi began his arguments on Tuesday with a point separate from his actual appeal, by saying he wanted the entire AGC team to be disqualified as it\xa0had read privileged communications by Syed to his then-lawyer and to his uncle.\xa0\nThe letters had purportedly been sent to AGC by the prison, according to\xa0Community Action Network, which\xa0called it a breach that is ""deeply alarming"".\nIn response, Deputy Chief Prosecutor Francis Ng said that the AGC ""came into possession of the letters"" in the course of preparing documents related to the discharge of Syed\'s then-lawyer Ramesh Tiwary.\n""The letters were not used in AGC\'s response,"" said Senior Counsel Ng, adding that he had not personally seen any of the letters.\nMr Ravi said that Senior Counsel Ng should be disqualified, arguing for a new counsel not associated with AGC\xa0to be appointed for the case\xa0""for the appearance of fairness"".\nJustice Phang repeatedly stopped Mr Ravi, who spoke over him several times in the hearing, telling him that he could not make ""broad sweeping statements"" without basis.\nHe asked Mr Ravi to explain why his client had been prejudiced by the reading of the letters, to which Mr Ravi said it was not the content itself but the fact that the documents were privileged and confidential.\nAt one point, the chief justice stepped in and told Mr Ravi not to interrupt or be rude, reminding him to observe decorum.\nJustice Phang interjected while Mr Ravi read from a judgment in the case of Gobi Avedian and Datchinamurthy Kataiah, telling him that he was the one who wrote that judgment.\nMr Ravi quoted from one part of the judgment, saying that if AGC wished to obtain copies of letters belonging to a prisoner, the proper procedure would have been to obtain the prisoner\'s consent or an order of court.\nJustice Phang pointed him instead to another part of his judgment, which read: ""By virtue of the AGC\'s role as legal adviser to the SPS, it may have access to information that other counsel might not, and it must therefore exercise due caution to avoid the possibility that it seeks an undue advantage.""\nIn the cited case, it was conceded that it was an oversight, and not an attempt by AGC to seek an advantage in the proceedings.\n""Therefore, if you want to apply (this case), you need to show what prejudice and what advantage was gained by the prosecution on the facts of this case, because it\'s not every breach that will result in an advantage,"" said Justice Phang.\nHe had difficulty with Mr Ravi\'s arguments, telling him that they made ""no logical sense at all"" and were a non sequitur.\nCLEMENCY IN DEATH PENALTY CASES, AND COVID-19\nMr Ravi then argued extensively about clemency and death penalties, alleging that in 22 years, there has been no clemency granted to prisoners on death row, suggesting that clemency was not considered properly.\nIn response, Chief Justice Menon said that his ""eloquent choice of words isn\'t going to make up for the lack of principles"", while Justice Phang said that just because no clemency was granted\xa0did not mean that it was not considered properly.\nHe gave a hypothetical example\xa0where no one received first-class honours in law school in 100 years.\n""Does it mean the grading is unfair? It\'s just that the candidates were not good enough. Of course, the candidates don\'t like it. Are they not smart enough? There may be unhappiness. No doubt you are entitled to your views. You are unhappy. But that\'s not the point. The point is due process.""\nMr Ravi responded that a law examination could not be compared with a man\'s life.\nHe also alleged that because of COVID-19, Singaporean prisoners might be executed over foreign prisoners, as foreign prisoners do not have access to family members and there may be issues in repatriating their mortal remains to their families abroad.\nAGC SLAMS LAWYER\'S CASE\nSenior Counsel Ng stated in his written arguments that SPS carries out execution of sentences pursuant to a judicial warrant issued under the seal of the Supreme Court.\nThis is after the court receives a presidential order containing the details of the time and place for the sentence to be carried out, which is in turn made by the president after receiving advice from the Cabinet.\nSenior Counsel Ng added that an execution is ""a solemn and natural consequence of the law taking its course"". He cited a Court of Appeal judgment that said an offender sentenced to death ""has effectively already been deprived of his life by the law due to this conviction for a capital offence"" and that in the absence of clemency, ""his life will be forfeited as decreed by the law"".\nHe said that all of Mr Ravi\'s grounds, old and new, ""are legally incoherent, unsupported by any evidence and smack of a blunderbuss approach towards trying to seek leave by raising illogical arguments"".\nHe said this is precisely that type of ""groundless or hopeless case"" that the Rules of Court was meant to filter out.\n""While the appellant faces the most severe punishment under Singapore’s laws, this is not carte blanche for him and his counsel to put forward all manner of baseless assertions impugning the conduct of public office holders and use judicial review as a tool to dam the flow of justice,"" said Senior Counsel Ng.\nCNA has contacted SPS and AGC for more information.\n', 'related_topics': ['     crime ', '     law ']}"

      Man paid hacker RuneScape in-game currency to access email accounts related to ex-girlfriend, gets probation
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: A 20-year-old man offered an acquaintance\xa0on online game RuneScape in-game currency to help him hack into email accounts belonging to men linked to his ex-girlfriend, later threatening one of the victims with a screenshot of his hacked account.\nFor two counts of instigating another person to secure unauthorised access to computer material and one count of intentionally causing alarm by sending threatening communications, Lee See Hao was sentenced on Tuesday (Sep 22) to a year\'s probation.\nAnother four charges were taken into consideration.\nLee, who is now 24, also has to perform 50 hours of community service and stay with his mother during the period of probation. His mother furnished a bond of S$5,000 to ensure his good behaviour.\nThe court heard that Lee\'s ex-girlfriend had given him access to her email account when they were together. When they broke up in 2016, the ex-girlfriend sought a friend\'s help to change her email security settings as she did not want Lee to access her account any further.\nWhen Lee could not access the account, he realised that the victim, a 23-year-old man, had helped his ex-girlfriend change her security settings.\nOn Sep 10, 2016, Lee sent messages to a Skype user he knew as Jake, and whom he had met in the online computer game RuneScape.\nAs Lee had heard that Jake could hack into online accounts, he offered Jake 60 million coins in RuneScape to help him hack the victim\'s account.\nJake agreed and accessed the victim\'s email account, taking two screenshots of his inbox and sending them to Lee.\nLee sent the screenshots to the victim, threatening him: ""I can empty your bank account so ****ing easily"", and saying: ""I promise you I won\'t do anything, unless you step out of line.""\nThe victim was alarmed and changed his email password and security settings before making a police report.\nLater that month in September 2016, Lee discovered that his ex-girlfriend had begun dating a 21-year-old man.\nHe grew angry and contacted Jake again, offering him another 60 million RuneScape coins to get the new man\'s email password.\nJake agreed and hacked into the second victim\'s email account\xa0and gave Lee\xa0the password.\nLee used the information in the email account to access the victim\'s social media accounts on Facebook and Instagram, before resetting the Facebook password and deleting the Instagram account.\nWhen the victim realised what happened, he made a police report. He suspected\xa0Lee was the culprit as Lee had previously expressed his unhappiness about the victim\'s relationship with Lee\'s ex-girlfriend.\nLee was later identified and his devices seized. He said Jake is not from Singapore and does not know how to locate him.\nLAWYER ASKS FOR PROBATION\nLee\'s lawyer, Jonathan Lim from Dentons Rodyk & Davidson, asked for probation for his client, saying that rehabilitation was the dominant consideration.\nHe said four years has lapsed since the offences, and Lee has since steered clear of trouble and moved on with life productively, completing his national service and enrolling in the Singapore University of Social Sciences.\nHe is also working part-time as a food delivery rider to generate income, and lives alone with his mother who is divorced. The family is not financially well-off, and Lee was 20 at the time of the offences and is considered a young offender, said Mr Lim.\nHe said Lee had contacted the second victim online before the offences, and the second victim had allegedly taunted Lee, saying ""she is mine now"", referring to Lee\'s ex-girlfriend.\n""Any imprisonment, high fine, and criminal record for a young offender like See Hao’s could potentially derail his future plans and career,"" said Mr Lim.\xa0\n""His ability to be a useful, productive and responsible member of society should not be short-circuited because of fleeting lapses of judgment. The defence also highlights that \'the public have no greater interest than that he should become a good citizen. The difficult task of the court is to determine what treatment gives the best chance of realising that object\',"" he said, citing from a previous judgment.\nFor his computer crimes, Lee could have been jailed for up to two years, fined up to S$5,000, or both.\n', 'related_topics': ['     crime ', '     law ']}"

  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on Tuesday (Sep 22) said there was “no legal prohibition” in 2018 against the Singapore Prisons Service (SPS) extending letters written by a convicted drug trafficker to the Attorney-General’s Chambers (AGC).\nDefence lawyer M Ravi alleged during a hearing on Tuesday\xa0that SPS had breached client-solicitor privilege by giving private letters from Syed Suhail Syed Zin, who was convicted in 2015, to the AGC.\nHe was set to hang on Sep 18 this year, but the execution was stayed at the last minute after intervention from his lawyer.\nThe “breach” was raised by human rights coalition Community Action Network in a statement on Monday.\nIn a statement, MHA laid out the circumstances surrounding the incident.\nIt said that during a hearing before the Court of Appeal on May 3, 2018, Syed Suhail informed the Court that he wished to introduce evidence from his uncle for the purposes of the appeal, having given the Court various reasons during the trial for not calling his uncle as a defence witness.\nMHA added that the hearing was then adjourned for parties to look into this request and the Court of Appeal allowed the AGC to file a response if it thought that Syed Suhail was abusing the process of the Court.\nMHA said in\xa0the preparation of its response, AGC approached SPS to check whether Syed Suhail had expressed any prior intention to call his uncle as a witness. SPS’s\xa0checks revealed that Syed Suhail had informed the Superintendent of his intention to call his uncle as a defence witness. He had also written four letters to his uncle.\xa0\n“In this context, SPS extended a copy of these letters, and one letter to his then-counsel (i.e. the Letter) to the AGC on May 10, 2018 and Jun 7, 2018,” the ministry said. “At that time, there was no legal prohibition in the Prisons Act or Regulations against doing so.”\nALLEGATIONS OF DISCRIMINATION 'BASELESS': MHA\nMHA also denied allegations\xa0of discrimination or impropriety in the scheduling of judicial executions.\nLawyer\xa0M Ravi said that there was prejudice as his client was lined up to hang before foreigners due to reasons related to COVID-19.\xa0\nSyed Suhail had filed an application to the High Court for permission to commence judicial review proceedings against the Singapore Prison Service (SPS), to stay the execution of his sentence.\nHe alleged that\xa0the order for judicial execution violates his Constitutional right to equal treatment under Article 12, as differential treatment has been applied between foreigners and Singaporeans in the scheduling of his judicial execution.\nSyed Suhail's\xa0application was dismissed by Justice See Kee Oon on Sep 17, and the appeal was heard by the Court of Appeal on Tuesday. Parties have been directed to file further submissions, and will return to the Court of Appeal on a date to be fixed after Oct 6.\n“All prisoners sentenced to capital punishment are accorded due process according to the law,” the ministry said in its statement.\n“A judicial execution will only be scheduled after an inmate has exhausted all legal channels for appeal and clemency, regardless of whether the prisoner is a Singaporean or a foreigner.”\nThe ministry added that four judicial executions were carried out in 2019, involving two Singaporeans and two foreigners.\n“Such allegations are baseless and will be comprehensively addressed in MHA’s response which will be filed before the next hearing date.”\nThe ministry said it is unable to give further comments as the matter is currently before the Courts.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     crime ', '     law ']}"

      Parti Liyani files court action to seek disciplinary proceedings against prosecutors in her case
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Ms Parti Liyani, the former domestic helper of businessman Liew Mun Leong, has taken to court to seek disciplinary proceedings against the prosecutors in her case.\nIf she is successful, proceedings could be initiated to assess if there was any misconduct by the prosecutors.\nMs Parti\'s lawyer, Mr Anil Balchandani, attended a pre-trial conference in the High Court on Wednesday (Sep 23) against representatives from the Attorney-General\'s Chambers (AGC).\nThe hearing was for an originating summons under Section 82A of the Legal Profession Act, for disciplinary proceedings against legal service officers.\nThe respondents listed in Ms Parti\'s case are two deputy public prosecutors who dealt with her trial: Mr Tan Wee Hao, and Ms Tan Yanying. They are represented by AGC\'s Kristy Tan Ruyan, Jeyendran Jeyapal and Jocelyn Teo Meng Hui.\xa0\nAn originating summons is a way to begin civil action and is based on affidavits filed to support the case. It is heard before registrars or judges.\nIf the Chief Justice grants Ms Parti leave for an investigation to be made into the complaint of misconduct, he may appoint a disciplinary tribunal. The tribunal will then hear the case and investigate the complaint, before submitting its findings to the Chief Justice. He can dismiss the complaint if the tribunal finds no cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action, or give orders to have punishments imposed.\nSection 82A is concerned with misconduct by legal service officers or non-practising solicitors. If due cause is shown with proof that the legal service officer is guilty of misconduct befitting their post as an advocate and solicitor, they could be punished.\nPenalties include censures, being struck off the roll, penalty of up to S$20,000, or any other order a disciplinary tribunal deems fit.\nWhen approached by CNA, Mr Balchandani confirmed that the hearing took place on Wednesday but declined comment.\nMs Parti was acquitted earlier this month by the High Court of stealing S$34,000 worth of items from former Changi Airport Group chairman Liew Mun Leong.\nThis came after she was convicted in a lower court. In Justice Chan Seng Onn\'s judgment on her acquittal, he outlined several issues with the conviction findings and how the case was handled.\nHe noted the prosecution\'s use of a faulty DVD player in the hearing, saying that the fact that it was faulty was not disclosed to the trial judge nor to Ms Parti. If the prosecutor had known of the defect, they should have fully disclosed it, said Justice Chan.\nIf not, the trial court could be misled into thinking that the Pioneer DVD player was in good working condition when ""questions were (and unfairly) put to Ms Parti ... on the basis that the DVD player was still in a good working condition after an incomplete demonstration of its important functionalities during the trial"", he said.\nIn his judgment, he said the rule against introducing evidence from the bar should apply equally to both the prosecution and defence, and said the DVD player incident was ""particularly prejudicial to Ms Parti"" as she was not given a chance to test the player until the trial itself.\nA week after the acquittal, Mr Liew announced he was retiring from his public service and business roles with Changi Airport Group, Surbana Jurong, Temasek Foundation and Temasek International.\nCNA has contacted AGC for more information.\n', 'related_topics': ['     law ', '     Parti Liyani ']}"

      The lawyers doing pro bono work helping migrant workers get 'equal access to justice'
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: A few months ago, Raj’s* life in Singapore was turned upside down.\xa0\nThe 44-year-old migrant worker from India, who has worked here for more than\xa012 years, had been looking for a job during the COVID-19 pandemic. He found an employment agent who put out an advertisement on Facebook for a position that promised a monthly salary of about S$1,000.\nIt turned out to be a scam.\nThe agent handed him\xa0a fraudulent in-principle approval\xa0(IPA) for a work permit. Meanwhile, it filed for a work permit without the required written authorisation from Raj – and with a different employer from the one stated on the fake IPA. The salary was less than half of what was promised.\nWhen Raj asked for the unauthorised work permit to be cancelled -\xa0as he had, in the meantime, found another job on his own -\xa0the employment agent\xa0refused to do so. The agent insisted that\xa0Raj hand over a large sum of money and take the job at a lower pay instead.\xa0\nRaj filed a police report and a complaint to the Ministry of Manpower (MOM).\nBut there was a limit to how long he could stay in Singapore while waiting for the case to be resolved, with the validity of his Special Pass coming to an end. The pass is issued to workers who\xa0became unemployed during the dormitory lockdowns and could not be sent home during the confinement period.\nHe sought help from migrant worker advocacy group ItsRainingRaincoats (IRR), which roped in international law firm Morrison & Foerster.\nRaj’s case is one of several that the firm has been involved in, on a pro bono basis.\nWhile lawyers at international firms here are not allowed to give legal advice on Singapore law or represent workers in court, they can help to make sense of their plight.\nFor Ms Tessa Davis, one of the lawyers in Raj\'s case, her work typically involves talking to workers to get the facts and timeline laid out, digging for more information that would help the worker’s case, documenting all the evidence if the case goes to court, or talking and writing to employers and employment\xa0agencies to sort out the worker’s situation.\n“The idea is to try and get involved at an early-stage … so it’s not legal assistance that we’re giving but just maybe helping tip the scales back in their favour a bit,” Ms Davis told CNA.\nIn Raj’s case, lawyers spoke to the employment agent and the construction company but neither party budged.\nThey also helped him print the necessary documents needed to explain his case to MOM.\nA\xa0ministry officer told Raj that he had to hand-deliver a letter to the unauthorised employer confirming he did not want the contract, so the lawyers drafted a resignation letter for him and got an office manager to drive him to their office to print it.\xa0\nThe office manager accompanied him to the construction company’s office the next morning to drop off the letter, then\xa0waited together for a few hours at the door to prove that the office was closed, before taking a picture as evidence that he\xa0had delivered the letter when he slid the signed notice under the company’s door.\nAfter all that work, Raj was told that the fraudulent application would be cancelled. His permit to remain in Singapore would be extended and he could accept the new position with his new employer.\n“I am … grateful to have the fake work permit issue resolved and the opportunity to start again with a new employer. I will remember for a lifetime the help that Tessa and her team has given to me,"" Raj said.\xa0\nHis real name was not used in this report due to the sensitivity of his case.\nEach case\xa0takes between 12 and\xa020 hours, said Ms Davis, and they mostly involve recovering wages from employers,\xa0unjust practices by employment agencies, or getting employers to write transfer letters allowing workers to switch\xa0jobs instead of repatriating them.\nMost of these workers don’t have a strong command of the English language or documentation, so it is often very difficult for them to recount what has happened in clear terms, Ms Davis said.\nThis could affect the outcome if they had to explain their request to MOM representatives, or the parties they are up against.\nOften, the employer or employment agency pays up or hands over a transfer letter after lawyers get involved, Ms Davis said.\xa0\nIn cases that require formal legal advice, Ms Davis ropes in local firm TSMP Law Corporation, which has experience doing pro bono work for migrant worker rights groups like HOME and TWC2.\n“When you need a lawyer to give Singapore legal advice or to fight in court, that’s when we need to get rustled up,” said Stefanie Yuen-Thio, the managing partner of TSMP.\xa0\nWORKING WITH NGOS\nMore lawyers are getting involved in pro bono work.\nIt has been about three months since Ms Davis got involved in cases through IRR. Since then, her team dealing with such cases has grown from three to nine.\nShe said several of Morrison\xa0& Foerster\'s clients - who each have their own in-house legal teams - recently asked how they can get involved as well.\nMs Davis was approached by IRR founder Dipa Swaminathan around the end of May.\nThe organisation was, at that time, “inundated with requests” over workers’ grievances due to uncertainties over COVID-19 and the dormitory lockdowns, said Ms Davis.\nMs Swaminathan’s team manages the first level of cases that come in. About 90 per cent of them are resolved by IRR volunteers, some of whom are lawyers as well.\nThere is “no magic formula” in choosing which cases are sent to Ms Davis’ team, Ms\xa0Swaminathan said, but they tend to be more serious ones.\n“The worker is kind of vulnerable. And some employers might think that workers don’t have a circle of well-wishers around them to come to the worker’s aid in times of distress. This makes the worker even easier to be taken advantage of,” Ms\xa0Swaminathan said.\nJust having somebody write a clear and persuasive letter in a formal language to the employer, state facts in an objective and detailed manner to the authorities, or provide the worker with the assurance that there are lawyers overseeing their situation is\xa0extremely helpful, she added.\xa0\n“I think it’s wonderful,” said Ms Swaminathan, commending the work of the lawyers.\n“People are coming forward to give up their time in their personal capacity to speak up for these workers …. giving a voice to the voiceless. And when that voice comes from a legally trained person, it becomes a very powerful voice,” she added.\xa0\nLawyers from K&L Gates Straits Law, as well as legal counsels from Facebook and Singtel recently volunteered to help IRR in their personal capacity, she highlighted.\xa0\nMs Yuen-Thio said it is rare for an international law firm in Singapore to be so deeply drawn into such pro bono work\xa0which is more demanding on time as the lawyer could have to “drop everything” to help a worker who only has a few hours to\xa0get his issue solved.\n“I’ve done a lot of pro bono work, but the emotional investment in reviewing contracts or serving on the board of an NGO is a lot less than when you have someone’s life, livelihood and the wellbeing of his family back home at stake,” she said.\nACCESS TO JUSTICE\nMs Davis dismissed suggestions that lawyers doing pro bono work take their role more lightly compared to paid work.\xa0\nLawyers who work on a pro bono basis for foreign workers came into the spotlight recently after Mr Anil Balchandani secured a\xa0successful acquittal\xa0for\xa0former domestic helper Parti Liyani. Ms Parti was accused of stealing from her then-employer, former Changi Airport Group chairman Liew Mun Leong.\nMr Balchandani won praise\xa0for his dedication and hard work as her defence counsel. The judge who\xa0delivered the acquittal,\xa0Justice Chan Seng Onn, also commended him on his pro bono services.\n“When a firm gets involved in a case on a pro bono basis … they are a hundred per cent committed to the importance of pro bono and providing the same level of service that they would for a paying client,” Ms Davis said.\xa0\xa0\n“And in many cases, that assistance goes above and beyond that standard,” she added, referring to the office manager who spent hours sitting with Raj outside the construction company\'s office to make sure she captured the necessary proof.\n“Somebody’s life is going to be impacted here and so, the lawyers that are volunteering to do this, they want to be involved, they want to make a difference - so they’re just so keenly happy to be involved in a case where they can do that,” she added.\xa0\n“The whole ‘equal access to justice’ idea\xa0-\xa0I know it sounds high-minded, but it is the thing that really motivates us:\xa0That somebody risks being deprived of access to justice, just because of their socio-economic status,” said Ms Davis.\n“(These) are things that lawyers are supposed to care about because, as lawyers, we can play a pivotal role in helping to provide\xa0that access to justice.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     COVID-19 ', '     law ', '     migrant workers ']}"

      More couples seek counselling as circuit breaker, working from home put strain on marriages
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: After months of fighting and added stress at home, Jack and Rose*\xa0considered getting a divorce due to “deep levels of hurt” resulting from tensions during\xa0the COVID-19 “circuit breaker” period.\xa0\xa0\nWith everyone at home, there were more chores and cleaning up to do. As schools were closed, they also had to supervise their seven-year-old child doing home-based learning.\nSpeaking to CNA about the couple’s experience, chief wellbeing officer of the Singapore Counselling Centre (SCC) John Shepherd Lim said: “The wife, being the main caregiver, was highly stressed out and was frustrated at the fact that her husband was not helping around the house despite his presence at home.”\xa0\nThis is a “very typical situation” for families during the circuit breaker period, Mr Lim noted, adding that the “levels of hurt” and “extent of relational strain” in the\xa0case of Jack and Rose were\xa0due to the tone and abrasiveness when the couple communicated with each other.\xa0\nThe real names of the couple were not given because of confidentiality issues.\n“The wife accused her husband of being useless\xa0and nonchalant, causing the husband to feel unvalidated as he worked hard to feed the family; the husband accused his wife of being noisy\xa0and irritating, causing the wife to feel all the more upset as her feelings were not understood,” said Mr Lim.\nThe couple\xa0are not the only ones seeing tensions at home escalate after extended periods of staying home and working from home together. Therapists and counsellors CNA spoke to saw an increase in the number of couples and individuals approaching them because of relationship problems.\xa0\nCHALLENGES ADJUSTING TO NEW ROUTINES\nAlliance Counselling saw about 30 to 40 per cent more couples and individuals over the past six months, said counsellor Martine Hill.\xa0\nWorking from home together puts more strain on couples because their daily routines have been disrupted\xa0and they find it challenging to adjust to the changes, said Ms Hill.\xa0\n“They haven\'t learned how to set appropriate boundaries around who is doing what. How are they going to split their time? Who gets the computer? And in some ways there are many factors that can be influencing them, particularly the actual confinement of space,” she added.\xa0\nWith the COVID-19 pandemic, life as they knew it has disappeared, and many people were not able to explain what they were experiencing, said Ms Hill.\xa0\n“They knew that they were so tired. They knew that they were feeling sluggish, but weren\'t able to put into words what they were experiencing ...\xa0Therefore, they’re often more irritable or less patient with people around them, but they weren\'t able to communicate,” she added.\xa0\n“So it was kind of like - why are we getting into these arguments? Why are we getting into big fights? Why am I so irritable? Why is everybody driving me crazy?”\xa0\nLESS PERSONAL SPACE, BLURRED BOUNDARIES\nAt SCC, Mr Lim\xa0saw a 20 per cent increase in the number of couples going for counselling sessions over the past six months\xa0compared to earlier this year.\xa0\nDecreased personal space is a “major stressor”, said Mr Lim. “In every relationship, it is healthy for couples to maintain a good balance of personal and shared space, as personal space allows the individual to retain a sense of self and identity as well as meet their own wants and needs.”\xa0\n“When tensions do arise, having to go to work can serve as a much-needed reprieve for both parties to calm down, allowing them to be in a better state of mind to deal with the conflict calmly when they get back,” he added.\xa0\n“However, having to face each other for long periods of time at home tends to cause individuals to feel frustrated, thus reducing the emotional capacity of both parties to tolerate and enjoy each other.""\nHaving both partners working from home also “blurs the work-family boundaries”, said Mr Lim.\xa0\nBefore the pandemic, people\xa0could focus on work in the office and dedicate time to the family when they are at home. However, the presence of family members or children in one’s workspace at home could result in conflicts in work and family demands, he added.\xa0\n“With the added demand of having to tend to family needs, differences in expectations and values when it comes to the distribution of load in this aspect is also a common point of conflict,” said Mr Lim.\xa0\nThose who work longer hours may expect their partners who do not have jobs or who finish work earlier to take on more household responsibilities, noted Ms Hill. “It could be something like ‘If you finished early how come you didn\'t make dinner?’”\xa0\nCounsellors also noted that monetary and job issues were another factor in many disagreements among couples they saw.\n“There can be the pressures of not knowing if they have a job, or maybe they\'ve already lost a job. There’s an external pressure of money. There\'s also the external pressure of not knowing how long this will last,” said Ms Hill.\xa0\n“And then there’s the thing about whose job is more important,” she added.\xa0\nMORE ENQUIRIES ABOUT DIVORCE\nWhile the Family Justice Court said it “has yet to see a rising trend in the number of divorce applications filed”, several lawyers told CNA that they have had more enquiries since the start of the circuit breaker.\nLawyer Gloria James-Civetta from Gloria James-Civetta & Co said that the firm received between 60 and 80 calls and emails per month from April to June from people looking to get a divorce.\nOn the reasons commonly cited for divorce and separation, Ms James-Civetta said: “Being confined with the person 24/7 made them realise that it is inevitable and no point prolonging the suffering.”\nLawyer Nureliza Syahidain Effendy from IRB Law LLP said she has seen at least 20 per cent more divorce enquiries since April, with many couples specifically citing the circuit breaker as a reason.\n“Prior to (the circuit breaker), they would actually say … oh this person is unreasonable, because of our character differences\xa0et cetera, we are not able to remain married to each other.\n“But when it comes to the circuit breaker itself, they actually quote those reasons specifically, (saying) that because of the recent circuit breaker, we realised that we are not compatible, and I am unable to stand\xa0this kind of behaviour for too long,” she said.\nFinancial issues are another reason cited. With people losing their jobs or being forced to go on no-pay leave, these stressors could take a toll on the marriage, Ms Nureliza said.\nSome have filed on the basis of family violence.\xa0\nCiting a case that she is handling, Ms Nureliza said the woman sought help from the firm as a\xa0victim of domestic abuse.\n“And then,\xa0later on, she decided that look,\xa0because of this domestic abuse, I don\'t think I can tolerate this behaviour; it\'s very stressful for me, it’s very scary to stay with a person who has displayed this kind of behaviour to me. So she has decided to proceed with her divorce.”\nSuch cases make up a significant portion of recent divorce enquiries, she said, attributing it to the rise of domestic violence over the circuit breaker.\nBut not all couples eventually go through with the divorce. Some started proceedings, only to ask later if they can withdraw from the process.\n“I say, sure. Whichever works for you because at the end of the day, make sure that whatever decision (you’re) going to make is not something that (you) will regret in the future, just over a one-time incident,” Ms Nureliza said.\nSETTING BOUNDARIES AND COMMUNICATING BETTER\nIn resolving tensions in the relationship, therapists said couples should set time and space boundaries to ensure a balance of personal and shared space.\xa0\nThis could include having fixed work spaces in separate rooms. They could also discuss which parts of the day they would prefer not to be disturbed, while committing to being more present at home for other parts of the day, said Mr Lim.\xa0\nDr Tracie Lazaroo, a clinical psychologist at\xa0Inner Light Psychological Services and LP Clinic, said couples should manage expectations of each other and fine-tune communicative skills to facilitate conflict resolution.\n“It was also important to teach couples how to manage their anxiety and uncertainty over the lockdown to prevent them from becoming an echo chamber with each other where their projected discomfort and worry creates more tension and strain within the relationship,” she added.\xa0\nPartners should also be mindful that both parties are going through a difficult period, with “heightened demands and emotions”, said Mr Lim.\xa0\n“Being self-aware about the increased emotionality one is experiencing would allow the individual to take a step back to recognise the impact that the external environment has on the relationship.”\nHe added: “While the COVID-19 situation has caused much abrasion in relationships, it has also surfaced many problems in our communication and relational styles that need work. If handled well, we would emerge from this crisis stronger and closer.”\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\n', 'related_topics': ['     COVID-19 ', '     law ', '     Family ']}"

      Malaysian man sentenced to death for importing drugs escapes gallows for a second time
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: A Malaysian man who was sentenced to death for bringing drugs into Singapore escaped the gallows for a second time on Monday (Oct 19) after the Court of Appeal set aside his conviction and found him guilty of a reduced charge of attempted drug importation.\nGobi Avedian, 32, was sentenced instead to 15 years\' jail and 10 strokes of the cane, with the sentence backdated to the date of his remand.\nIn its decision, the court found that the prosecution had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Gobi - who claimed he did not know the bundles he was carrying contained heroin - had been ""wilfully blind"".\nThe decision came after Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon together with Appeal Judges\xa0Andrew Phang, Judith Prakash, Tay Yong Kwang and Steven Chong reviewed and overturned an earlier decision by the Court of Appeal.\nCHOCOLATE DRUGS\nGobi, who was represented in the application by lawyer M Ravi, was a security guard living in Johor Bahru and commuting to work in Singapore at the time of the offence in 2014.\xa0\nGobi was introduced to a person known only as Vinod, who told him he could earn money by delivering drugs mixed with chocolate to Singapore.\nVinod told Gobi that the drugs were to be used in discos and were ""ordinary"" and ""not serious"". He also assured Gobi that he would receive ""just a fine or small punishment"" if he was caught.\nCourt documents state that Gobi initially refused to carry out the delivery but eventually did so because he needed money for his daughter’s operation.\xa0\nHe delivered the drugs from Malaysia to Singapore on eight or nine occasions, receiving 500 ringgit (S$163) for each delivery.\nGobi was caught on Dec 11, 2014 at Woodlands Checkpoint and subsequently handed a capital charge of importing 40.22g of heroin but a High Court judge acquitted him of the capital charge and reduced it to one of attempted drug importation in 2017.\nIn 2018, however, the prosecution appealed on the grounds that the High Court judge had ""erred"" in the decision, and the Court of Appeal convicted Gobi on the original capital charge.\nWILFULLY BLIND AND ACTUAL KNOWLEDGE\n\nOn Monday, the Court of Appeal reversed the decision based on new findings of law handed down in the case of Adili Chibuike Ejike v Public Prosecutor in 2019.\nAdili, a Nigerian man who was\xa0originally sentenced to death for importing about\xa02kg of drugs into Singapore, was spared the gallows upon appeal because he was found not to know of the presence of the drugs.\nIn order for the prosecution to prove the offence of drug importation, they have to prove that the accused was in possession of the drugs, that they had knowledge of the nature of the drugs and that they had intentionally brought the drugs into Singapore.\nThe court found that there was a seeming inconsistency between the prosecution\'s case at trial and its case on appeal regarding Gobi\'s knowledge of the nature of the drugs.\nThe prosecution\'s case at trial was one of wilful blindness, but its case on appeal was of actual knowledge. The court found that this change prejudiced Gobi.\nAs a legal concept, wilful blindness means a person is treated as having knowledge of the nature of the drugs if it can be shown that he suspected something was amiss, yet did not verify that suspicion out of fear of legal consequences, and had reasonable means of discovering the truth.\n""The doctrine of wilful blindness is justified by the need to deal with accused persons who attempt to escape liability by deliberately avoiding actual knowledge,"" said Chief Justice Menon, who delivered the decision.\nThe court in Adili\'s case had newly highlighted the need to keep the concepts of actual knowledge and wilful blindness separate and distinct.\nIn order to establish that Gobi was wilfully blind to the nature of the drugs, the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt - among other factors - that Gobi had a clear, grounded and targeted suspicion that what he was told or led to believe about the nature of the drugs was untrue.\nThe court found that the prosecution had not proven this\xa0element. Gobi had received separate assurances from Vinod and a second person that the drugs were ""disco drugs"" and were ""not ... very dangerous"".\nWhen Gobi inspected the drugs, he saw that they appeared to have been mixed with chocolate. The prosecution did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that despite this, Gobi suspected that he had not been told about the true nature of the drugs.\nThe court therefore found Gobi was not wilfully blind to the nature of the drugs.\n""In the circumstances, the applicant\'s conviction on the capital charge cannot stand, and we set aside that conviction,"" said Chief Justice Menon.\nNOT CONTROVERSIAL FOR LEGAL POSITION TO CHANGE: COURT\nThe decision was due to three circumstances: That the prosecution\'s case at trial was that Gobi was wilfully blind to the nature of the drugs and not that he had actual knowledge of their nature; that the prosecution ran a different case on appeal that Gobi had actual knowledge of the drugs\' nature; and that there was a change in legal position on the doctrine of wilful blindness.\n""It is likely that if any of these three circumstances had been absent, the outcome in this criminal motion might well have been different,"" said Chief Justice Menon.\xa0\n""That the legal position may change from time to time, including as a result of case law development, is not controversial.""\nHe added that it is ""a reflection of the robustness of our legal framework that the court may in limited circumstances take into account subsequent changes in the legal position to reassess previously made decisions, even if they were correct at the time they were made"".\xa0\n""That is precisely what has happened in this exceptional case,"" he said.\nAGC REFUTES COMMENTS\xa0BY LAWYER\nIn a media release sent on Monday afternoon, the\xa0Attorney-General\'s Chambers (AGC) said it was aware of an interview by Gobi\'s lawyer M Ravi that had been uploaded on the Facebook page of The Online Citizen Asia.\nThe AGC said Mr Ravi alleged in the interview that the ""Public Prosecutor was \'overzealous\'\xa0in the prosecution\xa0of the Applicant at first instance"".\n""The insinuation is that the initial conviction of the Applicant by the Court of Appeal in PP v Gobi a/l Avedian [2019] 1 SLR 113 was wrong at the time it was decided and that the Public Prosecutor had acted improperly,"" said the AGC.\nIt added: ""Any such insinuation is categorically false. The Court of Appeal in the decision issued today explicitly pointed out that its initial decision to convict the Applicant was \'correct at the time (it was) made\'\xa0and that none of the arguments considered in the decision delivered today \'could have been made in view of the legal position as it was understood then\'.""\nThe AGC also took issue with what it said was a ""baseless assertion"" by Mr Ravi that ""the application process and the statutory mechanism” put in place for the Court of Appeal to review such previous decisions is ""oppressive"".\n""Contrary to Mr Ravi’s baseless assertion, as the Court of Appeal affirmed, such statutory framework \'is a reflection of the robustness of our legal framework that the Court may in limited circumstances take into account subsequent changes in the legal position to reassess previously made decisions\',"" said the AGC.\n', 'related_topics': ['     crime ', '     drugs ', '     law ']}"

      Commentary: Indonesia has amended 79 laws to boost investment and jobs. But that may yet not be enough
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The Indonesian parliament has passed a new law that aims to boost employment prospects in the country.\nThe Jobs Creation law, passed on Oct 5, is a product of an “omnibus” bill that seeks to be a catch-all legislation that revises a multitude of existing laws and regulations concerning employment and investment.\nIndeed, the considerable heft of the new legislation, at hundreds of pages long, is a direct consequence of the fact that it is amending as many as 79 laws with more than 1,200 clauses in one fell swoop.\nWhile the omnibus law touches on multiple aspects of the investment climate, a key area to focus on – and a lightning rod for protesters in the streets of Jakarta and elsewhere since then – is the host of revisions to the 2003 Manpower Law.\nSEVERANCE PAY REDUCED\nAmong other things, the previous law contains provisions for severance payment that may be deemed over-generous by would-be foreign investors.\xa0\nGoing by World Bank’s numbers, only Sierra Leone and Sri Lanka offer workers higher severance payments among the 135 countries it surveyed.\nUnder the new law, however, the maximum severance payment will be reduced from 32 months of pay to a total of 25 months, with 19 months paid by the companies and the remaining six months of wages paid out of a new unemployment insurance scheme funded by the government, known as the JKP.\nWhile the cutback would appear significant, it is worth noting that the new severance payment remains quite high by regional standards.\xa0\nVietnam, which has been increasingly seen as the leader in attracting FDI within the region, stipulates severance payment of half a month of pay for every year of service.\nMoreover, the previous law might not have offered as strong a legal basis for workers as assumed, in part because it had been so onerous.\xa0\nBy the government’s own admission, only 7 per cent of firms practiced the payment of severance as stipulated by the law.\nOf course, there is no guarantee that a lower, less onerous payment amount now would improve the compliance of the new law since 19 months of salary to be paid out by employers remains costly by many standards.\nHence, the government will probably have to do more in terms of regulatory enforcement to win the trust of workers for the new scheme, even if its own direct participation in the severance payment through the JKP scheme should offer it better visibility.\nOverall, at least the new law has allowed Indonesia to narrow the gap with its regional competitors in the amount of severance payments, allowing it to be more competitive in attracting FDI than before.\nAs the largest country in Southeast Asia whereby about half of its 270 million population are under the age of 30, demographics should have been its biggest draw.\xa0\nFor too long, however, the rigid labour legislation has not allowed it to maximise its benefits from this demographic dividend.\xa0\nThis new law – if properly enforced to maximise its stipulated protection for workers – should go some way in helping Indonesia unlock that demographic potential.\nTIME TO SLIM DOWN\nAnother key aspect of the omnibus law is to provide a legal umbrella for the removal of the multiple layers of regulation at various levels of government that impede investment.\nIn a speech earlier this year, President Joko Widodo (Jokowi) warned that Indonesia is suffering from “hyper-regulation” or “regulation obesity”.\nThe new law offers a potential slimming pill. It stipulates that the central government has the authority to strike down any municipal regulation that runs counter to the higher laws and regulations, with requisite penalties - including the withholding of regional transfer funds from the central government.\nFor good measure, the new law also states that the local governments would have to offer a “one-stop-shop” streamlined investment application process, utilising the same electronic system offered at the central government level.\nIf the rules are not followed despite repeated warnings, the central government has the recourse to take over the administration of the investment approval process eventually.\nWhile it will take some time for the overarching umbrella law to trickle down and change things on the ground – given the multitude of existing overlapping rules and regulations across Indonesia’s 34 provinces and 514 regencies and cities – it would mark the most serious attempt at rectifying some of the excesses of power devolution to the regional governments, since the end of former president Suharto’s era in 1998.\nNOT SO NEGATIVE ERA\nElsewhere, the omnibus law also tries to boost investments by adopting a significant reduction in the so-called Negative Investment List (DNI), which detail industries that FDI is not allowed into.\nIt will now be reduced to just six broad sectors. Casinos, narcotics, chemical weapons manufacturing, for instance, would remain understandably off-limits.\nThis is a considerable reduction from a list of over 300 subsectors before, with industries such as alcoholic drinks production, land transport terminal, flight navigation services, as well as some tourism services being made open to foreign investors now.\nIndeed, having narrowed the downbeat-sounding negative investment list, the government will also issue a new positive investment list that provides extra incentives to encourage the development of high-tech, digital and labour-intensive sectors.\nMeanwhile, with an eye on boosting the flagging property sector in Indonesia, foreigners are now allowed to own apartment units.\xa0\nPreviously, what foreigners had to to obtain a right of use, available for an initial stretch of a 30-years lease and extendable for a further 20 years thereafter.\nEven as the current pandemic-ridden environment would limit the impact of this foreign ownership reform, it could be helpful in rejuvenating hard-hit tourist haunts such as Bali, in terms of retirement homes potential, for example, down the road.\nMore broadly, the omnibus law marks an attempt to boost investment overall and not just FDI per se, by formalising the reduction of the country’s corporate tax.\nInstead of the 22 per cent currently, the corporate tax rate will be reduced to 20 per cent by 2023 with larger “discounts” for listed firms. To incentivise re-investment activities, dividend taxes will be scrapped if firms put their earnings back to work in new investments within Indonesia.\nThese changes could help boost investments, including from its large and cash-rich family-owned corporations who will be well-resourced to take advantage of weak market conditions now by investing in new projects and infrastructure.\nWATCHFULLY OPTIMISTIC\nMarket reaction to the omnibus law passage has been largely positive thus far, but going forward, its optimism might be relatively curbed and there is good reason for it.\nFor one, there is the realisation that, although these new laws are a positive catalyst to investment activities, the measures will take time to implement.\nFurthermore, it comes at a time when global FDI flows might be more impeded given the recent global economic slowdown and lingering uncertainties, even as the structural trend of factories relocating out of China due to cost and geopolitical considerations are positive developments for Indonesia.\nThere is also the backlash from Indonesians on the streets of Jakarta and other parts of Indonesia to contend with. While there remains hope that the demonstrations by labour unions and students have been largely peaceful, any lurch towards violence might mar that assumption.\nMoreover, the potential for a judicial review of the new laws by the Constitutional Court could throw a spanner in the works, as well, with a number of labour and non-governmental organisations voicing their intention to do so, in a last ditch attempt to stop the omnibus law’s implementation.\xa0\nTheir concerns are that workers’ rights are being undermined by these new laws, downplaying the job creation opportunities they bring.\nIndeed, the very nature of the omnibus law’s legal foundation – through which multiple existing legislations are revised by one new legislation – might well become the point of contention.\nHence, as much as the market would likely remain optimistic about the survival of the omnibus law and the positive medium-term impact on the economy, there are potentially some speedbumps to look out for.\nWellian Wiranto is an Economist at OCBC Bank.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Indonesia ', '     employment ', '     investment ', '     law ']}"

      Evidence, intention and involvement: AGC, lawyers explain the decisions behind reducing murder charges
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: In July last year, seven people were charged with murder over the death of a man after a brawl at Orchard Towers.\xa0\xa0\nThe capital charges were later dropped for six of them. Only\xa0the man armed with a knife in the fight faces the murder charge.\xa0\nLast week, one of the six - 27-year-old Chan Jia Xing - was given a conditional warning for a reduced charge of consorting with the armed man. This means he\xa0faces no further developments in the case if he remains crime-free for a year.\nBefore this, his co-accused Natalie Siow and\xa0Joel Tan Yun Sheng\xa0received jail terms of five months and four weeks respectively, while\xa0Ang Da Yuan was sentenced to eight months\' jail and six strokes of the cane.\nThe case has drawn comments from members of the public\xa0questioning the outcome, prompting\xa0the Attorney-General\'s Chambers (AGC) to put out statements clarifying the reduced charges and refuting allegations on social media that claimed the offenders had received preferential treatment in sentencing because of their race.\nCNA spoke to the AGC and several lawyers on some key questions - who decides what charge to tender, what goes into a reduction of a charge, as well as\xa0how and when charges can be reduced.\nWHO DECIDES MURDER CHARGES\nMurder is investigated by the Special Investigation Section of the Criminal Investigation Department, said AGC in response to CNA\'s queries.\nThe police will tender a holding charge of murder if preliminary investigations indicate that such an offence may be made out against the accused person.\n""It is a holding charge because investigations are incomplete and it is necessary for the accused person to be charged and remanded for detailed investigations to be conducted in order to determine if there is sufficient evidence to make out a charge of murder,"" said AGC.\nThe accused will also undergo a psychiatric assessment to determine if there is any mental condition. This goes into assessing whether the accused can rely on the partial defence of diminished responsibility, which can lead to the murder charge being reduced to culpable homicide.\nLawyer Suang Wijaya, partner at Eugene Thuraisingam LLP, told CNA that a person may be given a much more serious holding charge than his ""final charge"", because the exact crime he committed may not be clear at the start of investigations.\nMs Tania Chin, partner of Withers KhattarWong\'s criminal litigation team, said that the AGC typically takes into account several factors when deciding whether to charge someone with murder.\nThese include objective evidence seized, such as closed-circuit television footage, weapons and DNA evidence, or crime scene reconstruction. Witness statements and the accused person\'s statement to the police will also be considered.\nOther possible factors include whether the offence was premeditated, the motive or intention of the accused, as well as his extent of involvement, said WongPartnership partner Melanie Ho.\nWhen the police complete their investigations, they will provide their recommendations on the appropriate charge and the proposed course of action to the AGC, which will review the evidence to determine if it is sufficient to prove the holding charge of murder, said AGC.\nThe public prosecutor\'s office may also direct the police to conduct further investigations to clarify aspects of evidence or look into other aspects of the case, but ultimately it is the AGC that decides which charge to prosecute the accused person for.\n""AGC will first consider whether there is sufficient evidence to prove the holding charge, or any other offence. If there is insufficient evidence to make out the holding charge, the charge will have to be withdrawn or amended to another offence which is supported by the evidence,"" said the AGC spokesperson.\nEven if there is sufficient evidence to make out an offence, the AGC said it will consider whether it would be in the public interest to prosecute, taking into account all relevant facts and circumstances before deciding.\nHOW CHARGES ARE REDUCED\nThe AGC said it can reduce a charge at any point before or during the trial, and the court trying the accused person or hearing an appeal can also amend the charge to a lesser one and convict the accused of the reduced charge.\nThe prosecution can exercise its prosecutorial discretion to amend or reduce any charge before a trial, said WongPartnership\'s Ms\xa0Ho. If a trial has commenced, the prosecution will have to make an application to the court for any amendment of the charge.\nAlternatively, the court may find that the evidence available or heard at trial is insufficient to prove the original charge beyond a reasonable doubt, and therefore frame a different charge, said Ms Ho.\nShe cited some examples of this, such as\xa0the case involving\xa0Miya Manik, a Bangladeshi man who was acquitted of murder and given jail and caning for voluntarily causing grievous hurt, as well as\xa0the parents of a five-year-old boy who was scalded to death.\nThe parents, Ridzuan Mega Abdul Rahman and Azlin Arujunah, were acquitted of murdering their son and given 27 years\' jail and 24 strokes of the cane and 28 years\' jail respectively for voluntarily causing grievous hurt by dangerous means.\nWithers KhattarWong\'s Ms Chin said AGC can reduce charges if evidence uncovered in the course of investigations do not support the elements of the initial charge, and charge reduction could also be done as part of a plea bargaining deal.\xa0\nWhen asked what factors go into having a charge reduced, the AGC said it ""acts in the public interest"".\n""Decisions on whether to prosecute, which charge to prefer and what sentence to submit for, are made having due regard to the evidence available and the circumstances of each case, as well as what is fair, measured, and in the public interest,"" said its spokesperson.\nWongPartnership partner Tang Shangwei said factors that may go into deciding whether a charge should be reduced include information or evidence specific to the accused person that may reduce his culpability.\nWhether the accused had cooperated with investigations, his conviction history, his age and whether the offence was premeditated or spur-of-the-moment are all possible factors that go into this decision as well, he said.\nTHE ORCHARD TOWERS CASE\nCommenting on the Orchard Towers case, the AGC said holding charges of murder with common intention were initially tendered against the seven accused, who were together as a group when the victim was killed.\n""On conclusion of the investigations, the evidence could not make out the offence of murder with common intention against six of them, and their charges were amended based on their involvement in the case. The murder charge preferred against the seventh person, Tan Sen Yang, remains unchanged,"" said the AGC spokesperson.\nIn the case of Mr Chan Jia Xing, AGC considered the extent of his involvement, as well as his cooperation with police investigations and the fact that he tried to stop the attack on the victim.\nAGC therefore directed the police to issue him with a 12-month conditional warning for his charge of consorting with Tan Sen Yang, who carried an offensive weapon in a public place. This charge had been reduced from murder with common intention.\nIf Mr Chan commits another offence during the 12-month period, he can be charged for the fresh offence and the consorting offence.\nMs Chin said the seven originally accused of\xa0murder could have been given those charges at first because initial investigations revealed that they were seen at the murder scene and were involved in some manner with the death.\n""However, if further investigations later reveal that their involvement or role was limited, and there was no plan or intention to cause death, then their charges can, and have rightly been reduced,"" said Ms Chin.\nShe added: ""(This is)\xa0normal as the collection and analysis of DNA evidence, the crime scene reconstruction, autopsy reports and the recording of all statements will require some time, and it is the cumulative assessment of all evidence obtained that would have contributed to the decision to reduce the charges of the other six accused persons originally charged with murder.""\nWongPartnership\'s Ms Ho said it was likely that evidence uncovered after further investigations pointed to the fact that the six accused did not share the common intention to cause the fatal injury to the victim.\n""The reduced charges would be based on their level of involvement in the incident and or whether there are any factors unique to each offender. Such factors would include whether this was their first brush with the law or whether they had similar \'causing hurt\' type convictions on their record,"" said Ms Ho.\nCHARGES REDUCED BASED ON MENTAL CONDITIONS\nMurder charges can also be reduced based on partial defences to murder, where a defence attempts to distinguish between different levels of control or consciousness that an accused person may have when a killing is committed, said WongPartnership\'s Mr Tang.\n""In the eyes of the law, whilst the killing is wrong, the law views the accused person who was suffering from a mental abnormality as less culpable and less deserving of extreme punishment that one who is in full possession of his faculties,"" he said.\nHe referred to the Boon Tat Street case, where the judge found that Tan Nam Seng was suffering from major depressive disorder and was experiencing an episode at the time. His state of mind affected his impulse control and judgment and significantly impaired his mental responsibility for the act. Tan was given eight-and-a-half years\' jail last month for a charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder.\nWithers KhattarWong\'s Ms Chin said AGC could reduce murder charges at an early stage if there is ""strong psychiatric evidence linking the accused person\'s mental condition to the offence and that mental condition would have substantially impaired his mental responsibility for the crime"".\nAGC said one of the partial defences is commonly known as diminished responsibility. This applies if the accused person\'s capacity to know the nature and wrongfulness of his acts or his power to control his acts was substantially impaired by his abnormality of mind at the time of the killing.\nIn order to determine if the accused can rely on diminished responsibility, he will be remanded at the Institute of Mental Health to be examined by a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist will issue an expert report on the accused person\'s mental state, and if the AGC is satisfied that there is a clear and proper basis, it can amend a murder charge to a lesser charge of culpable homicide.\nMr Wijaya said that if the AGC does not find that the accused qualifies for the defence of diminished responsibility, the accused can still argue at trial that he qualifies, and if the court agrees, a lower charge can be given.\xa0\nThe differences in lowered charges are in the sentences that can be imposed.\nIf a person is convicted of murder under section 300a of the penal code, the punishment is death. The punishment for murder under section 300b is death, or life imprisonment with caning, said Ms Ho.\nFor culpable homicide not amounting to murder, a person can be jailed for life and caned, or jailed for up to 20 years and fined or caned.\xa0\nIf the person committed the killing act knowing it is likely to cause death but without intending to cause death or bodily injury likely to cause death, he can be jailed for up to 15 years, fined, caned, or given any combination of these punishments.\nFor voluntarily causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapons or means, a person can be jailed for life, or for up to 15 years and caned or fined.\nFor voluntarily causing grievous hurt, he can be jailed for up to 10 years and fined or caned.\n', 'related_topics': ['     law ', '     murder ', '     AGC ', '     Orchard Towers ']}"

      Parti Liyani seeks compensation order for theft trial, says she suffered losses of about S$71,000
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Ms Parti Liyani, who was acquitted of theft last month, took to the High Court on Tuesday (Oct 27) to seek a compensation order for the case, estimating her losses to be about S$71,000.\xa0\nMs Parti was convicted in March last year in the State Courts of stealing S$34,000 worth of items from former Changi Airport Group chairman Liew Mun Leong and his family when she worked for them as a domestic helper.\xa0\nThe conviction was overturned by the High Court on Sep 4, and she was acquitted of all theft charges.\xa0\nHer lawyer Anil Balchandani told Justice Chan Seng Onn on Tuesday that while he had originally planned to approach Mr Liew and his family directly for compensation,\xa0his client\'s instructions were ""not to add more to (Mr Liew\'s) problems"", as he ""(had) to resign"" from various positions at Changi Airport Group and Surbana Jurong after she was acquitted.\nTherefore, Mr Balchandani sought a compensation order from the court instead.\xa0\nUnder the Criminal Procedure Code, if an accused person is acquitted of any charge for any offence, and if it is proven\xa0that the prosecution was frivolous or vexatious, the court ""may order the prosecution or the complainant or the person on whose information the prosecution was instituted to pay as compensation to the accused a sum not exceeding $10,000"".\nExplaining how he got the figure of S$71,000, which exceeds the maximum sum of S$10,000 allowed for, Mr Balchandani pointed to Ms Parti\'s salary losses of about S$41,000 for about four years between October 2016 and October 2020. This figure was derived from her salary of S$750 per month\xa0as a maid with 20 years of experience.\xa0\nThe S$71,000 figure also included expenses for accommodation incurred by the Humanitarian Organisation for Migration Economics (HOME), which gave Ms Parti shelter after she was dismissed.\n""There has been, in our opinion, some amount of injustice that we wish the court to hear and to order compensation, and\xa0the prosecution has to show why they commenced prosecution,"" said Mr Balchandani.\xa0\nHe added that Ms Parti was asking for ""a nominal amount to show that something\xa0went wrong"".\n""The appellant, who is now a free person, was wronged, and the AGC\xa0could be a little wiser the next time round. That\'s all. This is not meant to prolong an already lengthy trial as well as appeal,"" said the lawyer.\nJustice Chan raised several issues with the figure of S$71,000, pointing out that the maximum sum Ms Parti can be compensated is S$10,000, and questioning if the accommodation costs can be claimed for if HOME voluntarily housed Ms Parti.\xa0\nHe urged both sides to turn to third-party mediation instead, with an external compensation given outside the court, since Mr Balchandani and the Attorney-General\'s Chambers (AGC) had tried negotiating on this matter but failed to agree.\n""You know, there\'s many considerations in this case,"" said Justice Chan. ""The amount is only S$10,000. It\'s not very big. If we go through with this case, we have the hearing fixed for one day, two days, you know the cost of this case is going to be far more than S$10,000.

If this falls through, both Mr Balchandani and the prosecution will return at a later date to resume arguments on the compensation order.\nThis development comes after\xa0Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon granted Ms Parti leave or permission last week, for an investigation to be conducted into her complaint of misconduct against two prosecutors in her trial.\nMs Parti alleged that Deputy Public Prosecutors Tan Yanying and Tan Wee Hao showed a ""lack of candour"" in the way they cross-examined her and presented their position to the court.\nAs a result, she was cross-examined unfairly and misled along with the court, she alleged.\nThe issue stemmed from a DVD player she was accused of stealing from Mr Liew\'s family, that turned out to be faulty but had been presented as working fine by the prosecution.\nThe Chief Justice granted the investigation after finding evidence that there was a case for it.\nA disciplinary tribunal will hear the case and investigate the complaint.\xa0If cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action is found, the Chief Justice could make orders for sanctions such as censures, being struck off the roll and penalties of up to S$20,000.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Parti Liyani ', '     AGC ', '     law ']}"

      Commentary: Indonesia’s new Omnibus Law could signal a 'China turn' in its economic policy
  </h1>, 'text': 'LAMPUNG, Sumatra:\xa0The Indonesian parliament has passed a controversial new act known as the Omnibus Law, so named because it brings together a raft of different measures.\xa0\nThe measures packaged into the Omnibus Law are designed to streamline regulation over the economy, set a structure in place for the construction of Indonesia’s\xa0new capital city\xa0and reinstate a degree of centralisation for decision-making on environmental issues.\nOne of the most important and hotly contested of these measures is the Job Creation Law, which affects livelihood-related issues such as the minimum wage.\xa0\nStrong opposition to the legislative package has manifested itself in protest rallies across the country involving tens of thousands of people and a call for a national strike.\nA GOVERNMENT AGAINST THE PEOPLE\xa0\nPassing the Omnibus Law is a political dream come true for President Joko ""Jokowi""\xa0Widodo.\xa0\nJokowi has often spoken about his dissatisfaction with the country’s ""red tape bureaucracy""\xa0and its impact on doing business in Indonesia.\xa0\nInternational organisations and domestic business lobbies regularly mention this as a\xa0barrier to economic growth.\nJokowi’s administration claims the Job Creation Law will lead to higher levels of foreign direct investment (FDI) through less restrictive regulations, providing a significant boost for employment and the country’s economy.\xa0\nJokowi’s position is strongly supported by major business groups — not least by leading entrepreneurs with close connections to his cabinet.\nOpposition to the law is drawn from a wide range of social forces.\xa0Major labour unions argue that provisions in the law prioritise the interests of the corporate sector and will lead to greater job insecurity and lower pay\xa0in the workplace.\xa0\nThe law, they maintain, is likely to lead to a deterioration in workers’\xa0rights and welfare.\nEnvironmental groups have been among the Job Creation Law’s strongest opponents.\xa0\nThey claim the law will lead to government acquiescence in a renewed and intensified round of damage to\xa0the environment.\nA further element of dissent was introduced when the law was opposed by the Indonesian Ulema Council — Indonesia’s top clerical body chaired by Jokowi’s own\xa0vice president\xa0— and a number of Islamic groups\xa0started street protests.\nThe passage of the Omnibus Law throws up a number of central political issues, three of which we consider here.\nSEEKING FRIENDS IN HIGH PLACES\xa0\nFirst is what it says about the dynamic of Indonesian politics and in particular Jokowi’s current position.\xa0\nThe law was rushed through the People’s Consultative Assembly - Indonesia’s legislature -\xa0with what many civic groups claim was a lack of substantive public consultation.\nIn the wake of the 2019 presidential elections, Jokowi created a grand coalition of parties with only two parliamentary parties ""out of government"".\xa0\nWithin parliament there is virtually no opposition to his administration.\xa0\nThat appears to his critics to have made him beholden to business interests, especially those businesses owned by members of his own\xa0inner circle.\nJokowi seems to have equally distanced himself from informal political actors such as civic and religious leaders and non-ruling elites.\xa0\nThe president is so comfortable in his parliamentary position that he\xa0appears to deem it unnecessary to deploy his own vice president to win support among Islamic groups.\xa0\nStill, there is no single actor able to neutralise the interests of Indonesia’s Islamic leaders today.\nA second issue relates to the potential impact of the law on the economy and whether or not a loosening of regulations will indeed have any impact on inward investment.\xa0\nIn this context, it is interesting to note that on Oct 9, only a few days after the passage of the Omnibus Law, the Coordinating Minister\xa0for\xa0Maritime\xa0and Investment Affairs, Luhut Pandjaitan, held a\xa0bilateral meeting\xa0with the Chinese Foreign Minister, Wang Yi.\nJokowi has given Luhut a mandate to coordinate Chinese investment in Indonesia.\nThis suggests that one aim of the Omnibus Law is to encourage more Chinese investment.\xa0\nMight this signal a ""China turn""\xa0in Indonesia’s economic policy?\nWHO STANDS TO BENEFIT?\xa0\nThirdly, the hasty enactment of the Omnibus Law has highlighted Jokowi’s priorities at a time when the government has struggled unsuccessfully to\xa0stop the spread\xa0of the COVID-19 virus.\xa0\nProponents of the law have argued that the new investment they expect to attract will help the economy recover from the damaging effect of the pandemic and create new employment opportunities.\nBut a widespread feeling exists that the\xa0Jokowi administration\xa0has left the people to suffer the\xa0pandemic while it concerns itself with new ways to advance the interests of those many national parliament members involved in business\xa0activities.\xa0\nIt was the strength of this feeling that helped to bring out so many thousands of protesters to the streets of major Indonesian cities such as Medan, Bandung and Jakarta, despite the potential for further spreading the COVID-19 virus.\nAmid all the current uncertainty, amplified many times over by COVID-19, the passage of the Omnibus Law seems likely to set the tone for Jokowi’s second term in office, if only because of what it tells us about his relationship with other leading centres of national power.\nArizka Warganegara is a Lecturer in the Department of Government Studies at the University of Lampung, Sumatra.\xa0Paul Waley is a Senior Research Fellow at the University of Leeds.

They have blockaded highways leading to the capital for three weeks, and several rounds of talks with the Indian government have failed to produce any breakthroughs.\nFarmer leaders have also planned a token hunger strike on Monday. Heavy contingents of police in riot gear patrolled the areas where the farmers have been camping in New Delhi’s outskirts.\nProtest leaders have rejected the government’s offer to amend some contentious provisions of the new farm laws, which deregulate crop pricing, and have stuck to their demand for total repeal.\nFarmer leaders have threatened to intensify their agitation and threatened to block trains in the coming days if the government doesn’t abolish the laws.\nThe farmers filed a petition with the Supreme Court on Friday seeking the quashing of the laws, which were passed in September. The petition was filed by the Bharatiya Kisan Union, or Indian Farmers’ Union, and its leader, Bhanu Pratap Singh, who argued that the laws were arbitrary because the government enacted them without proper consultations with stakeholders.\nFive round of talks between the government and farmers since November have failed to halt the blockade, with the protesters continuing to insist that the laws be repealed.\nAgriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said last Thursday that the government was willing to amend the laws to allay the farmers’ concerns, but that they should give up their insistence on scrapping them.\nThe farmers fear the government will stop buying grain at minimum guaranteed prices and corporations will then push prices down. The government says it is willing to pledge that guaranteed prices will continue.\nWith nearly 60 per cent of the Indian population depending on agriculture for their livelihoods, the growing farmer rebellion has rattled Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration and its allies.\nModi’s government insists the reforms will benefit farmers. It says they will allow farmers to market their produce and boost production through private investment.\nFarmers have been protesting the laws for nearly two months in Punjab and Haryana states.

      Tobacco retailers get staff ready for raising of minimum smoking age to 21 on Jan 1

These briefings are currently ongoing and take place either in-person or through phone calls.\nNotices explaining the new guidelines will also be placed on the stores’ tobacco cabinets, the representative said, adding that HAO Mart has potential employees watch the Health Sciences Authority’s video on selling tobacco before\xa0they join the company. There are 49 HAO Marts across Singapore.\xa0\nSimilar measures have be put in place at Dairy Farm Group\'s line of retailers including Giant, 7-Eleven and Cold Storage, with signs\xa0on the\xa0new ruling to be displayed from the new year\xa0at ""highly visible parts"" of the store such as at the check-out counters, main entrance and on the tobacco cabinets, a spokesperson said. There are 48 Cold Storage, 53 Giant\xa0and 417 7-Eleven stores in Singapore.\xa0\nEmployees have also been told to ask for photo identification from customers to verify their age, the spokesperson added.\xa0\nA FairPrice spokesperson said that its frontline workers are trained to refuse sale of tobacco to customers below 21 years old.\n“Where in doubt, they are to politely request for proper identification to confirm the customer’s age. No sale will be made if the customer is unable to provide a valid photo ID,” the FairPrice spokesperson added. There are currently\xa0148 FairPrice outlets and 144 Cheers convenience stores that sell tobacco products.\nChairman of Foochow Coffee Restaurant & Bar Merchants Association Hong Poh Hin said his group will send out letters next week to its 400-odd members to remind them to put up the notices somewhere visible.\xa0\nThe letter will also tell coffee shop owners to make sure their workers comply with the rule and to be “very careful” when checking identity cards as 20-year-old customers that have been able to buy cigarettes for some time this year\xa0will not be able to from Friday until they turn 21, said Mr Hong, who runs a coffee shop in Serangoon.\xa0\nOne provision shop owner in Whampoa said he and his wife have been on their guard about selling cigarettes to customers as they are afraid of getting into trouble with the authorities.\nThey will always ask to check the identity card of anyone who looks young, said Mr Ong Beo in Mandarin, who runs the Siong Wan Co store.\xa0And they will refuse to sell if the person says they forgot their card.\nThe age increase will act as hurdle for young people to start smoking, as most people in Singapore who start the habit do so by the time they are 21 years old, said public health expert Yvette van der Eijk from the NUS Saw\xa0Swee Hock School of Public Health.\nDr van der Eijk said raising the minimum age is not a “magic bullet” to curb tobacco consumption, although it will help to bring down smoking rates alongside other policies introduced in recent years. These include prohibiting tobacco\xa0displays in stores and requiring tobacco products to be sold in plain packaging.\xa0\nRetailers who sell any tobacco product to a person below 21 could be fined up to S$5,000 on their first offence, and S$10,000 for subsequent offences, the ministry warned.\nTheir tobacco retail licences will also be suspended for the first offence and revoked for subsequent offences.\nIf any outlet is found selling tobacco products to underage persons in school uniform or those below 12, its tobacco retail licence will be revoked, even if it is the first time they did so.\nIndividuals caught giving or furnishing tobacco to those below 21 may be fined up to S$500 on their first offence and S$1,000 for subsequent offences, while those caught buying or acquiring tobacco for a person below 21 can be\xa0fined up to S$2,500 for the first offence and S$5,000 for subsequent offences.\xa0\nUnderage smokers caught using, buying or keeping tobacco products face a fine of up to S$300.\n', 'related_topics': ['     law ']}"

      Lessons from Parti Liyani case: AG says imperfections in 2020 exposed AGC to 'intense scrutiny and criticism'
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The legal year opened on Monday (Jan 11) with reflections on past cases including Parti Liyani\'s, with the\xa0Attorney-General acknowledging that\xa0there were ""imperfections in the past year"" that exposed the Attorney-General\'s Chambers (AGC) to intense scrutiny and criticism.\nWhile referencing acquittals such as in the widely publicised case of former Changi Airport Group chairman Liew Mun Leong\'s domestic helper, AG Lucien Wong said the year 2020 was ""uniquely challenging"" for AGC as there was ""a sense that the public\'s trust in us was at stake"".\nIn his speech at the opening of the legal year, Mr Wong said prosecutors weathered ""our own crisis of sorts in 2020"".\n""There were several decisions that did not go our way, including Parti Liyani and Gobi Avedian,"" he said to an audience that included attendees in the State Courts and viewers on Zoom.\n""These are not the first high-profile acquittals in our history\xa0and they will certainly not be the last. However, what made 2020 uniquely challenging was a sense that the public\'s trust in us was at stake,"" said the Attorney-General.\nHe said the AGC takes this ""extremely seriously, because that trust is fundamental to our mission\xa0and we work very hard to be worthy of it"".\nThe Chief Justice in his speech also touched on the case of Ms Parti, saying\xa0it would be naive and ""even foolhardy to think that judges are infallible"".\n""That is precisely why virtually all judicial structures in the world incorporate a system of corrective procedures such as appeals, so that where something might have gone amiss at first instance, there is the opportunity to set it right,"" he said.\n""Justice Chan Seng Onn was confronted with that responsibility in Ms Parti Liyani’s case. He carefully scrutinised the evidence that had been led, the arguments that were advanced before him and the judgment of the trial court and arrived at his decision for reasons that he explained in considerable detail,"" said Chief Justice\xa0Sundaresh Menon.\nHe cited Law Minister K Shanmugam\'s observation that this was ""in fact a classic illustration of how the rule of law operates in Singapore"".\n""As he put it, before the court, all are equal, and justice is administered according to the facts and the law as seen by the court,"" said the Chief Justice.\nHe said it is imperative not to rush to judgment and ""condemn errors in the judicial process as suggestive of bad faith or impropriety"".\n""Where there is reason to think that there might have been misconduct, steps will be taken in accordance with the applicable processes\xa0and these must be allowed to take their course,"" said Chief Justice Menon.\nAG LUCIEN WONG ACKNOWLEDGES IMPERFECTIONS\nIn his speech, the Attorney-General assured the public that AGC recognises that it has a ""grave and sacred duty to use our prosecutorial discretion to serve the public interest"".\n""That is the lodestar for all prosecutors. Our motive is not to win at all costs\xa0or to secure the most convictions, but to reach just outcomes fairly,"" he said.\nMr Wong said charging decisions are made only after AGC is satisfied that there is sufficient evidence to support a reasonable prospect of conviction and that it is in the public interest to prosecute.\n""Every prosecution is commenced in the genuine belief that a crime has been committed and needs to be answered for,"" said Mr Wong.\nHowever, if new facts and circumstances come to light showing that prosecution is no longer tenable or desirable after a person is charged in court, AGC will review the matter and withdraw charges.\nWhile lauding his prosecutors for their work, Mr Wong said: ""Even so, I must acknowledge that there were imperfections in the past year that exposed AGC to intense scrutiny and criticism.""\nHe added that this was not the appropriate forum for him to traverse the specifics of these cases, but pledged that AGC will do better to discharge its fundamental duty to assist the court to arrive at the correct decision as ministers of justice.\nAGC is taking concrete steps to live up to this, such as careful review of the training and guidance given to prosecutors and the drawing up of detailed internal guidance on how prosecutors can fulfil their obligations to disclose documents to the defence.\n""A key tenet of prosecutorial training is that all prosecutions should be guided by the public interest. Our culture must be one where prosecutors take pride in doing right, not just by victims of crime, but also by accused persons and by society,"" said Mr Wong.\nIn response to ""the lessons which we learnt from the Parti Liyani case"", the prosecution is working with the police on internal guidelines for recording investigative statements properly and obtaining proper valuations of items which are the subject of property offences.\nTo help preserve and enhance the public\'s trust, AGC will also step up its efforts to ""demystify the inner workings of prosecution"" and make the criminal legal system more accessible and intelligible to the public.\nSome ways AGC has already tried to do this include\xa0clarifications of misinformation for cases that draw widespread public interest, as well as articulating the basis for its decisions.\xa0\nThe Orchard Towers death is one such case that saw AGC issue press statements to refute allegations of racial bias, and to explain charging and sentencing positions.\nFor Parti Liyani, AGC also issued media releases ""to clarify the process by which the charging decision was made, so as to dispel any misconception that the complainant was given special treatment or that I was somehow involved in the charging decision in view of my prior acquaintance with (Liew Mun Leong)"", said the Attorney-General.\n""Through the initiatives I have described, we are working to address institutional gaps and provide greater accountability to the public,"" said Mr Wong.\xa0\nHe asked for understanding from the public, adding that AGC does not shy from criticism as long as it is fair.\n""Not every acquittal is a sign that our prosecutors have failed in their duty as ministers of justice,"" he said.\xa0\n""Some acquittals may result precisely because we took steps which served the interests of justice but were adverse to our case, for instance, by sharing evidence with the defence.""\nHe added that acquittals ""are a sign of health for the legal system"" in the broader scheme, demonstrating that judges probe the prosecution’s case and apply their minds fairly and independently.\xa0\n""More importantly, acquittals also show that AGC does not only pursue cases that are easy wins, but also cases where we truly believe that an offence has been committed and must be addressed,"" he said.\n""The real measure of AGC as an institution does not lie in the number of convictions we secure, but in prosecuting worthy cases fairly and upholding the public interest,"" said Mr Wong.\xa0\n""We will not allow the fear of failure or of public backlash to stand in the way of this duty. Let me stress this clearly – neither acquittals nor baseless lawsuits or actions commenced against my Chambers or my prosecutors will deter us from fulfilling our mission to prosecute in the public interest.""\n', 'related_topics': ['     law ', '     Parti Liyani ', '     AGC ']}"

""All cases were promptly re-fixed for hearing, and many have already been substantively disposed of.""\nThe Family Justice Courts lost about 588 hearing days, but all held-over hearings were re-fixed and started by November last year.\nIn the State Courts, 2,033 hearing days were lost as a result of the vacation of hearings during the circuit breaker period, but cases that were held back have either been disposed of or have had their hearings fixed, except for\xa0""a very small handful of cases"".\nAttorney-General Lucien Wong said the COVID-19 crisis ""brought out the best in AGC"", providing public agencies with crucial legal support while the Government ""worked tirelessly to respond to the pandemic"".\n""Once the severity and potential impact of the disease became clear, we formed a cross-divisional COVID task force in January 2020 comprising representatives from all our legal divisions,"" said Mr Wong.\xa0\n""We anticipated that the Government would need urgent and cross- cutting legal advice and support to address a possible pandemic and its repercussions. This proved to be prescient.\xa0\n""In the first half of 2020 alone, we received more than 1,300 COVID-related requests for advice. Almost all of these were urgent – we responded to 69 per cent\xa0of these cases within 24 hours and 78 per cent\xa0within 48 hours. The pace and intensity of this work were unprecedented, and I am glad to say we came through for our clients.""\nAGC\'S RESPONSE TO COVID-19\nAGC\'s contributions included working with its officers who were posted to satellite legal departments in various ministries, advising the Government on establishing quarantine facilities, securing borders and protecting trade flows, said Mr Wong.\n""We also provided critical legal support on the tapping of past reserves to finance the various COVID response budgets, on the impact of COVID on Government contracts, and on negotiations for the procurement of possible COVID vaccines,"" he said.\nAGC also drafted major pieces of legislation in record time to allow the Government to ""quickly implement new measures to control the spread of the disease, such as safe distancing measures and contingency healthcare arrangements"" and introduce schemes for financial, tax and other reliefs to sustain the economy.\nAGC worked closely with law enforcement agencies to enforce the Infectious Diseases Act and COVID-19 legislation strictly and swiftly, quickly dealing with breaches of quarantine orders, stay-home notices and other restrictions.\n""In addition to our COVID work, AGC kept the legal machinery of Government running in a very different operating environment,"" said Mr Wong.\n""Criminal prosecutions and urgent civil litigation matters continued during the circuit breaker period and beyond, but with many more remote hearings. Our officers adapted rapidly by learning how to present arguments and, in some cases, examine witnesses over Zoom.\xa0\n""Through countless Skype meetings and emails, we maintained our usual pace of drafting and providing advice and legal representation to the Government – including during the recent General Elections, which presented particular difficulties due to COVID restrictions. We had to urgently advise the Government on how to deal with the unique challenges and legal complexities involved in holding an election in the midst of a pandemic.""\nMr Wong said AGC will roll\xa0out digital innovations such as legal automation in the year ahead. AGC is currently developing a contract drafting application that will save public officers time spent on manually amending templates.\nBy the first quarter of 2021, it will launch the Legislation Code System, a computer-readable reference protocol for legislation tagging where every Act, section and subsection of the law will have a unique identifier code enabling enterprise searching across case databases, parliamentary reports, journal articles and press releases.\nThere are also plans to fully integrate the internal criminal case management systems with those at the enforcement agencies, the courts and prisons.\n""I have been humbled and heartened to witness my officers coming together to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the entire public service, both to manage this unprecedented crisis and also to keep essential operations running in new and innovative ways,"" said Mr Wong.\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\n', 'related_topics': ['     AGC ', '     law ', '     COVID-19 ']}"

  </h1>, 'text': 'NEW DELHI: Tens of thousands of protesting Indian farmers plan to blockade highways across the country for three hours on Saturday (Feb 6) to press their demands for the repeal of new agricultural laws.\nAuthorities deployed thousands of security forces mainly outside India’s capital, where farmers have camped at three main sites for more than two months. They say they won’t leave until the government rolls back the laws it says are necessary to modernise Indian agriculture.\nThe scheduled highway blockade is set to start at noon local time (2.30pm, Singapore time).\nSeveral rounds of talks between farmers with the government have failed to produce any breakthroughs.\nThe farmers say the laws will leave them poorer and at the mercy of corporations. Their action is a major challenge to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\nOn Friday, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar defended the laws in Parliament, dampening hopes of a quick settlement as he made no new offer to resume talks with the farmers.\nThe largely peaceful rally turned violent on Jan 26, India’s Republic Day, when a group of farmers riding tractors veered from the protest route and stormed the 17th century Red Fort. Hundreds of police officers were injured and a protester died. Scores of farmers were also injured but officials have not given their numbers.\nFarmer leaders condemned the violence but said they would not call off the protest.\nSince then, authorities have heavily increased security at protest sites outside New Delhi’s border, adding iron spikes and steel barricades to stop the farmers from entering the capital.\n', 'related_topics': ['     India ', '     protest ', '     agriculture ', '     law ']}"

      Mediation may be made compulsory in cases of neighbour disputes as inter-agency committee reviews measures
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: An inter-agency committee is conducting a “comprehensive review” of the Community Dispute Management Framework\xa0that helps to manage disputes between neighbours.\nAuthorities could, for instance, make it compulsory for parties to turn up for mediation and counselling.\nSpeaking in Parliament on Tuesday (Mar 2), Second Minister\xa0for Law Edwin Tong said the review will focus on resolving disputes up front, increasing the take-up of community mediation\xa0and improving the Community Disputes Resolution Tribunal (CDRT) process.\xa0\nThe committee comprises the Ministry of Law, Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth, Ministry of National Development and the Ministry of Home Affairs.\nAuthorities have seen a rise in feedback on neighbourly nuisance in the past year, probably due to more staying home during the COVID-19 ""circuit breaker"" period, Mr Tong said during his ministry\'s Committee of Supply speech.\n""First, we will look\xa0at how neighbourly disputes can be better managed and resolved upfront,"" he said.\n""When the disagreements arise, we need to quickly identify and address the root cause of the issues. This helps to preserve the goodwill before it festers and progressively tapers down. And also in this context, community leaders can play a big role.""\nIf informal resolution fails, parties can opt to go for community mediation or take the case to the CDRT.\nCOMMUNITY MEDIATION\nMr Tong said the committee is looking into measures to increase the take-up of community mediation, including raising awareness on the benefits of mediation.\nMr Tong added that community mediation is affordable and effective when parties approach it with open minds, pointing out that more than 80 per cent of cases mediated at the Community Mediation Centre reached an amicable settlement.\n""The challenge, however, is getting parties to mediation. Because mediation is largely voluntary, there are also many parties who\xa0refuse to turn up for mediation, and that can arise from any number of different reasons peculiar to the case,"" he said.\n""This is not healthy for the neighbourly relationship in the longer term, and my ministry acknowledges that we can look at how we can improve the take-up rate of mediation, perhaps make it compulsory. And these are areas we are studying seriously.""\nThe committee will consider suggestions by Members of Parliament on ""compulsory mediation and counselling"", he said, adding that it will also explore a suggestion of continuing to track a case even after it has been disposed of in the CDRT.\nCOMMUNITY DISPUTES RESOLUTION TRIBUNAL\nAs for the CDRT, Mr Tong said this should be a last resort, as these proceedings are\xa0not structured to help parties mend their relationship, and cannot supervise or monitor how parties behave after the end of the proceedings.\xa0\n""There are limits to what the courts in the adjudicatory process can do. The courts are ultimately\xa0arbiters of who is legally right and who is legally wrong, and it is a binary zero-sum game,"" he said.\nAnd while CDRT proceedings are ""designed to be quick and straightforward"", they are\xa0delicate and often challenging, the minister added.\nMr Tong said the committee will consider if\xa0legislation needs to be clarified to help parties that\xa0find it difficult to gather evidence to support their claim, and prevent proceedings from being ""unreasonably and unnecessarily onerous"".\n""This is even though the CDRT is not itself bound strictly by the\xa0rules of evidence, and proceedings are judge-led,"" he said.\nMr Tong said the committee will also consider if the CDRT could\xa0make interim orders, especially in cases of severe and continuing nuisance.\nIt will also close gaps in addressing respondents who willfully refuse\xa0to comply with the CDRT’s order, and look at\xa0whether current measures are sufficient to protect communities from anti-social, nuisance behaviour.\n""In one\xa0egregious case, the respondent started to create a different type of nuisance not covered by the CDRT\xa0order, presumably to spite the claimant after having gone through the process,"" he said.\n""If a party does not comply with a CDRT order, the CDRT may issue a Special Direction.""\nNon-compliance with a Special Direction is a criminal offence, and can also result in a court order that excludes the offending party from his or her place of residence, Mr Tong said.\nA total of 24 Special Directions have been issued for egregious cases as of the end of last year, with two Exclusion Orders issued, he said.\nSince the CDRT started operations in\xa02015, 591 claims have been filed as of the end of last year, with more than one in five ordered to undergo mediation.\nMr Tong said the majority of cases are resolved within six\xa0months, while the remainder are resolved within 12 months and a handful of cases take\xa0longer than 12 months.\n""Whilst\xa0we can introduce more and enhanced measures, ultimately at the end of the day, it is fundamental\xa0for neighbours to maintain a culture of open communication, mutual respect and understanding,"" he added.\n""And to the extent possible, may I ask that Members also refer parties and encourage them to attend mediation, given that mediators are well-trained and the numbers at the Community Mediation Centre have proven successful at resolving these disputes.""\nPROTECTION FROM HARASSMENT ACT\nMr Tong also gave an update on the Protection from Harassment\xa0Act (POHA), with 853 applications for Protection Orders (PO) filed as of the end of last year.\n""This includes applications by victims of sexual and workplace harassment, online harassment, as well as harassment by neighbours,"" he said.\n""Data based on types\xa0of harassment are currently not available, but the State Courts are looking into enhancing the case management system to capture and track such data.""\nOf the 853 PO applications filed, 135 cases were sent for mediation. A total of 366 Expedited Protection Orders were granted, meaning the Courts granted interim relief in more than four\xa0in 10 applications.\nA total of 348 POs\xa0were granted, of which more than half were granted with the consent of both parties. ""This suggests that a good number of cases were resolved amicably,"" Mr Tong said.\nThe remaining applications were either withdrawn, dismissed, struck off or are pending resolution.\nOver the years, Mr Tong said the Government has\xa0strengthened\xa0protections available under POHA by creating new offences like doxxing and introducing new remedies for victims of online falsehoods.\nAs of the end of last year,\xa029 cases of doxxing have been filed in the State Courts.\nThe dedicated Protection from Harassment Courts will also begin operations this year, Mr Tong said, noting that it will simplify procedures and expedite timelines\xa0for certain types of applications.\n""We will continue to monitor the effectiveness of the 2019\xa0amendments, and provide a more holistic assessment after the POHA Court has been in operation\xa0for some time,"" he added.\nDIGITALISING LEGAL\xa0PROCESSES\xa0\nMr Tong also touched on the digitalisation of\xa0legal\xa0processes, saying the pandemic has accelerated the shift towards non-traditional modes of court hearings\xa0where both litigants and counsel may not be present before the judge in the same physical location.\nThese include conducting hearings through video-link\xa0or based on documents filed by parties -\xa0measures that\xa0have been ""positively received"" by court users and members of the Bar, Mr Tong said.\n""We will build on these successes\xa0and facilitate the technological transformation of our court system, and expand\xa0the existing scope of non-traditional modes of hearing,"" he added.\n""This will of course\xa0be subject to appropriate safeguards to ensure that the propriety, integrity and fairness of the hearing, which are ultimately of paramount consideration, will be upheld.\n""These changes will help the courts to improve the efficiency and accessibility of court processes, and also lower the cost of dispute-resolution for litigants.""\nMr Tong acknowledged\xa0challenges faced by law practices, especially smaller firms, in having to invest time and effort to identify, curate and integrate technology into their workflows.\nTherefore, the Ministry of Law\xa0is planning to develop an integrated Legal Tech Platform that unifies law firms’ existing technology tools, Mr Tong said.\nThe platform will be designed specifically to facilitate legal workflows from end-to-end, enabling law practitioners and lawyers to work anytime and\xa0anywhere, he said.\n""It will have a single unified user interface for lawyers to access the functionalities, such as case and document management, as part of the existing tools,"" he added.\n""It will also allow\xa0lawyers and clients to collaborate easily on legal matters via a one-stop-shop platform as far as technically feasible.""\nThis platform will allow them to share documents and jointly work on such documents on this platform, and aggregate client communications from platforms such as Microsoft Teams and Slack.\n""The platform will aim\xa0to supplement and support existing legal technology adopted by firms,"" he added.\n""We aim to make lawyers ultimately comfortable with\xa0using the existing tools and at the same time going onto the platform and adopting these new legal solutions.""\nHELPING LAW STUDENTS AND FRESH GRADUATES\nAs for law students and fresh graduates, Mr Tong said the Law Ministry will continue to work with institutions to finetune curriculums and ensure that law students are well-equipped to meet changing demands in the legal practice.\n""This will also include changes to the practice training regime, which MinLaw has accepted in principle, and which it will be working with stakeholders to implement in 2023,"" he said.\nThe changes include completing\xa0one year of practice training with a firm instead of the current six months, after passing the Singapore Bar examinations.\nMP Hany Soh (PAP-Marsiling-Yew Tee) then asked if the ministry could consider expanding the list of places where law graduates can serve their training contracts, including the Law Society\'s pro bono services where manpower is needed.\n""We certainly encourage lawyers to take part in pro bono services and offer their services, and anything we can do to promote that area, we will consider,"" Mr Tong responded.\n""Having said that, a training contract is for the purposes of ensuring that the trainee lawyer comes through to the market, is\xa0able to serve and practise in the market.\n""So it\xa0may not be feasible to just serve a training contract in the Law Society\'s pro bono\xa0office. But that can be certainly one factor and one aspect of practice that they can look into.""\n', 'related_topics': ['     Edwin Tong ', '     law ']}"

      Penalties for 3 sex crimes to go up after review, academic potential should not carry much weight: Shanmugam
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The maximum penalties for three types of sexual offences will each be increased by a year, after a review of how some sexual and violence-related crimes are sentenced by Singapore courts, Minister of Law K Shanmugam said on Friday (Mar 5).\nOn top of this, mitigation pleas in certain types of offences based on the offender’s educational qualifications or academic potential “should not carry much weight”, he said in\xa0a ministerial statement in Parliament.\xa0\n“You shouldn’t be able to come to court and say you have a bright future,\xa0you will go far and so on,” said Mr Shanmugam, who is also the Minister for Home Affairs.\n""You can go far. But first - serve the sentence,"" he said. Members of the House thumped their chairs in approval at this statement.\nThe move comes after widespread debate over the sentencing of multiple university students for sex-related crimes, with some calling for tougher sentences.\nThe three types of sexual crimes that will have their maximum penalties increased are: Outrage of modesty or molestation, sexual activity carried out in the presence of a minor aged between 14 and 16 or showing them sexual images, as well as similar activity done in front of a minor aged between 16 and 18.\nThere has been a 24 per cent increase in the number of reported cases of outrage of modesty from 2016 to 2020 versus 2011 to 2015, said Mr Shanmugam.\nAs egregious cases should be dealt with more severely, the maximum jail term will be increased from two years to three years for molestation.\nThe maximum penalties for sexual activity in the presence of minors or showing sexual images to them - whether they fall in the age bands of between 14 and 16 or 16 and 18 - will be increased from one year to two years\' jail.\n""Voyeurism is not merely a thoughtless act that a young student commits in a moment of folly,"" said Mr Shanmugam.\xa0\n""These and other similar offences, whether committed against\xa0female or male victims, should be dealt with seriously.\xa0\n""These actions must be seen as an affront of fundamental values. There can in general be no excuses for these offences.""\nAGC WILL OBJECT TO REHABILITATIVE SENTENCES FOR SOME TYPES OF CASES\nMr Shanmugam added that the Attorney-General\'s Chambers (AGC) will generally object to rehabilitative sentences - such as probation - for adult offenders who commit certain types of sex crimes or crimes causing physical hurt.\nThe need for proportionate punishment and deterrence must take precedence over rehabilitation, said the law minister.\nMr Shanmugam said it should be clear that an offender will not receive a lighter sentence simply because he has higher educational qualifications or better prospects.\nVoyeurism and similar offences committed against female victims should be dealt with seriously and there can be no excuses in general for such crimes, he said, adding that rehabilitation should not trump principles of proportionate punishment and deterrence.\nApplying the new amendments to the law to past cases that have drawn public attention and debate, the law minister gave the example of a Yin Zi Qin, an NUS student who climbed into his ex-girlfriend\'s home with her and choked her.\nHe was given a short detention order for 12 days, a day reporting order for five months with counselling and an order to complete 80 hours of community service over a year.\nThis was in accordance with the law at the time, said Mr Shanmugam. However, if he had committed these acts on or after Jan 1, 2020, when new Penal Code provisions kicked in, he would likely have been charged under the new offence of voluntarily causing hurt to a victim whom he was in an intimate or close relationship with.\nHe would have been liable for up to twice the maximum penalty for voluntarily causing hurt: Up to six years\' jail, a fine of S$10,000, or both.\nUnder the new law, he would not have been eligible for community-based sentences as these are generally only available for offences punishable with a maximum jail term of three years.\nThe criminal justice system reflects the values of society, and the starting point should be that such criminal conduct should never have happened, with ""no excuses"", said Mr Shanmugam.\nADVISORY PANEL TO BE SET UP, GUIDE PREPARED TO EDUCATE PUBLIC\nBeyond this, an inter-agency sentencing advisory panel will be set up to issue non-binding sentencing guidelines to help achieve more consistency in sentencing and better public education on such issues.\nThe panel will include stakeholders from the criminal justice system including the AGC, the Ministry of Home Affairs, the police and members of the judiciary.\nTo help the public find out more about the sentencing process, the Ministry of Home Affairs and MinLaw have prepared a guide on sentencing in Singapore, with the help of the AGC and the Law Society.\nThe guide explains sentencing processes in the courts and addresses questions of public interest such as what sentencing objectives are, what are the common types of sentences imposed, how a court decides what sentence to impose and what factors it takes into account.\nThe increased penalties are the latest in several amendments the Government has made over the years on sex and hurt crimes. In 2019, amendments to the Penal Code and the Protection from Harassment Act meant offenders face enhanced penalties for cases involving minors, victims in close or intimate relationships with the offender, domestic workers and physically or mentally disabled victims.\nAmendments that kicked in on Jan 1, 2020, criminalised acts that have become more prevalent with technology, such as voyeurism and spreading intimate images without consent.\nMEMBERS SEEK CLARIFICATIONS ON NON-ARRESTABLE OFFENCES, EDUCATION\nLeader of the Opposition Pritam Singh asked if the ministry has considered looking at voluntarily causing hurt offences that are not arrestable in a more “variated manner"". This is so that it can take ""expedited action in the appropriate cases”.\nMr Shanmugam said Mr Singh’s question highlights one of the “more involved discussions that the Ministry of Home Affairs has been having, with me involved”.\nHe noted that Mr Singh’s intent of asking the question is that criminal law is not the best solution for these cases and it should be dealt with in other ways without undermining the rule of law.\n“We agree and there are some internal frameworks for the police to try and assess that and deal with it. If the police try to deal with every single case of police report on voluntarily causing hurt, it would be an impossible situation and I don\'t think will be better off as a society,” Mr Shanmugam\xa0said. He added that people who are “not happy” can pursue other routes.\nMP Nadia Ahmad Samdin (PAP-Ang Mo Kio) asked if the Government will consider putting in place programmes and training to better ensure trauma literacy within the criminal justice system to safeguard the interests of victims of hurt and sexual offences.\nIn response, Mr Shanmugam said that victim impact statements can be submitted to court so that the court is better informed about the impact of the offence on the victim and the emotional and physical trauma suffered. He added that gag orders can be applied to protect the alleged victims’ identities.\nHis ministry is also exploring the possibility of using video-recorded interviews with victims, then “using those videos as evidence in court in lieu of examination in chief”.\n“We think that that might help reduce the victims’ trauma from having to recount again in court the ordeal that the person went through,” he said.\nCOMPOSITION OF PANEL\nMP Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (PAP-Chua Chu Kang) asked if the panel could be invited by the Court of Appeal to provide their views before sentencing in a particular case, something which he said happens in Australia.\n“I say this so that we don\'t shut up any possibility of flexibility to cater to evolving societal needs and specific individual cases,” he said.\nHe also asked if the panel can be diverse in terms of gender and expertise,\xa0and if the panel could include victim crime support advocacy groups and criminal justice professionals.\nIn response, Mr Shanmugam said that diversity is a “buzz word”.\n“I am a believer that you appoint the appropriate persons to the right job. This requires expert viewpoints. The guidelines from the panel must carry weight. It must have gravitas for judges to take it seriously,” he said.\nA variety of viewpoints can be taken,\xa0he said, adding that non-governmental organisations and people who want specific laws or specific types of penalties to be changed will have an interest, he said.\nHe said that by necessity, the panel will “not be a very large” panel. \xa0\n“You must appoint a panel that is open to hearing all these viewpoints. But the panel must have the expertise to make an assessment based on the law, and what makes sense and put it across- open-minded, but an open mind is not an empty mind,” he said.\n“It must also not absorb whatever nonsense that comes up, it must be able to assess what makes sense, what doesn\'t make sense, make an assessment, give guidelines that would carry authority and respect.”\nWatch the full statement:\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     crime ', '     law ', '     K Shanmugam ']}"

Another two charges will be considered in sentencing.\nThe court heard that the victim, Justice See Kee Oon, upheld on Mar 30 last year that Section 377A is constitutional after three men mounted challenges against it: Disc jockey Johnson Ong Ming, retired general practitioner Roy Tan Seng Kee and Bryan Choong Chee Hoong, the former executive director of LGBT non-profit organisation Oogachaga.\nAfter the verdict, the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) support organisation Pink Dot SG issued a statement on Instagram expressing its disappointment at the result.\nHanif, who was closely following the case, felt very upset and disappointed when he heard that the challenge was dismissed. He felt that the current judges ""had to be replaced"", the court heard.\nHe made comments on Pink Dot SG\'s post, as well as his own public Instagram account, which had 267 followers at the time, containing threats and incitements to violence.\nHe posted an Instagram story at 4.02pm on Mar 30, 2020, saying: ""To the deadass boomer of a judge who dismissed the challenges against S377A, you better f****** watch out!!""\nHe followed this with a comment on Pink Dot SG\'s Instagram post at 7.17pm that day, writing: ""Time to hunt down the oppressive judges, who basically maintained the legalisation of discrimination against us, and make them pay the ultimate price.""\nAt 7.49pm, he posted another InstaStory that said: ""Can we please torture the corrupted judges until they f****** crumble & repeal S377A on the spot!? Pretty please, I\'d love to personally torture them to their breaking point..""\nHE THREATENED JUDGE AND JUDICIARY: PROSECUTOR\nThe prosecution is calling for at least seven months\' jail for Hanif, saying the judiciary ""must be inoculated from threats aimed at intimidating them into adjudicating otherwise than in accordance with the law"".\n""As judges are expected to remain above the fray of controversial disputes, they cannot publicly defend themselves against such threats,"" they said, adding that it falls upon the law to ""protect its guardians"".\nThe prosecutors added that Hanif not only threatened a judge but the judiciary as an institution, stressing that ""any unhappiness with judicial decisions, however controversial, should be aired respectfully, and challenges to judicial decisions should be made through proper legal avenues"".\nThe threat Hanif made had the potential to inflame the emotions of individuals who viewed it, and he knew that the issue was a highly divisive one, which meant the post would gain significant traction and viewership, the prosecutors said.\nThey added that Hanif demonstrated contempt for Justice See, a senior member of the judiciary, by referring to him as a ""deadass boomer"" and accusing him of legalising discrimination.\nHanif will return to court next month for sentencing.\nFor communicating an incitement to violence, he could be jailed for up to five years, fined, or both. For making threatening communication against a public servant, he could be jailed up to a year, fined up to S$5,000, or both.\n', 'related_topics': ['     crime ', '     Section 377A ', '     law ']}"

      US Supreme Court bars suit against Facebook under anti-robocall law
  </h1>, 'text': 'WASHINGTON: The US\xa0Supreme Court on Thursday barred a proposed class action lawsuit accusing Facebook Inc of violating a federal anti-robocall law, sparing the social media company from a potentially costly fight over unwanted text messages.\nThe justices, in a 9-0 decision authored by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, sided with Facebook in its appeal of a lower court ruling that revived the lawsuit alleging that the text messages violated the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, a 1991 law that sought to curb telemarketing abuse by banning most unauthorised robocalls.\nThe court ruled that Facebook\'s actions - sending text messages without consent - did not fit within the technical definition of the type of conduct barred by the law, which was enacted before the rise of modern cellphone technology.\nThe lawsuit was filed in 2015 in California federal court by Montana resident Noah Duguid, who said Facebook sent him many automatic text messages without his consent. The lawsuit accused Menlo Park, California-based Facebook of violating the Telephone Consumer Protection Act\'s restriction on using an automatic telephone dialing system.\nThe case highlighted the challenge for the justices in applying outdated laws to modern technologies. In this instance, the lawsuit asserted that Facebook\'s system that sent automated text messages was akin to a traditional automatic dialing system - known as an autodialer - used to send robocalls.\n""Duguid\'s quarrel is with Congress, which did not define an autodialer as malleably as he would have liked,"" Sotomayor wrote.\nThe law requires that the equipment used must use a ""random or sequential number generator"" but the court concluded that Facebook\'s system ""does not use such technology,"" Sotomayor added.\nDuguid said that Facebook repeatedly sent him account login notifications by text message to his cellphone even though he was not a Facebook user and never had been. Despite numerous efforts, Duguid said he was unable to stop Facebook from ""robotexting"" him.\nFacebook responded that Duguid had most likely been assigned a phone number that had been previously associated with a Facebook user who had opted in to receive the notifications.\nA federal judge threw out the lawsuit but in 2019 the San Francisco-based 9th US\xa0Circuit Court of Appeals revived it.

      Parti Liyani's lawyer crosses swords with deputy chief prosecutor in unprecedented compensation bid
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: In a full-day hearing on Friday (Apr 16), Ms Parti Liyani’s lawyer crossed swords with a deputy chief prosecutor in an unprecedented bid to seek a compensation order of S$73,100 for a “frivolous and vexatious” prosecution of Ms Parti.\nMs Parti, who returned to Indonesia in January, was convicted in March 2019 by a lower court of stealing items worth S$34,000 from then-Changi Airport Group chairman Liew Mun Leong and his family.\xa0\nThe High Court overturned her conviction in September 2020 and acquitted her of all theft charges.\nIn the aftermath, two prosecutors in charge of Ms Parti\'s trial at the lower courts are\xa0facing\xa0a disciplinary tribunal after Ms Parti sought an investigation into their alleged misconduct.\nThe sum of S$73,100 that Ms Parti is seeking includes salary losses of S$37,500 over 50 months, ""ang paos"" or red packets, pay increments and S$29,400 for her lodging provided by the Humanitarian Organisation for Migration Economics (HOME).\nLawyer Anil Balchandani sought the sum in the first application under Section 359(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code for compensation from the prosecution, citing various reasons on how the prosecution was “frivolous and vexatious”.\nSection 359(3) of the CPC states: “If an accused is acquitted of any charge for any offence, and if it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that the prosecution was frivolous or vexatious, the court may order the prosecution or the complainant or the person on whose information the prosecution was instituted to pay as compensation to the accused a sum not exceeding $10,000.”\nWHAT IS ""FRIVOLOUS AND VEXATIOUS""?\nThe court appointed an independent party, Singapore Management University\'s Assistant Professor of Law Benjamin Joshua Ong,\xa0to give his views on various legal arguments.\nAsst Prof Ong laid out the history of the particular section allowing compensation from the public prosecution: It was amended to allow for this in 2010, and before that, a person could get compensation from a complainant only in a private prosecution.\nUp to 2010, it was thought that the public prosecutor could be relied on to never engage in frivolous or vexatious prosecutions, and this was a sufficient safeguard. However, that changed in 2010, explained Asst Prof Ong.\nHe gave his expert opinion that the legislative intent of the purpose of Section 359(3) is to create a new law. The prosecution\'s stance is that compensation can be sought from the prosecution only if it was malicious, but Asst Prof Ong said malicious prosecution is provided for under Section 359(5), and 359(3) refers to ""frivolous and vexatious"".\nThe phrase ""frivolous and vexatious"" has existed in law since the 1900s and has its roots in the law of striking out a civil action, explained Asst Prof Ong.\nIt refers to something that ought to be stopped and is ""plainly unsustainable"", whether legally or factually, he added.\nLAWYER ANIL BALCHANDANI’S ARGUMENTS\nMr Anil called this ""an exceptional case"" that falls within the confines of what Section 359(3) is meant to address, with aspects of a ""frivolous and vexatious"" prosecution ""spread throughout"". Despite it being clear that prosecution was legally unsustainable, the prosecutors continued their case against Ms Parti, he charged.\n""The foundation that I wish to make is that the court found improper motive by ... Karl Liew\xa0specifically and this lays the foundation that there was indeed not just a matter of finding Parti not guilty beyond reasonable doubt but that the charges or the complaint, and of course the prosecution beyond that was indeed not done correctly,"" said Mr Anil.\xa0\nHe charged that the prosecutors in Ms Parti\'s case ""lacked seriousness"", giving an example of how the defence found the correct date of when Ms Parti ceased to be employed by the Liew family\xa0with ""a few clicks of the button"", when the prosecution got it wrong.\nHe also charged that the prosecutors had relied on improperly procured statements, which\xa0Ms Parti gave that were not in her own language, and photos of evidence shown to her that were blurred or taken in a rushed manner.\nWhen they realised there were deficiencies in\xa0her statements, the prosecutors did not stop or withdraw, alleged\xa0Mr Anil.\nProsecutors Tan Yanying and Tan Wee Hao had also ""withheld evidence"" on the functionality of a DVD player Ms Parti was accused of stealing, he claimed.\nThe prosecution responded to this by saying that the defence had not been prejudiced by this, because they had allowed the defence to inspect the DVD player over lunch, and added that the defence had embarked on a lengthy demonstration showing the equipment\'s limitations after.\n""It appears to be an answer created after the fact. It does not consider what would have happened if the defence counsel never bothered to perform a demonstration,"" said Mr Anil.\xa0\n""Would the DPPs (Deputy Public Prosecutors) have in fact made the announcement? That the DVD player was not functioning? And we further state that this position of a lack of proper and full disclosure did not stop at the trial but continued before Your Honour at the High Court.""\nKARL’S LACK OF CREDIBILITY WAS PLAIN: ANIL\nAnother point Mr Anil made was on how the prosecution had continued with charges related to Mr Liew\'s son Karl\xa0""despite his lack of credibility as plainly evinced by his testimony"".\n""Karl\'s lack of credibility was evident perhaps from the moment he finished spelling his name,"" said Mr Anil, prompting a retort from Deputy Chief Prosecutor Mohamed Faizal on how this is ""a massive overstatement"".\nMr Anil pointed to a\xa0blanket that Karl said was from a store in the United Kingdom called Habitat, when it had an Ikea tag on it. He claimed that women\'s clothes in the theft charges belonged to him, even though they did not fit him.\nKarl was charged in February with giving false evidence and information in the case, and is expected back in court in May.\n""If this were a civil case, and counsel for the plaintiff or defendant were faced with this information, they would quickly advise their client to do something. But in this case, we are faced with the prosecution\'s mentality of \'full steam ahead\', irrespective of whether the witness comes to court and says \'You\'re right, I made a mistake\'.\xa0\n""And so this case presents an exceptional opportunity for the court to address Section 359(3) ... for an appellant who is acquitted to seek redress for problems faced at trial,"" said Mr Anil.\nAnother point Mr Anil made was on how the prosecution allegedly rejected his attempts to introduce evidence of how Ms Parti was illegally deployed to other homes and offices to clean.\n""It was one of the issues of the trial. It was relevant to show that Ms (Parti) had some reason to believe there was a motive behind her immediate termination. But the prosecution kept on objecting - tenaciously, fervently and consistently,"" he said.\n""The prosecution\'s response to this in their submissions ... is that they are entitled to object to questions in a trial that appear irrelevant. Our case is that their objections were premised because they knew that the answers as a result of these questions would be unfavourable to them.""\nDEPUTY CHIEF PROSECUTOR INTERJECTS\nAt this, Mr Faizal interjected to say he took ""great issue"" with this, as Mr Anil had imputed motive and led no evidence to prove such an allegation.\n""If he is going to make allegations in relation to motive in the manner he has just done, then I would ask him where is the evidence?\xa0\n""And if the answer is there is no evidence, then what is the basis of that assertion?"" Mr Faizal told Justice Chan Seng Onn, who presided over the hearing.\n""It cannot be that - they say because they objected, I infer they acted in bad faith. By that definition the prosecution, and the applicant\'s counsel, by objecting to various lines of questioning, would be objecting in bad faith, because we can just impute bad faith. I have severe reservations as to what my learned friend said.""\nIn response, Mr Anil said not all objections are similar, and that this issue on illegal deployment was one that was\xa0known at trial, because prosecutors had the information as Karl had said that Ms Parti had worked at his office only once. But the defence\'s case was that she did so for a full year.\nIn response to Mr Anil\'s arguments, Mr Faizal said ""there is deep irony in the entire situation"" as Mr Anil had claimed that the prosecution had not given the defence time to prepare for trial, when Mr Anil was making new points in his oral arguments when he had months to prepare written ones.\nAfter Mr Faizal expressed his ""grave reservations"" to this, Mr Anil said Mr\xa0Faizal was ""overreacting"". Justice Chan\xa0interjected that it was not likely a deliberate suppression of information and that people tend to think of new information as time passes and ""we can\'t know everything"".\n""\'We can\'t know everything\' will be the main thrust of what our argument will be,"" responded Mr Faizal.\nReferring to how Mr Anil, in hindsight, was scrutinising the prosecutors’ conduct down to the minute detail, Mr Faizal said it is ""always easy in a case involving 3,700 pages of notes of evidence to take a step back, look through the notes of evidence and then say this went wrong"".\nMr Faizal said anyone could scrutinise trial notes for any acquittal and even conviction to look for missteps, but added that\xa0the reality of litigation is “fluid” and prosecutors work with imperfect information.\n""The reality of litigation is - you never know how witnesses respond on the stand. That is the reality of how the criminal process works. All my learned friend has done is to effectively say:\xa0\'We should have known\'\xa0... What he is asking this court to do is to insist this court require the prosecution to have 20/20 hindsight.""\nMr Faizal said\xa0it is in the nature of the findings of any conviction-turned-acquittal that there will be serious issues.\xa0\nHowever, he said Mr Anil\'s application is ""patently unmeritorious"" and should be dismissed as he has fallen far short of showing how Ms Parti\'s prosecution was frivolous and vexatious.\nJustice Chan adjourned the case to a date yet to be fixed for Mr\xa0Faizal to make his arguments and finish the hearing.\nThe disciplinary tribunal for the two prosecutors in Ms Parti\'s case is pending. If cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action is found, the Chief Justice could make orders for sanctions such as censures, being struck off the roll and penalties of up to S$20,000.\n', 'related_topics': ['     crime ', '     Parti Liyani ', '     AGC ', '     law ']}"

      Commentary: Hybrid working may change contractual terms and conditions for employees
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Certain countries, such as the Netherlands, have had a head start in putting in place hybrid working legislation, well before COVID-19 brought homeworking to the forefront, to protect the interests of both the employer and its employees.\xa0\nSuch legislation typically regulates flexible working arrangements including working hours, working times and places of work.\xa0\nEmployers may deny requests for flexible working for compelling business interests such as security issues, work schedules or financial and organisational problems.\nSuch legislation is also intended to ensure that there is no discrimination against those who opt to work from home to overcome the traditional social stigma surrounding those who work from home.\xa0\nThis is critical to ensure that equal rights and opportunities are afforded to those opt to work from home.\nIn Singapore, employers are seriously considering such a hybrid model of working as the way forward. For many, this could mean working from home for part of the week and working in the office the rest of the time.\nMinister in the Prime Minister’s Office Indranee Rajah\'s exhortation to employers to consider offering staff a hybrid work arrangement beyond COVID-19 to allow them to attend to elderly parents or young children, has also been met with broad support and approval.\nBanks like DBS Group, Citigroup Inc and Mizuho Financial Holdings News, for example, are paring down office space as they transition to hybrid work - showing that the decentralisation is here to stay, especially given the trend of rapid digitalisation.\nCan employers keep up with these changes from a legal perspective however and how will that impact employees?\nPHYSICAL WELL-BEING AND SAFETY\nAccording to Singapore’s labour laws, employers bear the burden of ensuring a safe workplace. But how are employers meant to protect the health and safety of employees who are not working out of a physical workplace within their control?\nMinister of State for\xa0Manpower Zaqy Mohamad confirmed in Parliament in June 2020 that work from home arrangements do not change an employer\'s responsibility for work injury compensation.\xa0\nThe firm will have to ascertain that the injury arose while the employee was performing work activities at home.\nThis is easier said than done and can have serious ramifications for employers, who find themselves facing a novel situation of potentially being held responsible for injuries that occur in employees\' homes, to which employers have no access, and over which employers typically exert no control.\nAn extreme yet entirely plausible example of this is as follows: During office hours, an executive, seated at his desk at home, takes a work-related call on his mobile. He gets up and walks across the room to retrieve a document needed for the call, trips over his toddler’s toys and fractures his foot. It almost seems absurd to even suggest any liability on the part of the employer, but could it be argued that the executive was injured ""on the job""?\xa0\nSince the Workplace Safety and Health Act\'s application to remote working is untested, responding to complaints and actions for work-related injuries and illnesses will be challenging.\xa0\nWhen employees are working outside the office, it may be less clear when an act is performed in the course of employment.\nTo limit their liability for such accidents, some companies have started to carry out occupational safety assessments in employees\' homes to identify risks and measures to mitigate these risks, whether by way of physical inspections, via Zoom or over an app.\xa0\nThis must be balanced against employee\'s rights to privacy and should be subject to prior notification and agreement. Employers are thus modifying their policies to contractually provide for such potential intrusions.\nEmployers may also follow the example of France, which has rolled out self-assessment forms to be completed by employees in respect of occupational risks related to working from home.\nIn Belgium, legislation has been enacted to ensure that teleworkers are covered by occupational accident insurance if the accident occurs at home, during working hours and in a place listed as a workplace in the contract.\nIn Singapore, companies such as Salesforce and Autodesk are adopting a variety of measures to mitigate their liability, including providing employees with a technology budget to ensure they have proper and ergonomic equipment at home.\nEmployers are also clearly stipulating working hours, rest days, overtime and other terms that remote-working employees must abide by in order to avoid claims of breaches of the Employment Act by employees, given that working times are less defined in a homeworking environment.\nEMPLOYEES’ MENTAL WELL-BEING\nEmployers are potentially facing the reverse challenge of ring-fencing employees\' personal and home lives from the increasing encroachment of work – which have led to complaints of depression, anxiety and burnout.\nA survey by National University Health System\'s (NUHS) Mind Science Centre on mental health resilience revealed that 61 per cent of those working from home reported feeling stressed, more than the 53 per cent of front liners in the pandemic feeling likewise.\nThis could also be due to the higher incidence of domestic issues employees may face while working from home. AWARE saw a drastic 116 per cent increase in domestic violence helpline calls by April 2020 from a year ago while the police reported a 22 per cent jump in monthly average cases of family violence during the circuit breaker.\nRemote working poses a significant and unique challenge to employers seeking to support and promote mental health in their workforce given that it is much harder to assess how their employees are coping from a distance.\xa0\nIt has been suggested that companies consider investing in wearable tech to collect data on the mental health of their workforce and measure stress responses, subject to data protection of sensitive health data.\nThe Tripartite Advisory on Mental Well-Being at Workplaces, introduced in November 2020, educates employers on progressive ways in which they can support employees’ mental health, such as providing access to external counselling services. While laudable, the advisory lacks bite and doesn\'t compel employers to adopt the suggestions.\nA more concrete commitment would be to expand the list of Occupational Diseases under the Work Injury Compensation Act (WICA), to\xa0include mental health illnesses related to work stress, which would have the effect of holding employers accountable.\xa0\nIt would also be a positive step forward to recognise certain mental health issues as being a form of disability, which should be a protected characteristic when it comes to discrimination.\nCountries such as Italy, Ireland, and the Philippines, have promulgated ""right to disconnect"" laws on answering work calls and emails outside of office hours to prevent employee exhaustion and burnout.\nMember of Parliament Melvin Yong also mooted this in Parliament in October 2020, given that employee burnout complaints have heightened during the pandemic. However, would it be practical across different industries, or be seen as overly prescriptive?\nIn the interim, it is crucial that companies put in place measures, benefits, and policies to safeguard their employees\' long-term mental health, taking into account the unique stressors posed by hybrid working.\nCompanies such as LinkedIn, Cisco, Google and Thomson Reuters offer firm-wide mental health holidays for staff to unplug and recharge in the face of soaring burnout rates. Companies have also offered resilience training, guided meditation and well-being sessions, including for remote employees.\nINFORMATION SECURITY AND CONFIDENTIALITY\nBesides the people challenges, there’s also the technology-related issues. Remote working questions how employers can protect their data and confidential information as the ingress and egress of third parties to such remote locations isn\'t secure and tightly controlled by the company.\nWhen the circuit breaker hit, companies scrambled to provide employees with the necessary technology and equipment to facilitate remote work with little time to deep dive into the security implications of remote working.\nSo, companies may have allowed employees access to customer and other data, heightening the risk of leakage of such sensitive information, whether by shoulder surfing or eavesdropping of spouses or visitors to the house, employees leaving physical copies of documents lying around and viewed by unauthorised parties.\nAllowing remote workers to access company networks through homeworking environments also introduces vulnerabilities to cyberattacks.\nIn a paper released by the MAS and the Association of Banks in March, risks in areas such operations, technology and information security, fraud and staff misconduct and legal and regulatory risks were flagged for attention and recommended preventive and detective measures, including staff surveillance for high-risk activities.\nCompanies may thus introduce new policies to safeguard their data privacy and cyber-security by regulating staff remote working behaviour, including prescribing locations where staff are not permitted to work remotely such as in shared public working spaces like cafes and hotel lobbies.\nOtherwise, they risk facing complaints and actions for breaches of confidential information, under the Personal Data Protection Act, and other requirements on the use, disclosure, retention and processing of personal data.\nGiven that our working landscape is changing, companies will need to put in place the necessary policies and procedures to mitigate new risks. Workers need to be ready for that.\nListen to\xa0EngageRocket CEO Leong Chee Tung and HR strategist Adrian Tan\xa0debate the merits of returning to the office on CNA\'s Heart of the Matter podcast published in 2020:\n\nAmarjit Kaur is a Partner at Withers KhattarWong in its litigation and arbitration team.

      Commentary: Self-driving buses and delivery robots welcomed but who do we blame if AI goes rogue in Singapore?
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Earlier this year, Luda Lee, an AI (artificial intelligence)-powered chatbot, went “rogue”.\nCreated by Korean start-up Scatter Lab, Luda was designed to chat naturally with South Korean Facebook users (attracting more than 750,000 over just 20 days), and to improve based on user data.\nSoon after however, Luda Lee began making bigoted and offensive comments against women, minorities, foreigners and people with disabilities.\nShe even randomly shared the personal data of its users. Her creators apologised but now face lawsuits over the data leaks.\nWhile some consider this a relatively innocuous example, there are cases where more serious harms were caused by AI-made decisions.\nIn one high-profile example in 2018, a pedestrian was hit and killed by a self-driving Uber car whose sensors had failed to “see” and avoid her.\nConcerns over algorithmic high-frequency trading triggering widespread financial market crashes, such as the flash crash of 2010, have also been raised.\nThese come as Singapore is ramping up its use of AI in all areas of life. In November 2019, the Government announced its National AI Strategy, which spells out plans to deepen Singapore’s use of AI to transform our economy and society.\nJust this year, commuters could begin taking driverless buses at the Singapore Science Park and on Jurong Island, while on-demand delivery robots are being trialled in Punggol. Even robot dogs have been patrolling Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park to ensure safe distancing among park-goers.\nWhile extensive pre-trials would have been conducted, alongside safety precautions taken during their roll-out, Moore’s Law dictates that we ask: In the unlikely event that serious harms, whether physical, emotional or financial occur, on whom (or what) does legal “blame” lie, and on what basis?\nFINDING THE SMOKING GUN\nThese questions were the focus of a recent law reform report published by the Singapore Academy of Law’s Law Reform Committee, as part of a series looking at the impact of robotics and AI on the law.\nAs this report notes, these questions sometimes have relatively straightforward answers. For instance, if a malicious individual deliberately programmes a delivery robot to break into someone’s house, or disrupts the signals to a driverless bus, causing it to veer off the road and crash, most would agree that individual should be held liable.\nIn addition, if somebody sustains serious injury or dies from the individual’s deliberate actions, some form of criminal punishment would not seem unfair. Indeed, criminal laws already exist to deal with such issues.\nSave for some tweaks, present laws could still tackle cases of intentional harm, even in an AI-powered world.\nWHAT HAPPENS WHEN NO HUMAN INTENDED THE HARM?\nThings get trickier, however, in situations where a human did not intend the harm that arose. This is particularly so as AI systems become more autonomous, and humans’ roles in their operation and supervision diminish.\nAlready, driverless vehicles present such a conundrum today, given that they operate at speeds that may not leave users time to take control and prevent the harm. What then?\nAn instinctive response might be to say the entities responsible for the system should be punished. But which entities? There are usually multiple parties involved in the development and deployment of AI systems.\nShould the liable party be the one that built the system; programmed the system’s code; trained the system; put it on the market, or deployed the system?\nPutting aside challenges of identifying harmful intent, it can be tricky to pinpoint the blameworthy party in this chain. Pinning criminal liability on all of them would also likely have a counterproductive effect of discouraging innovation – the legal equivalent of using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.\nThis same challenge besets the use of criminal negligence laws in situations where an offender (an individual or company) carelessly causes harm, even though no harm was intended.\nDoes this mean that serious harms could be inflicted by robots and AI systems, with no one being held criminally liable?\nSome take this view, preferring the use of regulatory penalties such as censures, improvement notices and fines to promote the safe and responsible use of AI systems. The argument goes that threatening criminal liability on those who create AI systems for harms they didn’t foresee deters the development of new, potentially game-changing technologies.\xa0\nOthers counter some cases of harm are so serious that criminal laws are needed to ensure that someone or something is held accountable for the damage done, to reflect society’s abhorrence at such harmful conduct and to set a strong deterrent.\nThese questions and trade-offs are matters that policymakers and society need to deeply consider.\nWEIGHING THE ALTERNATIVES\nOne possible approach could be to impose specific duties on designated entities to take all reasonable measures necessary, to ensure the AI system’s safety.\nThese entities would risk criminal penalties if they fail, much as worksite operators are required to ensure the safety of workers on those sites.\nAnother more radical solution could be to impose criminal liability on and “punish” the AI system itself, particularly with highly-advanced autonomous systems. After all, is it not the system that took the “decision” to act in a harmful way?\nThis approach is not unheard of: The European Parliament has suggested it be considered further, and even Saudi Arabia has recognised the robot Sophia as the world’s first “robot citizen” just a few years ago.\nHowever, such a solution does appear impractical in today’s legal systems, which are shaped primarily to regulate human behaviour, as well as at the present state of technology. After all, what purpose would it serve today if a driverless bus in Jurong Island or a delivery robot in Punggol were charged, convicted and sentenced to prison, fined, or even put to “death”?\nBut as AI systems become more and more sophisticated, these questions are no longer the preserve of science fiction.\nA silver bullet or one-size-fits-all solution is unlikely. Different technologies and different contexts will likely require different approaches to whether, how and against whom to apply criminal law.\nPolicy and ethical balances will need to be struck.

      Court orders probe into alleged misconduct by Lee Kuan Yew's lawyer after Lee Wei Ling, Lee Hsien Yang's complaints
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: A High Court judge on Wednesday (Apr 21) granted bids by Dr Lee Wei Ling and Mr Lee Hsien Yang for a disciplinary tribunal to investigate the alleged misconduct of the former lawyer of their late father, founding prime minister Lee Kuan Yew.\nJustice Valerie Thean ordered the Law Society to apply to the Chief Justice to appoint a disciplinary tribunal to look into two of the Lee siblings\' complaints about the conduct of Ms Kwa Kim Li over the handling of the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew\'s wills.\nThe two complaints, outlined in a letter by the two Lee siblings to the Law Society in September 2019, were that Ms Kwa had failed to follow Mr Lee Kuan Yew\'s instructions to destroy his superseded wills, and that she had given false and misleading information to them in two emails she sent in June 2015.\nMs Kwa, the managing partner of law firm Lee & Lee, had helped Mr Lee Kuan Yew draft six wills between Aug 20, 2011 and Nov 2, 2012. His first will and last will were not prepared by Ms Kwa.\nDr Lee and Mr Lee Hsien Yang submitted a letter to the Law Society dated Sep 5, 2019, comprising four complaints about Ms Kwa.\nThe four complaints are:\n- First, that Ms Kwa had failed to follow Mr Lee Kuan Yew\'s instructions to destroy his superseded wills\n- Second, that Ms Kwa breached privilege and her duties of confidentiality by sending emails with records of communications with Mr Lee Kuan Yew to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who was not an executor of the estate\n- Third, that Ms Kwa had failed to keep proper contemporaneous notes and records of all the advice given and instructions received from Mr Lee Kuan Yew\n- Fourth, that Ms Kwa had given false and misleading information to the executors Mr Lee Hsien Yang and Dr Lee Wei Ling in two June 2015 emails.\nAfter considering reports dated May 2020 and August 2020, the Council of the Law Society wrote to Dr Lee and Mr Lee Hsien Yang on Sep 7, 2020 informing them that\xa0it would apply to the Chief Justice to appoint a disciplinary tribunal only for the second complaint.\xa0\nISSUES TAKEN TO COURT\nHowever, the Lee siblings made an application to the court, seeking Ms Kwa\'s conduct for the remaining three complaints to be investigated as well.\nJustice Thean on Wednesday found that prima facie cases - cases that are of\xa0a matter of sufficient gravity for formal investigation - were established for only the first and fourth complaints.\nThe complaints were\xa0over Ms Kwa\'s alleged failure to adhere to Mr Lee Kuan Yew\'s instructions to destroy the superseded wills, and for giving false and misleading information to the two Lee siblings.\nJustice Thean ordered the charge for the first complaint to be framed according to the Inquiry Committee\'s report, as the committee found there was a case made out.\nThe fourth complaint of giving false and misleading information centred around two emails Ms Kwa sent to Mr Lee Hsien Yang and his sister in June 2015.\nEMAILS ABOUT MR LEE KUAN YEW\'S WILLS\nAfter their father died, PM Lee and Dr Lee asked Ms Kwa for records and information of the various wills that Mr Lee Kuan Yew had signed prior to his final will.\nMs Kwa replied to them in an email\xa0on Jun 4, 2015 and included Mr Lee Hsien Yang in her reply captioned: ""Chronology of 6 Wills - my file records with focus on Oxley"".\nMs Kwa had framed the request made by PM Lee and Dr Lee as one for ""file records of (Lee Kuan Yew\'s) previous wills, for notes/emails/information on his instructions to (Ms Kwa) regarding Oxley"". Oxley refers to Mr Lee Kuan Yew\'s family home, a subject of contention among his children after his death in March 2015.\nThe two younger Lee siblings contend that Ms Kwa made a significant omission in her Jun 4, 2015 email by failing to mention her discussions with their father in emails sent in November and December 2013.\nJustice Thean said Ms Kwa\'s email did represent its content to be a comprehensive summary of the work Ms Kwa had done on the six wills and the Oxley property, but failed to include information about Mr Lee Kuan Yew\'s instructions regarding changes to his sixth will and their discussions about the Oxley property in 2013.\n""This could have misled the executors into thinking that the Jun 4, 2015 email contained everything regarding the first six wills and the Oxley property,"" said Justice Thean.\nWhile considering the initial queries, Ms Kwa\'s answer could be misleading in that it was not a full answer, the High Court judge said.\nAfter this email, PM Lee and Dr Lee had further queries, so Ms Kwa wrote another email on Jun 22, 2015 to the three Lee siblings, titled Estate of Lee Kuan Yew.\xa0\nTwo days after this, Mr Lee Hsien Yang and Dr Lee’s lawyers wrote to Ms Kwa to note that the documents and information relating to Mr Lee Kuan Yew\'s past wills were confidential and subject to attorney-client privilege. They requested that no further documents be disclosed to any party except the authorised representatives of Mr Lee Kuan Yew\'s estate. PM Lee was not an executor named in his father\'s final will.\nThe judge noted that Ms Kwa had also stated that Mr Lee Kuan Yew did not instruct her to change his will after signing his sixth will, but this representation ""was not correct"" as further emails showed instructions from Mr Lee Kuan Yew regarding changes to his sixth will.\n""In my view, in the full context of the initial queries, the Jun 4, 2015 email contained an omission. The Jun 22, 2015 email made a representation that was not true, and omitted to answer fully the specific question that was repeated. The issue is whether these emails should be characterised as false and misleading, and the executors submit that they should be so characterised,"" Justice Thean said.\nShe added it was plausible that Ms Kwa did not intend to make any false and misleading statement, but said there was a range of possibilities as to what inference should be drawn - which would fall on the disciplinary tribunal during its investigation.\nTHIRD COMPLAINT DISMISSED\nJustice Thean did not order an investigation into the third complaint - that Ms Kwa had failed to properly record all the advice and instructions that Mr Lee Kuan Yew gave her.\nThe Law Society had submitted that Ms Kwa did keep sufficient notes, citing various examples and arguing that ""a mere failure to keep detailed and formal notes on every occasion should not of itself result in a sanction against a legal professional"".\nJustice Thean agreed there was no prima facie failure to keep proper records raised and dismissed the two Lee siblings\' application to order an investigation into this complaint.\nUnder the Legal Profession Act, all advocates and solicitors proven guilty of any breaches that amount to improper conduct or practice can be struck off the roll, censured or made to pay monetary penalties.\n', 'related_topics': ['     law ', '     Lee Wei Ling ', '     Lee Hsien Yang ', '     Lee Kuan Yew ']}"

      Woman 'going crazy’ over daily piano sounds from next door: Nuisance neighbours and what you can do
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: At first, Ms C (not her real name) thought it was ""quite nice"" to hear piano music coming from her neighbour\'s home during the ""circuit breaker"" period, when people were ordered to stay in to curb the spread of COVID-19.\xa0\nThen about six months later, from October 2020, her next-door neighbour began playing the same song daily, between 7am and 11pm.\xa0\xa0\n""She was waking us up every single day,"" Ms C, who is pregnant and in her 30s,\xa0told CNA.\xa0\nIt got so bad that she and her husband started hearing the song in their heads even when it was not being played. They live\xa0in a condominium in western Singapore.\nMs C said she tried several ways to resolve the issue, including reaching out to the neighbour.\xa0She claimed the woman was\xa0""quite adamant"" that she could continue what she was doing\xa0and that it was ""her right to play the piano"".\nAfter her\xa0husband spoke to the neighbour\'s husband, the woman switched to playing a second song, but did so over and over again,\xa0said Ms C.\nWhen she contacted the condominium\'s managing body, she said she was told that they could not do anything, as there is no by-law stating a specific time when the neighbour could or could not play the piano.\n""But the by-laws do say that all residents are given the right to peace and quiet … so if music is penetrating into my house, even with all the doors and windows closed, shouldn\'t that be an issue? But the MCST was just quite not helpful,"" said Ms C.\nThe sound of the piano can be heard loudly\xa0in the corridor just outside Ms C’s home, and at a lower volume in Ms C’s bedroom, according to audio clips that she provided to CNA.\nThere are other pianists in the condominium, but only their next-door neighbour creates such a noise, she said. According to Ms C, the neighbour who lives above the piano player also\xa0experienced the same issue.\n""It\'s like to the point where - whenever there is peace and quiet, my husband and I will second-guess ourselves whether she’s playing the music, because we can hear the whole song in our head, because she plays it over and over again,” said Ms C.\xa0\n“It’s actually the mental part that really got to us ... I think if she plays different songs throughout the whole day it wouldn’t be so bad, but it’s because she plays the same exact piece the whole day that … I think we are going crazy.”\nShe had contacted CNA\xa0after reading about a trial between two condominium neighbours. The case involves a\xa0woman who took her upstairs neighbour to court in a private prosecution, alleging\xa0abusive behaviour such as repeatedly splashing water down into her home and deliberately bouncing a ball. No verdict has been reached and the trial continues in July.\n\n\nMs C said\xa0she read up on her issue and thinks the police would tell such victims to solve the matter themselves. In the meantime, she mitigates the problem by turning up the volume on her television.\xa0\nShe is considering moving out.\nNUMBER OF NEIGHBOURLY DISPUTES ROSE IN 2020\nAccording to a spokesperson from the Ministry of Law, which oversees the Community Mediation Centre (CMC) that handles neighbourly disputes, the number of such cases\xa0rose in 2020 from the year before.\nMost of the disputes registered in 2020 were related to noise, unacceptable conduct\xa0or cigarette smoke, said the spokesperson.\nShe said the increase could be attributed to more residents staying at home during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly during the circuit breaker months, as well as increased awareness of CMC\'s services.\nOf the cases that went to mediation, more than 80 per cent were resolved amicably, said the ministry.\nThe Ministry of National Development (MND) previously said that HDB received an average of 3,400 reports or feedback per year on ""social disamenities"" between neighbours from 2015 to 2019.\nFrom January to September 2020,\xa0HDB\xa0received about 11,400 cases of feedback on noise from residents\' daily activities. This is an\xa0increase from the 3,600 cases logged for the same period in 2019.\nThere were about 500 cases of feedback per month from January to March 2020, increasing to about 1,800 cases per month from April to July 2020, especially during the circuit breaker\xa0period when most people had to stay home.\xa0\nThe number of feedback cases fell to 1,300 per month from August 2020, likely due to people returning to work and school.\nHOW THE LAW PROTECTS RESIDENTS FROM NUISANCE NEIGHBOURS\nLawyers told CNA that residents are protected from neighbourly acts that cause nuisance\xa0under two laws -\xa0the Community Disputes Resolution Act (CDRA), which prohibits causing unreasonable interference with a neighbour\'s enjoyment or use of his home, and the Protection from Harassment Act (POHA).\nMr Alvin Lim, a partner at WongPartnership in specialist and private client disputes practice, said the CDRA was specially enacted to address the problem of nuisance neighbours.\xa0\nExamples of ""unreasonable interference"" by neighbours\xa0include: Causing excessive noise, smell, smoke, light or vibration, littering in the vicinity of the resident\'s home, obstructing the home, interfering with the person\'s movable property, conducting surveillance on the resident\'s home and trespassing.\n""In addition, it is not uncommon for a neighbour\'s pet to be a nuisance,"" said Mr Lim. The CDRA also protects against a situation where a neighbour allows his pets to trespass on the resident\'s home and cause excessive noise or smell or to defecate or urinate near his home.\nPOHA, on the other hand, protects an individual from acts that cause harassment, alarm or distress, and a wayward neighbour may be subject to criminal sanctions and civil claims, said Mr Lim.\nIt is an offence for a person to use threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour that cause a victim to suffer harassment, alarm or distress. If a resident makes a police report against their neighbour, authorities will investigate and decide whether to prosecute the neighbour.\nIf not, the resident can also consider filing a magistrate\'s complaint to pursue a private prosecution against the neighbour.\nWHAT CAN RESIDENTS WITH NUISANCE NEIGHBOURS DO?\nThere are several avenues for residents\xa0to seek recourse. Mr Lim said the first port of call should be through mediation at the CMC.\nThis is a consensual and private process where a trained neutral third party - a mediator - helps the neighbours to understand each other\'s unhappiness and guide them to arrive at a mutually acceptable solution.\n""The collaborative and solution-orientated approach of CMC mediation has resulted in a high success rates,"" said Mr Lim. ""It is also a cost-effective option, and can preserve the neighbourly spirit. If a solution can be reached at the mediation, the neighbours will record it in written form and agree to abide by their chosen solution.""\nHowever, if the neighbour does not want mediation or if it is unsuccessful, the victim may have no choice but to take the dispute to court. If a person files a police report but it is not deemed a police case, there are a few legal avenues open.\nA person can file a magistrate\'s complaint and pursue a private prosecution if the neighbour has potentially committed a criminal offence, or file a claim under the Protection from Harassment Act if they have suffered harassment, alarm or distress.\xa0\nLawyer Joel Wong, an associate\xa0from Eugene Thuraisingam, LLP\xa0said a magistrate\'s complaint seeks punishment for the offender, while a civil suit seeks compensation.\nIn magistrate\'s complaints, the person filing it will have to bear his own legal costs, while costs in a civil suit are decided at the end based on ""blameworthiness"".\nThe same legal recourse is available regardless of housing type, Mr Lim said.\n""However, the nature of high rise apartment living and greater common spaces in HDB flats and condominiums have the potential to give rise to more neighbourly disputes. For example, disputes may arise from a neighbour’s love for karaoke, cooking of pungent dishes or renovation of his unit, especially where these are done thoughtlessly or taken to an extreme,"" he said.\nWith condominium residents, rules and by-laws are an additional factor, as they may impact the rights or obligations of a neighbour and may involve the MCST.\nFor landed properties, some of the more common neighbour disputes involve landscaping issues, such as a tree that grows from one resident\'s home and overhangs his neighbour\'s. Mr Lim cited a case his law firm saw where the neighbour offered to engage a gardener to have the tree pruned, and the brewing dispute was resolved.\n“If the parties’ differences cannot be reconciled with mediation, they may make an application to the Community Dispute Resolution Tribunal (CDRT) as an avenue of last resort to resolve their dispute,” said a spokesperson for the Law Ministry.\nWHAT IF THE NEIGHBOUR DOESN’T COMPLY?\nLawyer Cory Wong of Invictus Law said the CDRT is\xa0a court specially created for the accompanying act.\nSimilar to the Small Claims Tribunal, the CDRT allows for simplified court processes with minimal fees, and is meant to provide easy access to the man on the street for such cases, he said.\xa0\nHowever, a trade-off means that parties cannot be represented by lawyers in the CDRT.\nAfter satisfying the legal requirement that states a neighbour is someone who lives in the same building\xa0or within 100m of the complainant, the next question is whether the interference is unreasonable and whether there is evidence to prove it, he said.\nThere are different types of ""unreasonableness"" and evidence to prove it depending on the type of interference. For example, noise disturbances will typically involve audio recordings and audiometers to record the loudness of the noise, but soft ambient noises that affect rest can also form a case.\nIf a person has evidence of the unreasonable interference, they can apply under the CDRA for various court orders: For damages such as compensation, injunctions such as a restraining order, specific performance such as compelling the neighbour to do certain things, apologies, or any necessary order.\n\n\nWhether the court will grant the order is subject to factors such as the outcome of mediation between the parties, whether the evidence is sufficient, the impact on the neighbour, the tolerance level of a reasonable person living in Singapore, and whether it is fair to grant such a court order.\nIf the court order is granted and the neighbour complies, all is well, said Mr\xa0Wong of Invictus Law.\nBut if the neighbour disobeys the order, the resident can apply to the court for a special direction for the neighbour to comply with the disobeyed order. A breach of such a special direction can be punished with jail of up to three months, a fine of up to S$5,000, or both.\nIf the neighbour disregards this special direction as well, the resident can apply for an exclusion order for the neighbour to be excluded from his or her home. The granting of such an order is subject to very strict requirements, Mr Wong added, especially the impact on the neighbour and whether it is fair to grant such an order.\nBreaching an exclusion order can be punished with up to three months\' jail, a fine of up to S$5,000, or both.\nARE MOST DISPUTES RESOLVED?\nHowever, Mr Wong said most of his firm\'s neighbour-dispute consultations did not go beyond the initial court order. Referring to the piano-playing incident, he said it ""is certainly not a stretch to say that the reasonable person would definitely think twice about playing the piano loudly at home if it could attract a fine or jail time pursuant to a court order"".\nMr Joel Wong from Eugene Thuraisingam, LLP, said whether getting a stiff penalty in court is enough to stop a neighbour depends on their personality and demeanour.\n""In general, yes - an adverse court ruling is likely to deter the neighbour from causing further nuisance,"" he said.\nMr Lim gave a practical tip for the resident to keep a detailed and contemporaneous record of each and every nuisance act.\n“The record should state the date, time, and description of the nature and severity of each incident, together with photographs, audio or video recordings and CCTV footage where appropriate,” he said.\xa0\n“This is known as the evidence gathering process, and is an often overlooked aspect when a complainant is in the midst of a heated dispute and emotions are running high. This body of evidence is important as it will substantiate the complainant’s claims in court, if matters reach that stage.”\nHowever, he said one issue is the perception of the time that the court process may take to “solve the problem”.\xa0\n“It may seem ineffective to a neighbour on the receiving end of daily nuisance acts, whilst legal proceedings take their course in court,” he said. “Ultimately, the reality is that court sanctions or penalties may deepen divisions between neighbours and further deteriorate the already sour neighbourly relationship.”\xa0\nHe added: “It is not difficult to imagine a scenario where a neighbour who is unhappy with the court outcome may commit other anti-social acts in order to ‘get back’ at the complainant or otherwise antagonise the complainant.\xa0\n""While the law plays an important role in punishing undesirable behaviour, a holistic approach of building a strong community ethic and neighbourly spirit is required to address the problem of nuisance neighbours.”\nThe spokesperson for the Law Ministry\xa0said “a good degree of understanding, consideration and compromise goes a long way towards maintaining harmonious neighbour relations”.\xa0“We encourage everyone to be more considerate towards one another, and communicate with their neighbours before disputes arise,” she said.\n', 'related_topics': ['     law ']}"

      Ex-bus driver's lawsuit against SBS Transit for unfair work practices to be heard in High Court
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: A judge has granted a bid by a former bus driver to have his case against SBS Transit for\xa0allegedly unfair work practices – including long work hours and unpaid overtime –\xa0heard in the High Court.\nJustice Audrey Lim said in a written judgment released on Thursday (Jun 10) that the case raises important questions of law to warrant the move to the higher court from the Magistrate\'s Courts.\nAlthough the case was mounted by one bus driver, Mr Chua Qwong Meng, another 12 drivers are linked to it. Mr Chua claims that about S$720,000 is involved in the allegations of all 13 suits, which include unpaid overtime fees and contentions on the maximum consecutive number of work days allowed.\nThe case affects not only the bus driver in the case but a larger class of employees including those in the public transport sector, said the judge.\nLawyer M Ravi represented Mr Chua and the other 12 bus drivers, while SBS Transit was represented by a team of lawyers led by Senior Counsel Davinder Singh.\nMr Chua worked for SBS Transit from April 2017 to early 2020. He commenced his suit against the company for breaches of contract and provisions of the Employment Act on Sep 20, 2019.\xa0\nFour other bus drivers commenced similar proceedings in the Magistrates\' Courts that same day, and another eight drivers launched their own suits subsequently.\nIn total, 13 bus drivers are suing SBS Transit over what the judge said are essentially the same matters pertaining to their employment.\nThey are: Mr Chua, Mr Lee Chye Chong, Mr Chian Poh Seng, Mr Fung Chean Seng, Mr Tan Ting Hock Robin, Mr Thiyagu Balan, Mr GAn Kim Kiam, Mr Huzainal Hussein, Mr Lim You Onn, Mr Chiew Yi Yee, Mr Meerah Mohamed Halideen, Mr Razak Hasim and Mr Mohamad Sani Din.\nIt was agreed on Mar 4 last year that Mr Chua\'s case would be heard as a test case, with the other 12 suits held in abeyance pending the determination of his case.\n\n\nMR CHUA\'S CLAIMS\nMr Chua claims that SBS Transit breached the Employment Act by not giving him a rest day per week. Its employment practices were also allegedly in breach of the Manpower Ministry\'s regulated pay rate that an employer is expected to pay for work done during a rest day.\nMr Chua also claims that he was underpaid for overtime work, and that the company did not pay him the statutorily prescribed rate for working on a rest day.\nAs a result, he worked in excess of the prescribed work hours in a day or week. He also claims that the company did not\xa0pay him an agreed allowance for work done on the night shift.\nSBS Transit denies the claims and asserts that it has complied with contractual obligations and laws, rules or regulations on working hours, overtime pay and rest days.\nIt claims that it compensated Mr Chua in compliance with his employment contract, which started in 2017, as well as with the law and the Manpower Ministry\'s guidelines.\nMR RAVI\'S ARGUMENTS, AND MR DAVINDER SINGH\'S\nMr Ravi argued for the case to be transferred to the High Court as it involves an important question of law and is a test case.\nHe said the questions of law - which include how ""rest days"" are interpreted and whether an employee can work for 12 consecutive days over a 14-day period - will impact not only the plaintiffs but the whole of the employment sector in Singapore.\nThe 13 suits amount to S$720,000, which is beyond the district court\'s limit, he said.\nMr Singh objected to having the case heard in the High Court, claiming abuse of court process and saying there is no important question of law.\nHe said there is nothing to suggest that the issues raise difficult or complex issues. The State Courts regularly deal with disputes involving the interpretation of employment agreements and the provisions of the Employment Act, he added.\nHe said Mr Chua has not shown credible evidence that damages in his suit would exceed S$250,000, the jurisdictional limit of the district court.\nJustice Lim said an important question of law need not necessarily be a complex or difficult one, and that just because the State Courts deal with employment disputes does not mean there may not be important questions of law in the provisions of the Employment Act.\nShe found that the questions of law in this case are important ones which affect a larger class of employees, pointing to how 12 other drivers filed similar suits.\n""The Employment Act provides for mandated rest days and limits to hours of work (among other matters) to protect the rights of employees,"" she said.\n""The question of whether this can be \'overridden\' in a case where an employee is deemed to provide essential services, which on its face may not look like a difficult question, is important as it affects a larger population of workers in general,"" the judge\xa0said.\xa0\nThe case would have potential\xa0ramifications on how such contracts are structured in terms of granting days off, computing overtime pay and determining work hours, she added.\nIn a statement, SBS Transit said it respects Justice Lim\'s decision and ""will continue to vigorously contest the bus captains’ claims in the High Court"".\nThe case will be heard at a later date.\n', 'related_topics': ['     law ', '     employment ', '     SBS Transit ']}"

      Australia antitrust boss rejects claim big tech law is a favour for News Corp
  </h1>, 'text': 'SYDNEY: The architect of Australia\'s new law making Alphabet Inc\'s Google and Facebook Inc pay news outlets for content on Thursday rejected a suggestion the move was the result of lobbying by News Corp, calling the claim ""extremely strange"".\nAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) chair Rod Sims, who oversaw drafting of the law, acknowledged the negotiating system was proposed by the Rupert Murdoch-controlled publisher but said all major media operators in the country supported it.\nAsked at an FT conference in Britain if Australia had acted at the behest of News Corp, Sims said Google had ""sent emails to all parliamentarians saying \'don\'t let big business control the internet\', and they were of course referring to News Corp.""\n""News Corp is 1per cent the size of Google. News Corp is one of four main media companies (in Australia). It\'s very likely not the one with the biggest reach.

This whole notion that this is about News Corp is extremely strange.""\nRepresentatives of Google and News Corp in Australia were not immediately available for comment. Some critics of the new media law have suggested that the Australian government acted because of lobbying by powerful media interests including News Corp.\nAustralia in February passed laws that make the Big Tech players such as Google and Facebook pay media companies for content on their platforms. If the online giants and media companies can\'t strike a deal, the government appoints an arbitrator to do it for them.\nFor months before, the U.S. tech companies mounted a vocal campaign against the law including threats to withdraw their business from the country.

      'Obamacare' survives: Supreme Court dismisses big challenge
  </h1>, 'text': 'WASHINGTON: The Supreme Court dismissed a major challenge to the Obama era health care law on Thursday, turning aside an effort by Republican-led states to throw out the law that provides insurance coverage for millions of Americans.\nThe justices, by a 7-2 vote, left the entire law intact in ruling that Texas, other GOP-led states and two individuals had no right to bring their lawsuit in federal court. The Biden administration says 31 million people have health insurance because of the law popularly known as “Obamacare.”\nThe law’s major provisions include protections for people with pre-existing health conditions, a range of no-cost preventive services and the expansion of the Medicaid program that insures lower-income people, including those who work in jobs that don’t pay much or provide health insurance.\nAlso left in place is the law’s now-toothless requirement that people have health insurance or pay a penalty. Congress rendered that provision irrelevant in 2017 when it reduced the penalty to zero.\nThe elimination of the penalty had become the hook that Texas and other Republican-led states, as well as the Trump administration, used to attack the entire law. They argued that without the mandate, a pillar of the law when it was passed in 2010, the rest of the law should fall, too.\nAnd with a more conservative Supreme Court that includes three Trump appointees, opponents of Obamacare hoped a majority of the justices would finally kill off the law they have been fighting against for more than a decade.\nBut the third major attack on the law at the Supreme Court ended the way the first two did, with a majority of the court rebuffing efforts to gut the law or get rid of it altogether.\nTrump’s three appointees to the Supreme Court -\xa0Justices Amy Coney Barrett, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh -\xa0split their votes. Kavanaugh and Barrett joined the majority. Gorsuch was in dissent, signing on to an opinion from Justice Samuel Alito.\nJustice Stephen Breyer wrote for the court that the states and people who filed a federal lawsuit “have failed to show that they have standing to attack as unconstitutional the Act’s minimum essential coverage provision.”\nIn dissent, Alito wrote, “Today’s decision is the third instalment in our epic Affordable Care Act trilogy, and it follows the same pattern as instalments one and two. In all three episodes, with the Affordable Care Act facing a serious threat, the Court has pulled off an improbable rescue.” Alito was a dissenter in the two earlier cases, as well.\nLike Alito, Justice Clarence Thomas was in dissent in the two earlier cases, but he joined Thursday\'s majority, writing, “Although this Court has erred twice before in cases involving the Affordable Care Act, it does not err today.""\n\n\nBecause it dismissed the case for the plaintiff\'s lack of legal standing -\xa0the ability to sue -\xa0the court didn\'t actually rule on whether the individual mandate is unconstitutional now that there is no penalty for forgoing insurance. Lower courts had struck down the mandate, in rulings that were wiped away by the Supreme Court decision.\nWith the latest ruling, the ACA is “here to stay for the foreseeable future,” said Larry Levitt, an executive vice president for the non-profit Kaiser Family Foundation, which studies health care.\n“Democrats are in charge and they have made reinvigorating and building on the ACA a key priority,” Levitt said. “Republicans don’t seem to have much enthusiasm for continuing to try to overturn the law.”\nRepublicans pressed their argument to invalidate the whole law even though congressional efforts to rip out the entire law “root and branch,” in Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell’s words, have failed. The closest they came was in July 2017 when Arizona Sen. John McCain, who died the following year, delivered a dramatic thumbs-down vote to a repeal effort by fellow Republicans.\nChief Justice John Roberts said during arguments in November that it seemed the law’s foes were asking the court to do work best left to the political branches of government.\nThe court’s decision preserves benefits that became part of the fabric of the nation’s health care system.\nPolls show that the 2010 health care law grew in popularity as it endured the heaviest assault. In December 2016, just before Obama left office and Trump swept in calling the ACA a “disaster,” 46 per cent of Americans had an unfavourable view of the law, while 43 per cent approved, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation tracking poll. Those ratings flipped and by February of this year 54 per cent had a favourable view, while disapproval had fallen to 39 per cent in the same ongoing poll.\nThe health law is now undergoing an expansion under President Joe Biden, who sees it as the foundation for moving the US\xa0to coverage for all. His giant COVID-19 relief bill significantly increased subsidies for private health plans offered through the ACA’s insurance markets, while also dangling higher federal payments before the dozen states that have declined the law’s Medicaid expansion. About 1 million people have signed up with HealthCare.gov since Biden reopened enrolment amid high levels of COVID cases earlier this year.\n\n\nMost of the people with insurance because of the law have it through Medicaid expansion or the health insurance markets that offer subsidized private plans. But its most popular benefit is protection for people with pre-existing medical conditions. They cannot be turned down for coverage on account of health problems, or charged a higher premium. While those covered under employer plans already had such protections, “Obamacare” guaranteed them for people buying individual policies.\nAnother hugely popular benefit allowed young adults to remain on their parents’ health insurance until they turn 26. Before the law, going without medical coverage was akin to a rite of passage for people in their 20s getting a start in the world.\nBecause of the ACA, most privately insured women receive birth control free of charge. It’s considered a preventive benefit covered at no additional cost to the patient. So are routine screenings for cancer and other conditions.\nFor Medicare recipients, “Obamacare” also improved preventive care, and more importantly, closed a prescription drug coverage gap of several thousand dollars that was known as the “doughnut hole.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     news and politics ', '     law ', '     Supreme Court ', '     US ']}"

      Parti Liyani's application for S$10,000 compensation against the AGC dismissed by High Court
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Ms Parti Liyani, who was acquitted last year of theft, had her application for compensation of\xa0S$10,000 against\xa0the Attorney-General\'s Chambers (AGC)\xa0dismissed by the High Court on Monday (Jun 21).\nShe sought compensation for losses\xa0after her conviction for theft was overturned upon appeal and she was acquitted in September last year.\xa0\nThe Indonesian woman, a former domestic worker, was initially\xa0found guilty in March 2019 of\xa0stealing more than S$30,000 worth of valuables from former Changi Airport Group chairman Liew Mun Leong and his family when she was working for them.\nHigh Court judge Justice Chan Seng Onn overturned the conviction\xa0and acquitted her of all charges in September\xa0last year upon her appeal.\xa0\xa0\nAfter the acquittal,\xa0Ms Parti\xa0sought a compensation order in the High Court. Ms Parti applied to be compensated for the statutory maximum of S$10,000 under Section 359(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code.\n\n\nOn Monday, Justice Chan dismissed her compensation application, and said\xa0that\xa0she had not succeeded in proving, on a balance of probabilities, that the prosecution against her was “frivolous or vexatious”.\nHe also said in his judgment that the decision to bring the charges against Ms Parti was based on ""sufficient evidence such that there is a case fit to bring before the court"".\xa0\n""After considering the parties’ submissions, I accept the prosecution’s submission that there was sufficient evidence at the commencement of proceedings such that there was a case fit to be tried before the court,"" said Justice Chan.\nUnder the Criminal Procedure Code, if an accused person is acquitted of any charge for any offence, and if it is proven that the prosecution was frivolous or vexatious, the court ""may order the prosecution or the complainant or the person on whose information the prosecution was instituted to pay as compensation to the accused a sum not exceeding S$10,000"".\nThis is the first application for compensation against the prosecution under Section 359(3)\xa0of the Criminal Procedure Code that has come before the Singapore courts, said Justice Chan in his judgment.\xa0The section was enacted\xa0in 2010.\nASSERTIONS MADE FAILED TO MEET “HIGH THRESHOLD”\nJustice Chan said that the assertions made by Ms Parti may be categorised into three groups: Assertions against the prosecutor’s conduct of the proceedings;\xa0assertions against the sufficiency of evidence supporting the commencement and continuation of her prosecution; and assertions of malice or dishonesty.\n“On the merits, the court held that the assertions made failed to meet the high threshold for establishing that (Ms) Parti’s prosecution was frivolous or vexatious,” he said.\nJustice Chan said the assertion that the prosecution against Ms Parti was “frivolous or vexatious” is a “serious and grave one”.\n“Especially where malice, dishonesty or improper motives are alleged against the prosecution, the gravity of these allegations must be part of the whole range of circumstances that has to be weighed by the court when deciding as to the balance of probabilities,” he said.\nThe court held that the assertions did not show any dishonesty, malice or improper motive on the prosecution’s part to embarrass the defence, he said.\xa0\nJustice Chan added that the assertions were mainly related to Ms Parti’s ""dissatisfaction with how the deputy public prosecutors conducted the proceedings”.\n""However, this court is not the correct forum to air grievances about the deputy public prosecutors’ conduct. Mere dissatisfaction with different aspects of how the prosecutors had conducted the proceedings, even if they are numerous, will not, without more, render the prosecution \'frivolous or vexatious\',""\xa0he said.\xa0\n""After considering the cumulative effect of all of Parti’s assertions, the court found that (Ms)\xa0Parti had not proven on a balance of probability that her prosecution was frivolous or vexatious,"" Justice Chan\xa0added.\nMISCONDUCT HEARING\nIn October last year, Chief Justice\xa0Sundaresh Menon granted Ms Parti leave for an investigation to be conducted into\xa0her complaint of misconduct against two prosecutors\xa0in her theft trial.\nMs Parti alleged that Deputy Public Prosecutors Tan Yanying and Tan Wee Hao showed a ""lack of candour"" in the way they cross-examined her and presented their position to the court.\nAs a result, she was cross-examined unfairly and both she and the court were possibly misled, claimed Ms Parti.\n\n\nThe Chief Justice found that there was a prima facie case of misconduct on the evidence and that there were no relevant factors against the granting of leave.\nA disciplinary tribunal will hear the case and investigate the complaint before submitting a report to the Chief Justice.\xa0\nIf cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action is found, the Chief Justice may appoint an advocate and solicitor or a legal service officer to apply for an order to impose sanctions on the prosecutors.\nThese include censures, having them struck off the roll, prohibiting them from applying for a practising certificate for up to five years, ordering a penalty of up to S$20,000 or other punishments.\nThe case is pending.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Parti Liyani ', '     AGC ', '     law ']}"

      Debate Association Singapore says it acted fairly over sexual allegations against man who later committed suicide
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The Debate Association Singapore, which is being sued by the father of one of its ex-members, has said in defence papers that it acted fairly in its actions relating to allegations of sexual misconduct by\xa0Mr Lucas Li Guangsheng, who subsequently committed suicide.\xa0\nThe association also argued that some of the matters claimed by the father are ""scandalous, frivolous and or vexatious"" and reserved\xa0its right to get them struck out at the appropriate stage.\nThe deceased was the founding director of its Debate Development Initiative (DDI) between 2012 and 2014.\xa0He died by suicide aged 31 on Aug 8, 2018, after the association issued a public statement about allegations of sexual misconduct against him, without naming him.\n\n\nThe statement alleged inappropriate behaviour by Lucas, who represented Singapore in international debate competitions in 2005. He moderated a WhatsApp chat group called DDI Darkness, where he allegedly exchanged sexual comments with chat group participants.\nHe is also accused of pressuring a member of the group to exchange explicit photos, culminating in a sexual encounter that he initiated.\nA day before Lucas\' suicide, the association\'s executive committee (EXCO)\xa0issued a statement titled ""Allegations of Misconduct Against A Former Director of the Debate Development Initiative"" on its website and the Singapore Debaters\' Facebook page.\nThe statement said that the EXCO had decided to file a police report and to permanently ban the ex-director from all events held by the association as well as to notify partner organisations to prevent him from entering any competitions or camps he co-organised.\nLucas\' father, Mr Lawrence Li See Kit, launched a lawsuit against the association earlier this year, claiming negligence in the way they handled investigations and the publication of allegations against his son.\nHe alleges that their actions led to his son\'s suicide when they knew he suffered from depression. He also points to the president of the association\'s EXCO at the time, Ms Cherylyn Wee, claiming that she pressured the other members to take action against his son.\nHe claims that Ms Wee had ""a strained relationship"" with Lucas, was ""resentful"" of his role or influence and ""instigated"" investigations against him.\nASSOCIATION ACTED FAIRLY: LAWYERS\nThe association\'s lawyers, Mr Darren Tan and Mr Joshua Tan from Invictus Law, said it had acted fairly, bona fide and without any bias or predetermination in filing a police report, banning Lucas from events and alerting partner organisations.\nThey said in papers seen by CNA that the association was entitled to rely on an audit report at a July 2018 EXCO meeting.

      New Bill aims to set out tougher maximum punishments for 3 sex crimes
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: A new Bill tabled in Parliament on Monday (Aug 2) is proposing tougher maximum penalties for three types of sexual offences, among other changes to the Penal Code.\nThe proposed harsher punishments would see maximum jail terms raised by a year for molestation and two other sexual offences involving minors.\nThe potential changes were first announced by Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam in March, after a review of penalties for hurt and sexual offences was completed in February.\n\n\nThe review had been conducted following widespread public debate over the sentencing of multiple university students for sex-related crimes, with some calls for tougher sentences.\nApart from raising penalties for some of these crimes, the Criminal Law (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill will also aim to expand and clarify the scope of other offences, such as providing false information to a public servant.\nOUTRAGE OF MODESTY\nAn average of 1,190 cases of outrage of modesty were reported each year from 2016 to 2020, marking a 24 per cent increase from the previous five-year period, from 2011 to 2015, said the Law Ministry and Home Affairs Ministry in a joint release.\nCurrently, this offence is punishable with a maximum jail term of two years, a fine or caning, or a combination of these.\nTo “enhance deterrence and allow the courts to deal with egregious cases more severely”, the Bill is aiming to increase the maximum jail term for molestation from two years to three years.\nSEXUAL OFFENCES INVOLVING MINORS\nThe Bill is also seeking harsher punishments for engaging in sexual activity in the presence of a minor, aged between 14 and 16, or causing them to view a sexual image – and for similar activities done in front of a minor aged between 16 and 18.\nIt aims to raise maximum jail terms for these from one to two years.\nThe ministries said this will “ensure parity with similar offences involving sexual communication with minors of the same age ranges … which carry a maximum imprisonment term of two years.”\nPROVIDING FALSE INFORMATION TO A PUBLIC SERVANT\nIn addition, the Bill aims to expand and clarify certain parts of the Penal Code.\nOne such section involves giving false information to a public servant with the intent of causing, or knowing that it will likely cause, the public servant to improperly use, or not to use, his lawful powers.\nBut this section does not apply if a person does so to cause the public servant to be “ineffective or inefficient in exercising his lawful powers”, said the ministries.\nAn example, they noted, would be if someone misled the police about a suspect’s identity, causing them to have to put in more time and effort to uncover this identity.\nIn a recent case, an offender falsely told the police that he did not know the suspect of the case – causing the police spend more than 21 extra man-hours uncovering the suspect’s identity.\n“This is not just a matter of wasting police resources, but also compromising public safety; if the suspect remains at large, he could commit more offences, leading to more victims,” noted the ministries, adding that changes under the Bill would help cover such scenarios.\nAnother amendment involves clarifying that voluntarily obstructing public servants from carrying out their public functions can arise from providing false information – rather than just physically obstructing them.\nThe Bill aims to raise maximum jail terms for this offence from three months to six months, to align the penalty with a similar offence under another section of the Penal Code.\nCLARIFYING OTHER SEXUAL OFFENCES\nIt is currently an offence for someone to get sexual consent by deceiving the victim about the use of any sexually protective measure, or about whether the person engaging in sexual activity with the victim has a sexually transmitted disease (STD).\nThe Bill aims to broaden the scope of the offence in a few ways, such as covering deception about the risk of the victim getting an STD. This includes, for instance, if an offender lies to the victim that the offender’s STD is not transmissible via sexual activity.\nIn addition, the Bill seeks to clarify terms relating to “child abuse material” and “abusive material”. These are currently defined to include “material depicting minors’ breasts, or their genital or anal regions, in circumstances which reasonable persons would consider offensive”.\n\n\nA proposed clarification is that these body parts may be either “exposed or covered”.\n“This ensures that the offences will cover photographs of scantily clad minors; or close-up photos of minors’ genitals, buttocks, or breasts even if they are covered by clothing, in circumstances which reasonable persons would regard as sexually offensive,” the ministries said. Another clarification is that these depictions must be sexual in nature.\nThe Bill will also clarify the offence of sexually penetrating a corpse. Currently, the law only prohibits a man from penetrating a corpse’s vagina, anus or mouth with his penis; or anyone from causing a man do this without his consent.\n“The Bill makes this offence gender-neutral, and expands its scope to cover other forms of sexual penetration involving corpses,” said the ministries.\nFinally, the Bill hopes to replace certain “archaic terms” - such as “wantonly”, “malignantly” - with ones that are more easily understood (“rashly”, “intentionally”), said the ministries.\nIt will be up for a second reading in Parliament in September.\n', 'related_topics': ['     MHA ', '     crime ', '     law ']}"

We need to ensure that such like minded offenders will be strongly deterred from harming them.”\nIn response to Mr Pillai, Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam said that “there was no reason to raise the age limit” in his closing remarks.\xa0\n“The proportion or number of men over the age of 50 arrested for serious offences that attract caning are significantly lower compared to men under the age of 50 … (Mr Pillai) raised the concern of offenders who are near the age of 50 delaying the proceedings to escape caning. Raising the age limit by itself may not stop the problem because when you shift the line, the problem may also shift,” he added.\xa0\nOther concerns related to sexual offences were also raised in Parliament during the second reading.\xa0\nNominated MP Raj Joshua Thomas proposed the Government “commence a study of whether the identities of persons accused of sexual crimes should be published until they have been convicted and exhausted all avenues of appeal”.\xa0\xa0\n“The recent case of Dr Yeo Sow Nam who obtained a discharge amounting to acquittal illustrates how an innocent person can have his name sullied, and suffer public and long-term stigma which affects not only his professional life, but also his personal life,” he said.\xa0\n“This category of crimes leave a particular stain on how a person is viewed by the public, even if that person is ultimately found not guilty or discharged.”\xa0\nMP Sharael Taha (PAP - Pasir Ris-Punggol) added that “while we support harsher sentences, we must also protect the wrongly accused”.\xa0\n“The nature of sexual offences is such that it takes a lot of courage for a victim to proceed in making a report … It is because of this mental anguish, on top of any physical harm and abuse that has already occurred, that perpetrators must be brought to justice. However, it should not be abused by the very few who out of spite or mischief decide to lodge such reports,” he said.\xa0\nIn response to the Mr Thomas and Mr Sharael, Mr Shanmugam said that the Government\'s current approach is open court proceedings.\n""It\'s not set in stone, and we will keep the position under review. But as of today, as of now, the current position is open court proceedings ... Overall, the question is what helps in advancing, in maintaining rule of law and the justice system,"" he said.\xa0\n""Mr Sharael\xa0commented that the criminal justice system should not be abused by persons who lodge false reports out of spite or mischief. We agree. And it\'s an offence to make false allegations in court or lodge false police reports. Persons who are convicted of\xa0making false reports could face severe penalties.""\nIn addition, the Bill will expand and clarify the scope of certain offences and defences.\nOne such offence involves giving false information to a public servant with the intent of causing, or knowing that it will likely cause, that person to improperly use, or not to use, his lawful powers.\nUnder the Bill, the amendment “makes clear that the act of giving of false information to a public servant can amount to obstruction, even if there was no physical obstruction or use of threats”, said Minister of State for Home Affairs Desmond Tan on Monday.\xa0\nThe Bill will increase the maximum imprisonment term for such an act to six months from the current three months.\xa0\xa0\nIn response to the amendments, MP Sylvia Lim (WP - Aljunied) was concerned that there was an overlap between Section 177 and Section 186 of the Penal Code, which might result in a misunderstanding by the public about the scope of the sections.\xa0\n“There now appears to be yet another overlap between offences, in that giving false information could come within Section 177, and also within Section 186. How will the police decide which section to charge a person under?” said Ms Lim.\nHowever, she noted that Section 177 states that the offender must have been under a legal duty to give information, unlike in Section 186.\xa0\n“Giving false information to a public servant when one is under a legal duty to give information is arguably more serious than when one is not under such a duty. This raises the additional question of why the maximum jail term under Section 186 is now being brought to the same level as Section 177 … from three to six months, when there is a difference in culpability,” she said.\xa0\nIn reply to Ms Lim’s concerns, Mr Shanmugam explained that under Section 177, when an individual is under a legal duty to give information to a public servant, the provision of the false information is “the central element of the offence”.\xa0\nIn contrast, Section 186 “deals with obstruction of public servants in the discharge of public functions. It can be through the provision of false information but it can also be through other means”, he said.\xa0\n“One can imagine, easily, very egregious circumstances, deliberate physical obstruction or public servants, when they are doing something extremely important and urgent, for example in the saving of lives. … The crux of the offence under Section 186 therefore, is in some way, interfering, obstructing the performance of public servants’ duties.”\xa0\nTo illustrate how the amendments to Section 186 would come into play, Mr Shanmugam highlighted a scenario where someone gives false information to the paramedics as part of a prank, with the intention to cause a delay.\xa0\xa0\n“Even though the person may not be legally bound to provide information, his act of giving false information, intentionally wasting SCDF’s time and resources in the midst of an emergency, could lead to very serious, possibly even fatal consequences,” he said.\xa0\nHowever, “the proposed amendments clarify that Section 186 is not limited to physical acts of obstruction. They could also include the provision of false information depending on the facts of each case”, he added.\xa0\nResponding to the six-month maximum jail term for individuals who obstruct public servants in their line of duty proposed under the amendments, MP Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (PAP - Chua Chu Kang) asked whether the Government would consider meting out even harsher sentences when “aggravating factors” are present.\xa0\n“For example, if the said obstruction has caused damage to public property or loss of life, compromised the safety of the officers, or even jeopardised the operational effectiveness of the mission (or) exercise,” he said.\xa0\nIn response, Mr Shanmugam said the Government “did not see a need to increase the maximum sentence based on the cases that have arisen”.\xa0\n“Some of the more egregious instances raised by the member will likely be caught by more serious offences, such as Section 353 on using criminal force to deter a public servant from discharging his duty,” he said.\xa0\nIt is currently an offence for someone to get sexual consent by deceiving the victim about the use of any sexually protective measure, or about whether the person engaging in sexual activity with the victim has a sexually transmitted disease (STD).\nThe Bill will broaden the scope of the offence in a few ways, such as covering deception about the risk of the victim getting an STD. This includes, for instance, if an offender lies to the victim that the offender’s STD is not transmissible via sexual activity.\nIn addition, the Bill will clarify terms relating to “child abuse material” and “abusive material”. These are currently defined to include “material depicting minors’ breasts, or their genital or anal regions, in circumstances which reasonable persons would consider offensive”.\nUnder the amendments, these body parts may be either “exposed or covered”.\n“This will enhance protections for minors, by ensuring that the relevant offences apply to sexual images of scantily-clad children, or close-up images of the child’s genitals, buttocks, or breasts – even if covered by clothing – in circumstances which reasonable persons would regard as offensive,” said Mr Tan.\xa0\nAnother clarification is that these depictions must be sexual in nature.\nThe Bill will also clarify the offence of sexually penetrating a corpse. Currently, the law only prohibits a man from penetrating a corpse’s vagina, anus or mouth with his penis; or anyone from causing a man to do this without his consent.\n“The proposed amendments will criminalise other forms of sexual penetration involving corpses; and make the offence gender-neutral,” said Mr Tan.\nFinally, the Bill will replace certain “archaic terms” - such as “wantonly”, “malignantly” - with ones that are more easily understood (“rashly”, “intentionally”), added Mr Tan.\nThe potential changes were first announced by Mr Shanmugam in March, after a review of penalties for hurt and sexual offences was completed in February.\nThe review had been conducted following widespread public debate over the sentencing of multiple university students for sex-related crimes, with some calls for tougher sentences.\nThe Bill was first tabled in Parliament on Aug 2.\n', 'related_topics': ['     parliament ', '     crime ', '     law ']}"

      Chief Justice orders voyeur from top UK university to be named after 11 victims pushed to lift gag order
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The Chief Justice on Friday (Sep 24) ordered that a Singaporean voyeur at a top university in the United Kingdom be named, after 11 of his victims stepped forward to push for the gag order to be lifted.\nThis comes after a long-drawn battle between the prosecutors and defence counsel Kalidass Murugaiyan to have the offender, 23-year-old Colin Chua Yi Jin, named.\nThis is a departure from usual cases involving sex offences, where gag orders are usually applied to protect the identities of victims. When the accused person is linked to the victims, the gag order can also extend to their identity although the intent is purely to protect the victims.\nChief Justice Sundaresh Menon laid out clearly the principles behind the gag order, and stated unequivocally that the accused\'s interests in this ""count for nothing"", especially after the 11 victims stated they wanted to waive their usual rights in order to have him named.\n""Really, the person who\'s asking for the gag order is your client, because he wants to take advantage of the protection that the gag order affords him,"" Chief Justice Menon told the defence lawyer.\nThe names of the victims as well as the schools they attended remain under the modified gag order and cannot be published.\nChua had pleaded guilty in July to seven charges of insulting the modesty of women and an eighth charge of possessing obscene films.\nHe took videos up women\'s skirts and of victims in the shower from 2014 to 2015 when he was in junior college in Singapore, from 2016 to 2018 when he was a full-time national serviceman, and from October 2018 when he was studying at a university in the UK.\nChua would host gatherings for his friends at his home and invite victims there but leave a video-recording device in his toilet beforehand to film them. Some of the videos wound up on pornography sites and were viewed thousands of times.\nIn total, Chua estimated the number of voyeuristic videos he filmed to be\xa0""maybe three digit"". He said he committed the offences when he felt stressed due to school or work, and felt that filming the victims ""was an addiction"" to him.\nHe filmed one 18-year-old victim after inviting her to share a hotel room with him to rest after prom night in December 2015, but filmed her showering.\nThe nude video began circulating online, and the principal of the girl\'s JC informed her about it in early 2016. The video, which shows\xa0her in her prom dress, was still circulating as of August 2020 and had been viewed at least 177,000 times.\nAnother victim was 21 when she took up Chua\'s offer for a tour of the university in the UK. She\xa0was filmed when using his toilet.\xa0\nAt Chua\'s guilty plea hearing, the prosecution and defence tussled over the lifting of the gag order, and the district judge ruled in the prosecution\'s favour, for Chua to be named.\nHowever, the defence sought a stay of the order and applied to the High Court against the decision.\nOn Friday, Chief Justice Menon opened by stating that the crux of the issue was: ""Whose interests are we protecting?""\n""We all know the reason we have to make a gag order,"" he said. ""It\'s a detraction from the principles of open justice ... there is, in a sense, another interest, which is the protection of victims.""\n""Why are we keen to protect victims? Because we don\'t want to make their punishment worse ... we don\'t want to discourage them from making reports against offenders. We don\'t want to make them afraid of invoking the ... processes of the law,"" said the Chief Justice.\n""Where the victims have come forward to say - actually, I am feeling guilty because I may not have been able to help other victims because of the gag order, and I have introduced these other victims to the offender, and I am suffering because I feel I am complicit in this by having to stay quiet, how can we logically extend the gag order in this case?"" he asked defence lawyer Mr Murugaiyan.\n""When really, the person who\'s asking for the gag order is your client, because he wants to take advantage of the protection that the gag order affords him,"" said the Chief Justice.\n""That is not the purpose of the gag order. The gag order has nothing to do with the benefit of the accused person. It is entirely driven by the protection of the victims.""\nHe added that the victims spoke ""with one voice"" and accepted the risk of being identified themselves if the accused were to be named.\n""They accept that risk, but they also want to purge the guilt and fear they had that others have suffered and may still be suffering - because of the gag order, they may not even be aware of what\'s going on. When you look at that perspective, it\'s very difficult to see how your client can even raise this application.""\nMr Murugaiyan tried arguing that not all of the victims had been unanimous at first, and said the prosecutors had ""created the appearance"" of this by withdrawing some charges.\nThere is also a 12th victim who is unknown, and who has not indicated her position, he said.\nThe Chief Justice responded that this may be true, but she was not relevant to the proceedings as she is not a witness to them.\nDeputy Public Prosecutor Nicholas Khoo called the defence\'s application a rather ""self-serving"" and ""borderline frivolous"" one, and asked for the defence to pay costs of S$2,000.\nChief Justice Menon dismissed the application by the defence against the lower court judge\'s decision to name Chua.\nHe said Chua was ""seeking only his own benefit"" in a case ""advanced in the guise of protecting"" either existing victims or other unknown victims.\nHe ordered Chua to pay costs of S$2,000 for his motion.\nChua has not yet been sentenced, but a district court heard on Monday that he was found not suitable for probation. He will next return to court in October.\n', 'related_topics': ['     crime ', '     gag orders ', '     law ']}"

      Falsehoods, freedom of speech and burden of proof: Key findings from Apex Court's landmark POFMA judgment
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The Court of Appeal has allowed part of the Singapore Democratic Party\'s (SDP\'s) appeal against correction directions the Manpower Ministry issued to the political party under the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA).\nIn the landmark judgment released on Friday (Oct 8), the Apex Court set out its stand on related issues stemming from the controversial piece of legislation for the first time since it came into force in October 2019.\nHere are some of the key findings from the judgment, which tackled both the SDP appeal and a separate appeal by The Online Citizen on POFMA.\nThe purpose of POFMA is, among other things, ""to prevent the communication of false statements of fact in Singapore and to enable measures to be taken to counteract the effects of such communication"", and ""to suppress ... support of online locations that repeatedly communicate false statements of fact in Singapore"".\nChief Justice Sundaresh Menon cited the Minister of Law\'s explanation that POFMA is the Legislature\'s response to the threat of ""a serious loss of trust in governments, in institutions, both public and private"", and a ""weakening of the infrastructure of fact"" caused by ""falsehoods spread through new media"".\nHe found that there was ""no merit"" to SDP\'s argument that Parliament did not specifically consider whether restricting the right to free speech was ""necessary or expedient"" to achieve or protect public order.\n""We are therefore satisfied, from our examination of the legislative material, that Parliament did consider the POFMA to be necessitated by concerns, at least, of national security and public order,"" the court found.\nThe court established a five-step framework that a court has to determine if someone applies to set aside a correction direction issued under POFMA.\nFirst, the court should start with the subject statement identified as false by the relevant minister. The court must identify what is the statement that the minister wishes to target by his correction direction.\nSecond, the court should determine whether the subject material being targeted makes or contains the subject statement identified by the minister, as understood according to the minister\'s intended meaning. The court should consider whether the minister\'s interpretation is a reasonable one. If the court finds that the subject material does not contain the subject statement identified by the minister, then the correction direction may be set aside.\nThird, the court should determine if the identified subject statement is a ""statement of fact"" as defined under the POFMA.\nFourth, the court should determine if the identified subject statement is ""false"" in the sense explained in the relevant section of POFMA.\nFifth, the court should consider if the subject statement ""has been or is being communicated in Singapore"" according to POFMA.\nBoth the SDP and TOC argued that the burden of proof in applications to set aside correction directions issued under POFMA should lie on the Attorney-General, and that it should fall on\xa0the AG to justify the issuance of the correction directions. It should not fall on the statement-maker to show that the correction directions ought not to have been issued.\nIn considering the matter, the court looked at the structure of POFMA and the wording of its provisions. Two conditions must be satisfied before a correction direction may be issued: First, there must be a false statement of fact that has been communicated in Singapore, and second, the minister is of the opinion that it is in the public interest to issue a correction direction.\nThe court found that the answer to the question of burden of proof must stem from an understanding of the true nature of the procedure for setting aside a correction direction. The appellants SDP and TOC misunderstood the significance of the terms ""appeal"" and ""rehearing"" under POFMA, the court found.\nThe procedure for an ""appeal"" under POFMA is not in the sense of a superior court\'s appellate review of the decision of a lower court or tribunal, but rather a statutory mechanism specially provided under POFMA so an appellant dissatisfied with a correction direction can directly challenge the minister\'s direction.\nThis statutory mechanism is unique, and an avenue for challenging an executive decision, so the submission that the burden of proof must lie on the minister does not sit well with the nature of this statutory mechanism, the court found.\nThe court gave at least three reasons why the burden of proof should lie from the outset on the recipient of the correction directions.\nFirst, as in the case of judicial review proceedings, it is inconsistent with the administrative law presumption of the legality of executive action to allow an applicant to mount a challenge to a minister\'s issuance of a correction direction without putting forward any basis for the challenge.\nThe court cited a previous judgment that presumed constitutional office holders and other officials exercise their public functions in conformity with the law, and it is for any party alleging otherwise to adduce evidence at the outset to rebut this presumption.\nSecond, placing the burden of proof on the minister without requiring the recipient of the correction direction to show some objective basis for his complaint opens the way for abuse. This means a person can make any false allegation and then go to court, requiring the minister to prove that they have satisfied the legal requirements for issuing a correction direction.\nThird, the minister is required to set out in a correction direction the basis on which the subject statement is determined to be a false statement of fact. This extends to the grounds for the assertion that it is false. Since the minister must provide his grounds on why the statement is regarded as false, the recipient of the direction who wants to challenge those grounds must explain why it challenges them.\nHowever, the court found that a person challenging a correction direction would just have to show a prima facie case that one or more of the grounds for having the direction set aside is satisfied.\nIf the person cannot even establish this, his application would fail at the threshold.\nConversely, if the person can cross this threshold, the evidential burden will then shift to the minister to show that none of the grounds the person challenging the direction rely upon are made out.\nWhether the minister proves this will depend on all the circumstances, including the content of the subject statement, the types or sources of information or knowledge relied on, the investigations undertaken and the pertinent data.\nThe final determination will be made by the court based on the totality of evidence shown by all parties.\nTOC was issued a correction direction by the Minister of Home Affairs on Jan 22 for an article it published based on a press statement by Malaysian non-governmental organisation Lawyers for Liberty (LFL), which alleged that illegal hanging methods were used in Singapore\'s Changi Prison.\nMHA refuted the allegations as ""untrue, baseless and preposterous"", and said any acts as those described in the article would have been thoroughly investigated and dealt with.\nTOC argued it was merely reporting the fact that LFL made those allegations, and did not endorse the allegations themselves.\n""This is a point of importance,"" the court found. ""While TOC\'s argument may be superficially attractive, it overlooks the fact that the legislative imperatives underlying the POFMA are focused on the deleterious effects of online falsehoods and seek, specifically, to safeguard the infrastructure of fact as well as to protect the Government and other key institutions from breakdowns of trust engendered by the proliferation of such falsehoods.""\n""In our judgment, this cuts against an approach which prevents the court from considering the falsity of a statement on the basis of its being read out of context because statements that are rendered false when they are reasonably understood in a particular way ... can conceivably cause the very harm that the POFMA was enacted to address,"" said the Chief Justice.\nHe gave an example of a ""clickbait"" article that uses deceptive headlines to attract attention, but where the headlines turn out to be correct when read carefully with the article.\nHowever, a reader may nonetheless be misled by the headline and misconstrue it in a way that renders it false, and this could potentially affect public order. This is a matter to be assessed on the facts of each individual case, but exposes the flaw in TOC\'s argument that speech that is false because it is taken out of context is harmless to public order, the court found.\nThe court upheld that POFMA is constitutional, but noted there is ""considerable public benefit"" in assessing the constitutionality of POFMA, as this is the first case before the Court of Appeal concerning POFMA\'s interpretation and application.\nSDP argued that parts of POFMA are unconstitutional as they limit the right to freedom of speech, but the Attorney-General argued that false speech does not even attract protection under the Constitution.\nChief Justice Sundaresh Menon, who delivered the judgment, said the Constitution confers on every Singapore citizen the right to freedom of speech and expression, but noted the tendency to assume that any type of speech is constitutionally protected.\nUnder POFMA, a person who receives a correction direction must comply with it even before any court proceedings are brought to challenge the issuance of the direction.\n""The question then is whether speech that is considered by the minister to constitute a false statement of fact, but that has yet to be proven to be so in a court of law, is nonetheless protected from restriction by (the relevant article) of the Constitution,"" said Chief Justice Menon.\nThe AG argued that a falsehood remains a falsehood ""even before a judicial determination of its falsity"", and therefore a statement that a minister has identified as false cannot be protected under the free speech article of the Constitution.\n""With respect, this is incorrect,"" said the Chief Justice. ""What the AG\'s submission amounts to is that a statement is a false statement of fact because the minister has identified it to be so in exercising his powers under Part 3 of the POFMA.""\n""We regard this as untenable. The minister may, after all, be mistaken. Truth and falsehood are ultimately matters to be determined by a court based on the evidence.""\nInstead, the court characterised the issuing of a correction direction under POFMA as the exercise of a power to identify statements of fact the minister regards as false, and to act upon that belief in the interest of arresting their swift online spread.\nThis assessment by the minister is subject to a final determination by the court as to whether or not it is correct, said the Chief Justice.\nUltimately, the court found that POFMA was not unconstitutional, whether in whole or in part.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Court of Appeal ', '     law ', '     POFMA ', '     SDP ', '     The Online Citizen ']}"

      After UAE law change, out-of-wedlock babies still in shadows
  </h1>, 'text': 'SHARJAH, United Arab Emirates:\xa0More than a dozen unmarried women huddled in a jail cell south of Dubai last year, locked up for the crime of giving birth, when a guard entered and declared them free.\nThe incident, described by one of the women, was among the first concrete signs that the United Arab Emirates had decriminalized premarital sex in an overhaul of its Islamic penal code.\nBut a year later, these unwed mothers remain trapped in limbo, fighting to obtain birth certificates for babies born in the shadows.\nA new law that comes into effect in two weeks still does not offer unmarried women a clear path to acquiring birth certificates for their babies. At the same time, the law criminalizes women lacking such documents.\nAlthough unwed mothers no longer face jail after the UAE legalized premarital sex in Nov 2020, they now face a maze of red tape.\nObtaining birth certificates for their babies is a costly process that the country\'s poorest residents -\xa0foreign workers who clean offices, serve food and care for the children of other mothers -\xa0cannot afford. Expats outnumber locals by nearly nine to one in the Emirates.\n“We were so full of hope,” said Star, one of those released from Sharjah Central Jail in Dec 2020 with her 3 month old daughter. “Then came trouble I didn’t think I would have the strength to get through.”\nStar gave only her first name for fear of reprisals. She and six other unmarried women, most of them Filipinas, described their legal battles to The Associated Press.\nBefore last year\'s law change, several had given birth at hospitals, where health authorities denied them birth certificates and called the police. Others withdrew to their shared apartments, scared and alone, to have their babies.\nIn the UAE, hospitals issue birth certificates only to married parents. Without the certificates, children are unable to receive medical care, attend school or travel. Their mothers, who lost work and residency during prosecution under the old law, become stranded. The number of undocumented children in the UAE is not known.\nLawyers say the obstacles stem from an enduring conservative mindset and lack of government coordination.\nSome women even yearn for the previous punishment, typically one-year detention and deportation. While terrifying, it at least guaranteed a flight home and identity documents for their children.\n“It has only gotten harder since the law changed,"" said 25-year-old mother Sitte Honey. “They won’t take you to jail and they don\'t want you to give birth,"" she added, noting abortion is also forbidden. “We\'re stuck.”\nDirar Belhoul Al Falasi, a member of the UAE\'s advisory Federal National Council, argued last year\'s decriminalization had an impact.\n“Prior to this, there was nothing in my hand to legalize what they have,” he told the AP. “But now, there is a law … that we can help them with.”\nUnder a new law that comes into force on Jan\xa02, parents who fail to document their children face a minimum of two years in prison. It makes no reference to health authorities issuing birth certificates to single mothers. The law demands that parents marry or acquire travel documents and other paperwork to prove their children’s identities, without detailing how.\nThat has stoked panic among unmarried mothers who fear further punishment.\nLast year, as lawyers scrambled to understand the opaque legal code, women like Star walked out of jail across the country. Conditions at the facilities varied and in some, mothers were separated from their children.\nStar said her daughter was taken from her during detention. She said 15 women shared a single bathroom, subsisted on only rice and bread and were let out 30 minutes each day for fresh air. Other women described police interrogations about their sexual history as deeply humiliating.\nBut after these women were freed, they still couldn\'t get the one thing they wanted most: identity documents.\nMaya, a 36-year-old mother, turned herself into authorities in Nov 2020 when she heard it would help her get a birth certificate for her 1-year-old. After several torturous weeks in Dubai’s Al Qusais Police Station, authorities became alerted to the law change and freed her. But they never granted legal status to her daughter, forcing her to ricochet from one government office to another in her quest.\n“These massive fundamental changes are highly welcome, but so much still needs to catch up,” said Ludmila Yamalova, managing partner of LYLAW, a firm taking on cases of unwed mothers.\n“Emotionally and mentally, people are not prepared to accept the law as reality,"" she added, referring to health and law enforcement agencies.\nWomen continue to raise undocumented children in secret.\nNoraida Gamama, desperate to document her 3-year-old daughter, has plastered the door of her Sharjah apartment with signs warning her half-dozen roommates to check the peephole before answering to ensure it\'s not a government official.\nLiving on expired visas and struggling to feed infants on wisps of income, many can\'t afford court fees and lawyers’ bills. It costs over US$350 to open a birth certificate petition case independently at Dubai’s Family Court.\nAnn, 36, works multiple part-time jobs, sleeping a few hours a night, to feed her undocumented 2-year-old girl. She recounted the agony of delivering her on the floor of a rented Dubai room. “All I want is to give her a name, to bring her back to the Philippines where she could live a better life,” Ann said.\nStill, a growing number of women are taking their cases to court, with mixed success. A clerk at one Dubai court said the system handled over 50 “baby cases” daily.\nWhen Honey discovered she was pregnant with her boyfriend’s child two years ago, she appealed to the Philippine Consulate to send her home. But while waiting for help that never came, baby Naya was born in her tiny apartment.\nLacking legal status after fleeing abusive employers who confiscated her passport, Honey has grown desperate to get out of Dubai. But authorities cannot repatriate her until Naya gets papers.\n“This is a nightmare. No money, no visa, no rent, no plan,"" Honey said.\nTo hasten her return, Honey\'s 47 year old mother moved to Qatar as a housemaid, pulling together the money needed to open a case in Dubai last month.\nShe’s still waiting for her first hearing and trying to get a written acknowledgement of paternity from her ex-boyfriend.\nThe process requires an unwed mother to provide a ream of personal documents, take a DNA test and testify before a judge. If the judge approves, the mother may request her child\'s birth certificate.\nSome, like Star, have persevered and made it through.\n“That kind of joy is overwhelming, to know your daughter is not illegal anymore,” Star said from her family\'s home in Davao City, Philippines. “It\'s like I\'m breathing for the first time.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     UAE ', '     law ', '     babies ']}"

      Revised edition of Singapore’s Statute Book, with simpler language of the laws, to launch end-December
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Over about six years, 30 law drafters combed through thousands of pages of Singapore’s statutes to update them and make the language more understandable to the public.\nThe process is now complete and the revised Statute Book will launch on Dec 31, comprising more than 500 Acts of Parliament in almost 27,000 pages.\nIt would be the first universal revision of Singapore’s laws since 1985. That edition, which came into force in 1987, contained 387 Acts and about 8,000 pages.\xa0\nThe revision was undertaken by the Attorney-General\'s Chambers (AGC) and the Law Revision Commission.\nThe goal was to improve its readability, so that more people may better understand the laws without having to go through a lawyer, the AGC’s Chief Legislative Counsel Jeanne Lee told CNA.\nNew and improved features include simplified and modernised language, the AGC said on Sunday (Dec 19).\n“Plain English is used as far as possible, including gender-neutral language where appropriate. Archaic words and long expressions are replaced with simpler alternatives without any change in meaning,” it added.\nThe word ""shall"", for example, is replaced with ""must"" where relevant, while a person facing a drug charge is referred to as ""the defendant"" instead of ""him"".\nThere are also streamlined and more informative citations, said the AGC, as well as a comprehensive legislative history for each revised Act.\nWhile legislative histories were provided for previous editions, the latest one comes with additional information about the progress of the Bill, amendments made to the Act over time and other details.\xa0\nInformation on predecessor Acts that were repealed is also included and presented in a diagram for a simpler understanding.\nThe initiative to revise the language of Singapore\'s laws has its genesis in the Plain Laws Understandable by Singaporeans or PLUS project that began in 2013.\xa0\nWhile the official start date for the revision was in 2017, a core of 10\xa0officers began laying the groundwork from 2015.\nThe overarching objective is to ensure that Singapore\'s laws are understandable and accessible to the public, Ms Lee told CNA.\n""We had already started to evolve our drafting style of new laws. However, revising the entire statute book was the only way we could try to update all the laws, past and present,"" she said.\xa0\nShe added that it was also timely to do so given that the last universal revision took place in 1985. Many new Acts had been enacted and existing ones extensively amended since then.\xa0\nIn the universal revision, drafters aimed to make the Acts more readable, checking cross-references, weeding out obsolete provisions, as well as having some consistency in house styles and expressions across all Acts as far as possible, Ms Lee said.\n""Laws were previously written for judges and lawyers as its main users. Latin phrases and legalese tended to be used in those contexts, but these would have been understood within the profession,"" she explained.\xa0\n""The laws could have been very detailed and prescriptive or very dense in their text. For instance, the law usually contains many conditions, qualifiers or exceptions to a general rule, and sometimes these were all packed into one sentence that ran on without a break.”\xa0\nSince the 1990s, there was a deliberate and consistent move to draft laws in a clearer and simpler way, Ms Lee added.\n""For instance, we try to express one concept per legislative sentence. We use separate provisions to set out the general rule, the conditions and the exceptions. We try to keep our sentences short and use paragraphing, avoiding convoluted expressions wherever possible.""\nPerhaps the biggest challenge in revising the legal language was to make sure the meaning of the law was not inadvertently changed, said Ms Lee.\n""This is probably the single biggest challenge in any revision because even a comma or a different placement of a word can change the meaning of a provision,"" she said.\nThe latest revision phases out the word ""shall"", which can mean different things. While it connotes an obligation most of the time and is therefore changed to ""must"", it is sometimes declaratory as in ""shall be valid"" meaning ""it is valid"".\xa0\n""The challenge was to understand the word in each context,"" said Ms Lee.\n""Along the way, we also developed a deeper appreciation of our legal heritage – due to our history, we had British laws, Indian laws, laws from the Straits Settlement government, Malaysian laws and private Ordinances,"" she said.\xa0\n""We realised that it would be a pity to lose that by modernising all the laws, so we decided to preserve the language of certain laws so that we keep the ‘voice’ of past legislation.""\nThe team of about 30 drafters faced a ""formidable"" volume of work, the scale of which they did not fully appreciate when they first began, she said.\nTracing the legislative history of each Act was another challenge, especially for the older Acts and those with predecessors that have been repealed. ""These resources are not online, and the team needed to make multiple visits to various libraries,"" said Ms Lee.\nThe other challenge was in ensuring consistency in the edits across the Acts, as there were differences in style and expression with 30 drafters working on them. To address this, they had various checklists of standard and non-standard changes, but it was not that straightforward as every edit needed to be considered in its context.\nStill, Ms Lee said the team hopes\xa0its work would help more people understand Singapore\'s laws better without needing to consult a lawyer.\n""We also hope that the legislative history provided at the back of every Act will lead to a deeper appreciation of the history of our laws,"" she said.\nThe 2020 Revised Edition will be accessible at Singapore Statutes Online and in hard copy.\nEditor\'s note: The number of officers involved in laying the initial groundwork for this project has been updated following an AGC clarification.\n', 'related_topics': ['     law ', '     AGC ']}"

      Where are the legal boundaries for OnlyFans content creators - and people who view their videos?
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE:\xa0In December, OnlyFans creator Titus Low Kaide was charged with posting obscene material on the online platform.\nThe 22-year-old was accused of uploading 32 explicit photographs and 29 videos to the online platform, and of failing to comply with an order that prohibited him from accessing his OnlyFans account.\nIf found guilty of transmitting obscene material, Low faces a jail term of up to three months and a fine. He faces another six months’ jail if convicted of failing to comply with the order.\nAfter Low was charged, some asked – is it illegal to upload adult content on OnlyFans? What about subscribers who access such content?\nLawyers CNA spoke to said subscribing to creators and consuming content on OnlyFans is not an offence. But making obscene content and uploading it is.\xa0\nUnder Section 292 of the Penal Code, it is an offence to transmit obscene material electronically in Singapore, said Ms Tania Chin, a partner at law firm Withers KhattarWong.\xa0It is also an offence under the Films Act to distribute or have an obscene film in your possession for the purposes of distributing it to others.\xa0\nBut what constitutes obscene material? Despite having gained popularity for the sexually explicit content available on the platform, there is a wide range of content on OnlyFans, and many celebrities have their own account.\xa0\nUnder Singapore law, “obscene” material includes anything that “has the tendency to deprave and corrupt the minds” of people who are likely to read, see or hear these materials, said Mr Tang Shangwei, a partner in white-collar and enforcement practice at WongPartnership LLP.\xa0\nIn deciding whether the material is obscene, the Singapore courts ask two questions: Who is likely to have access to view the material, and whether the material would “deprave and corrupt” them, he added.\xa0\n“In general and from the viewpoint of OnlyFans' subscribers, videos, photographs and/or audio recordings that depict explicit sexual activity to arouse sexual excitement would in all likelihood be considered as ‘obscene’,” said Mr Tang.\xa0\n“This is because pornography is considered as an aggravated form of obscenity.”\nHowever, what constitutes obscene material also “changes with the times”, said criminal lawyer Adrian Wee.\xa0\n“Context is everything. There are works of art hundreds of years old, which depict naked women. And no one would seriously say that that is obscene,” he told CNA.\xa0\n“But the same image in a different context may well be. So what is obscene is really contextual and with reference to the societal values or norms of that day.”\xa0\nOnlyFans is a British-run platform where creators can share photos and videos, and subscribers can access this content for a fee.\xa0\nOnlyFans requires users to be at least 18 years old, and permitted by the laws of where they are located to join the platform and view content on it. The platform also has an acceptable use policy, which prohibits creators from publishing illegal content, or content that promotes drugs, incest, bestiality or sexual assault.\nRevenge porn or content that includes or refers to those under 18 is also not allowed. Members of the public can report suspected violations of the terms of service to the platform.\xa0\nIn August 2021, the platform announced that it would ban sexually explicit content from October that year, but reversed its decision about a week later.\xa0\nOnlyFans is not banned in Singapore.\nEarlier this month, Nominated MP Dr Shahirah Abdullah filed a parliamentary question asking if the Government would consider banning the platform.\xa0\nIn a written reply last Wednesday (Jan 13), Minister for Communications and Information Josephine Teo said it is not realistic for Singapore to block all obscene content online.\n“Not all content posted on OnlyFans is objectionable, but we must ensure that such content creation platforms do not expose Singaporeans to the risk of exploitation and abuse, especially our youth,” said Mrs Teo.\xa0\nThe Government will take regulatory action “where appropriate”, she added.\xa0\n“Realistically, however, it will not be possible to block all objectionable or obscene content on the Internet. That is why we must look beyond banning and take a holistic approach to deal with such content.”\nDoes OnlyFans’ paid subscription model where viewers pay to consume content uploaded by creators make any difference in the eyes of the law?\xa0\nIt typically makes no difference for subscribers who only view the content, but it is an offence for creators of obscene material to profit off the sale of it, said lawyers. \nThis is because the viewing of obscene material itself is not an offence, although the making, keeping, distributing and selling of it is, said Withers KhattarWong’s Ms Chin.\xa0\n“Subscribing to OnlyFans in Singapore is not an offence, as there is also non-obscene material such as travel, fashion, and fitness coaching, amongst others,” said Ms Chin.\xa0\nBut if subscribers save, take screen captures of, or download obscene material from OnlyFans, they could potentially be breaching Section 30 of the Films Act for being in possession of obscene material, lawyers said.\xa0\nFor creators, it is an offence to profit off the sale of obscene material, even if viewers are paying to consume this material, they stressed.\xa0\nThe sale of obscene materials by electronic means is illegal in Singapore regardless of whether it is restricted to paid subscribers, a closed group of like-minded individuals, or even only between friends, said WongPartnership’s Mr Tang.\xa0\nFor example, in the recent “SG Nasi Lemak” Telegram chat group case, the administrators were convicted after circulating nude photographs and pornographic materials within the group, he noted.\xa0\nIn the eyes of the law, the fact that OnlyFans is a paid platform where there is commercial gain for the creator may be considered a “potential aggravating factor” when the courts are deciding on the sentence to be imposed, he added.\xa0\nFor creators in Singapore who post on OnlyFans, if their content is not obscene, there is “generally no issue” of legality, said Ms Victoria Tay, an associate at IRB Law.\n“There are no laws in Singapore prohibiting general content creation and dissemination. However, content creators should be mindful to ensure that their content does not breach any intellectual property or copyright laws, or personal data protection laws,” said Ms Tay.\xa0\n“Users should also be careful that the content they create, upload or share do not contravene racial and religious laws or are otherwise insulting and defamatory.”\xa0\nMaterials that are “objectionable” include pictures, photographs or audio recordings depicting sex, horror, crime, cruelty, violence or the consumption of drugs and other intoxicating substances, said Mr Tang.\xa0\nThe making of, sale and distribution of such materials can constitute a criminal offence, he added.\xa0\nThe consenting relationship between a subscriber and a creator who uploads photos or videos of themselves is also not considered a defence, lawyers said.\xa0\n“The legislative intent behind why consent is not a defence is not clear. In our view, it is likely to be to uphold public morality,” said senior associate at IRB Law Lydia Lee.\xa0\n“This may go to show the lawmakers' view that, even if obscene material were provided and obtained with consent, the act of transmitting obscene content still offends public morality.”\nJust like how it is illegal for the sale of pornographic DVDs from a “willing seller” to a “willing buyer”, the fact that there is consent from both the OnlyFans' creator and subscriber is not a defence to an offence involving the profiting from the transmission of obscene materials, said Mr Tang.\xa0\n“The law seeks to deter the commercial exploitation of the sale of pornographic or obscene materials and to protect the minds of the members of the public who may be tempted to purchase and expose themselves to the corrupting influence of such obscene or objectionable materials,” he added.\xa0\nAlthough it is “understandable” that creators on OnlyFans seek content that is edgy and provocative that would generate interest and attract paid viewership, this must be balanced against the risk that they would be exposed to if their content is in breach of the law, said Mr Tang.\xa0\n“The fact that the content is on the Internet, is easily uploaded and/or created, or available only to paid viewers, does not change the application of laws of the countries in which the content can be accessed,” he said.\xa0\n“More importantly, the laws continue to apply regardless of the ease by which such materials can be created, uploaded or are accessible,” he added, urging creators to be aware of the laws and regulations, and sensitive to controversial issues like race, religion and gender.\xa0\n"", 'related_topics': ['     crime ', '     law ', '     social media ']}"

      Commentary: Why shouldn’t stay-home dads who sacrificed career prospects get alimony?
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: What two things do Madonna, Kelly Clarkson and Janet Jackson have in common?\nYou’d have guessed the first one right — they’re famous American female pop stars. The second is that when they divorced, their ex-husbands got alimony from them. (Jackson married three times and she sought alimony from her latest ex-husband, a billionaire).\nFor some, the idea of a man being financially supported by a woman can rankle but this is becoming a much more common reality, right here in Singapore too. \nThe Women\'s Charter was recently amended to minimise the impact of divorce on children. Chiefly, the courts can better enforce child access orders so the parent who cares for the kids cannot deny their former spouses access to them. \nImportantly, to reduce prior acrimony when couples decide to split, a new option to divorce by mutual agreement has been included.\nBut one rousing issue brought up by Member of Parliament (PAP-Nee Soon) Carrie Tan was to rename the Women’s Charter to the Family Charter - to reflect the intention to protect men, women and children in the context of family matters and tackle the erroneous impression of a zero-sum approach that only protects women’s interests.\nMs Tan also suggested that husbands should be entitled to apply for maintenance from their wives if the distribution of labour favoured the latter’s earning potential, building on the 2016 amendments providing space for incapacitated husbands to do so.\nIn the fight for gender equality, she laid out how as a general principle, the rights, privileges, powers, capacities, duties and liabilities of a married woman should be the same as those of a married man. \nJust as society today probably expects men to shoulder household responsibilities to free women up to pursue their career expectations, such husbands who take on most care responsibilities and support their wives in earning more should be able to access maintenance post-divorce. There should be no double standards, she emphasised.\nAnd yet the amendments to the Women’s Charter were passed without these two suggestions incorporated.\nMinister of State for Social and Family Development Sun Xueling in response said: ""Renaming it now may send the wrong signal that we have somehow arrived, and so the proposal to rename the Charter should be for the future, when the social status and expectations of men and women have indeed become equal.""\nOne can’t help but feel it was a missed opportunity to set new norms of gender equality.\nThe Women’s Charter has come a long way since it was first set up in 1961 to safeguard the interests of women and children in a patriarchal society where men clearly had the upper hand.\nIn the Singapore of the 1950s, only about 20 per cent of women aged above 15 were economically active; 90 per cent of women had secondary education or less; the few who did work held mostly low-paying jobs, the rest were expected to become stay-home mums after getting married and relied on their husbands to provide for them.\nAs such, women were extremely financially vulnerable in the event of divorce — most had sacrificed their career prospects for their husbands’.\nWomen also tended to fight for custody of children but supporting them became precarious when many were not educated, had little work experience and no rainy-day funds. Strong legislation was thus necessary to address such a gendered power imbalance.\nBut times have changed and women in Singapore have made tremendous progress since. If trends in the US show almost four in 10 households have wives earning more than their husbands are indicative, this situation might be more commonplace than we think.\nThe education gender gap has narrowed — among women aged 55 and above in 2020, 22.8 per cent had post-secondary or higher qualifications, compared with 34 per cent for men.\nFor 35- to 44-year-olds, the corresponding figures were 81.8 per cent for women and 84.2 per cent for men. For 25- to 34-year-olds, it was 90.2 per cent for women and 90 per cent for men.\nSingapore’s resident female employment rate has gone from 54 per cent in 2010 to 57.7 per cent in 2020. Women hold 45.6 per cent of all PMET positions here. Singapore\'s adjusted gender pay gap narrowed from 8.8 per cent in 2002 to 4.3 per cent\xa0in 2020.\nAs more women are better educated and move into demanding careers, family dynamics change too - 52.5 per cent of married households see both husband and wife holding down jobs, while women are the sole breadwinners in 7.4 per cent of married households.\nA trend that will continue is the rise in the number of stay-home dads – this number increased from 700 in 2007, to 1,500 in 2017. \nWhat all this means is traditional care-giving roles may be shifting. \nAlimony, or maintenance, is the legal obligation a spouse has to provide financial support to the other spouse during, and even after a marriage, if the other spouse lacks the financial means to get back on their feet and support children after a divorce.\nFor example, for the spouse who was the homemaker and had given up a career to focus on the family, post-divorce, finding employment immediately is likely to be harder, especially if they had been out of the workforce for years.\nFactors affecting the quantum of the alimony awarded today include the financial needs of the claimant, the income, earning capacity, age, property ownership, financial resources, financial needs, standard of living enjoyed during the marriage, the duration of the marriage, the contributions made by each party towards the family and the care of the children, and any physical or mental disabilities of the claimant. \nThis shift to acknowledge just how gender-neutral parenting or care-giving has become is a long time coming, and omitting a further step to allow husbands to apply for alimony was a missed opportunity. \nIn 2016 the Women’s Charter was amended to create a “narrow exception” for an “incapacitated husband” (defined as being unable to earn a living or support himself due to a physical or mental disability) to seek maintenance from his wife.\nThe implication being that any married man of sound mind and body is expected to have a paying job and to support the family, if not, at the very least, himself.\nAnd the woman, even if she were in a well-paying job, or didn’t work during marriage even though she was not “incapacitated”, should be entitled to alimony should the marriage end.\nThis just goes to show how deeply-entrenched traditional gender roles are — and not just here.\nIn 1979, the US Supreme Court had already ruled that alimony is gender neutral.\nBut four decades on, as the female lawyer representing Kelly Clarkson in her high-profile divorce recently told New York Times: “What amazes me is that many bright and sophisticated women don’t realise they will have to pay (spousal support)”. \nAt the same time, people took to Twitter to call the soon-to-be-ex “Mr Clarkson” a “parasite” and an “opportunist”, and to ask “what kind of man sues his ex-wife for spousal support when he’s perfectly capable of maintaining his lifestyle on his own salary?”.\nA study by the Institute of Policy released in 2020 is another example.\nThe majority of the 21 stay-at-home fathers interviewed said they had chosen to stay home to raise their children due to the difficulty of finding jobs or having a spouse who earned more than them.\nBut they experienced “acute stigma” in the form of derisive comments from their parents-in-law, who accused them of “wasting” their potential or “mooching” off their wives.\nThe study noted there were “powerful cultural scripts” which prevent stay-at-home fathers and their breadwinning partners from embracing their respective roles. It is a pity that the Women’s Charter continues to entrench such thinking and a shame that the deeper reasons why we have demurred to make the changes not discussed.\nBut these dated beliefs extend to women too, some of whom have outdated ideas of what her other half should be earning too.\nA survey of 690 singles in Singapore by dating service LunchActually found that 87 per cent of men would date a woman who earns more than them, yet only 39 per cent of women would date a man who earns less than them.\nThe issue here is this: If women here enjoy equal access to education and career opportunities, why do they still need to date or marry a man who earns more? Why are they implicitly relying on the men to pull in more money?\nDoes this mean that many modern women still see themselves as the “default person” shouldering the majority of the “traditional” non-financial burdens of relationship maintenance, such as household chores, emotional labour, and parenting?\nI for one, would be open to a more gender-equal marriage where my partner supports me up the career ladder and is willing to mop up the hard parts of parenting.\nIf sadly, a marriage like that ends, the party who sacrificed for the family should be compensated, no different from women who gave up their careers to support husbands in previous generations.\nThat we feel men should not be entitled to apply for alimony, which the courts will adjudicate, just goes to show how far away from true gender parity we are.\nTracy Lee is a freelance writer based in Singapore who writes about food, travel, fashion and beauty.\n', 'related_topics': ['     law ', '     family and relationships ', '     gender equality ']}"

      Inside J&amp;J’s secret plan to cap litigation payouts to cancer victims
  </h1>, 'text': 'NEW YORK: Johnson & Johnson created a plan last year to limit the financial bleeding from billions of dollars in jury awards to plaintiffs who alleged the company’s Baby Powder and other talc products caused deadly cancers. The healthcare and consumer-goods giant assigned more than 30 staffers to ""Project Plato"". In a memo on the project in July, a company lawyer warned the team: Tell no one, not even your spouse.\n“It is critical that any activities related to Project Plato, including the mere fact the project exists, be kept in strict confidence,” Chris Andrew, a J&J lawyer, wrote in an internal memo reviewed by Reuters.\nThe covert team would go on to evaluate a strategy to shift all the liability from about 38,000 pending talc cases onto a newly created subsidiary, which would immediately declare bankruptcy. The goal, as a lawyer for the subsidiary said in a court filing: To halt all the litigation and transfer the cases to bankruptcy court, where plaintiffs would compete for compensation from a limited pool of money.\nIn court and in public statements last July, Johnson & Johnson said it intended to keep fighting the allegations that its products were unsafe in trial courts.\nThe company was actively defending itself in talc trials, including one that would result in a US$27 million jury award that could be nullified by the bankruptcy maneuver. The plaintiff in that case now may have to instead seek compensation through a bankruptcy process.\nPrivately, J&J took concrete steps starting as early as April to consider and plan the bankruptcy maneuver, according to internal company documents, depositions and other court records reviewed by Reuters. The strategy seeks to ensure the pending cases never reach a jury and instead be handled in a bankruptcy court.\nThe documents provide the most detailed account to date of how the New Jersey-based conglomerate strategised to limit compensation to tens of thousands of talc plaintiffs.\nReuters exclusively reported the broad outlines of the bankruptcy strategy being explored by J&J in July. The company went ahead with the plan in October, offloading responsibility for the cases to the new subsidiary, which then filed for bankruptcy.\nBefore the filing, the company faced costs from US$3.5 billion in verdicts and settlements, including one in which 22 women were awarded a judgment of more than US$2 billion, according to bankruptcy-court records.\nNow, J&J proposes to give the subsidiary in bankruptcy US$2 billion to put into a trust to compensate all 38,000 current plaintiffs, as well as all future claimants. J&J has said in court filings and in public statements that the subsidiary, LTL Management, could also tap a stream of royalty revenues valued at more than US$350 million at the time of the bankruptcy filing.\nJ&J did not answer detailed written questions from Reuters about its planning of the bankruptcy maneuver. In a statement, J&J defended the LTL bankruptcy as a way to resolve the talc claims.\n“This filing follows established process, and courts have uniformly acknowledged that equitably resolving these types of claims through Chapter 11 is a legitimate use of the restructuring process,” the statement said.\n“LTL’s objective is to reach a fair and equitable resolution for claimants through a plan of reorganisation and create a reasonable framework to address the unprecedented number of existing and future talc-related claims.”\nIt continued: “We stand behind the safety of Johnson’s Baby Powder, which is safe, does not contain asbestos and does not cause cancer. We continue to believe resolving this matter as quickly and efficiently as possible is in the best interests of claimants and all stakeholders. We will continue to follow the process and put forth our position in the court.”\nOn Thursday, a lawyer for the J&J subsidiary appeared at a bankruptcy hearing and accused attorneys for people who have sued Johnson & Johnson over its talc products of sharing confidential documents with Reuters in a ""calculated"" effort to try the case ""in the press"".\nLater Thursday, lawyers for J&J and its subsidiary sought a temporary restraining order from the bankruptcy judge to block Reuters from publishing information that, the company claims, comes from confidential documents.\nA Reuters spokesperson called J&J’s claims without merit.\n""We reject the factually-unfounded and legally-meritless claims made by J&J\'s lawyers and will continue to report without fear or favor on matters of public interest,"" the spokesperson said in a statement on Thursday.\nJ&J started secretly considering and planning the maneuver to redirect plaintiffs to bankruptcy court as early as April, when company attorneys were briefed on the strategy by lawyers at Jones Day, a firm with experience in the tactic, according to deposition testimony from an LTL lawyer.\nOn Jul 19, the day after Reuters broke the news of the strategy, a J&J official contacted Moody’s, the Wall Street ratings firm, to ask if the subsidiary bankruptcy would harm the company’s pristine credit, according to emails reviewed by Reuters. She was told it likely wouldn’t because the agency would only consider the maneuver’s impact on the finances of J&J, and not those of the subsidiary in bankruptcy.\nThe exchange underscores why the strategy was so attractive: J&J could create a related-party bankruptcy to limit liability, while avoiding “the burdens” of declaring bankruptcy itself, seven legal experts argued in an amicus brief filed with the court.\nMoody’s declined to comment.\nIn court papers, a lawyer for the J&J subsidiary said the bankruptcy filing was a ""prudent and necessary"" step that ""offered the only alternative for equitably and permanently resolving"" all the talc litigation.\nLast July, Reuters reported that one of J&J’s attorneys told plaintiffs’ lawyers that the company could pursue the bankruptcy plan, according to people familiar with the matter.\nAt the time, J&J publicly downplayed concerns about the strategy and did not confirm that it was exploring the option. “Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc has not decided on any particular course of action in this litigation other than to continue to defend the safety of talc and litigate these cases in the tort system, as the pending trials demonstrate,” the company told Reuters at the time.\nA few days later, in a California courtroom, a lawyer defending J&J against talc plaintiffs told a judge that news of the bankruptcy strategy amounted to unsubstantiated “rumours"". J&J executed the bankruptcy plan starting on Oct 11, taking the first steps to create the new subsidiary. The new company swiftly filed for Chapter 11, on Oct 14.\nThe strategy, while rare, could be adopted more widely by big companies facing liability crises if Johnson & Johnson gets bankruptcy-court approval, according to lawyers for talc plaintiffs and some legal experts. If J&J succeeds, they argue, it could provide a blueprint for Corporate America on how to circumvent jury trials involving allegations of defective products or misconduct.\nSuch a precedent could allow companies to routinely pursue related-party bankruptcies to escape accountability from juries, said Melissa Jacoby, a University of North Carolina law professor.\n“That\'s one step closer to making bankruptcy an alternative justice system for big corporations,” Jacoby said. “If a company as deeply pocketed as J&J can do this, where does it stop?”\nIn testimony last November, a lawyer for the Johnson & Johnson subsidiary said the company pursued the strategy in reaction to an onslaught of litigation with the potential for outsized jury awards. A bankruptcy court, the lawyer argued, could provide a more consistent and equitable process for compensating claimants. Johnson & Johnson has said it would provide a fair amount of money to the subsidiary to pay claims.\nJohnson & Johnson, valued at more than US$450 billion, had about US$31 billion in cash and marketable securities on hand at the end of the third quarter, securities filings show.\nThe New Jersey judge overseeing the subsidiary’s bankruptcy is scheduled on Feb 14 to begin hearing arguments on plaintiff-creditors’ contention that the bankruptcy should be dismissed because it was filed in bad faith.\nThe October bankruptcy temporarily halted the litigation against Johnson & Johnson. LTL has said it will seek to “permanently” resolve the talc litigation through a reorganisation plan that would prohibit current and future plaintiffs from seeking redress in a trial court. Instead, their claims would be directed to a trust, which would divvy up a limited amount of money through an administrative process approved by the bankruptcy court.\nJ&J’s bankruptcy strategy is the latest example of the company’s efforts to manage liability amid mounting allegations that asbestos lurks in its iconic Baby Powder and other talc products. A December 2018 Reuters investigation revealed that the company knew for decades about tests showing its talc sometimes contained carcinogenic asbestos but kept that information from regulators and the public.\nTens of thousands of plaintiffs, many with mesothelioma or ovarian cancer, have filed lawsuits alleging that exposure to talc in J&J’s Baby Powder and other company products made them sick. Records J&J produced in response to those lawsuits led plaintiff lawyers to refine their argument: The culprit wasn’t necessarily talc itself, but also asbestos in the talc.\nThat assertion, backed by decades of science showing that asbestos causes mesothelioma and is associated with ovarian and other cancers, has had mixed success in court. The company has insisted in lawsuits and public-relations campaigns that the product was safe and asbestos-free.\nOne plaintiff is Thomas McHattie, 78 years old, who travelled the world as an obstetrician-gynecologist before receiving a mesothelioma diagnosis in March 2020. McHattie said he recommended Baby Powder to “countless pregnant women” while also using it himself. McHattie said he endured five courses of chemotherapy to treat tumors in his abdomen, and has suffered from pronounced fatigue and shortness of breath.\nHe sued J&J in New York in July, a few months after receiving his diagnosis. His case had not yet gone to trial when LTL Management filed for bankruptcy.\nIn a 2020 court filing, J&J said it denied “each and every allegation, statement, matter and thing” asserted by McHattie in his lawsuit.\nMcHattie told Reuters in an interview that he was “disappointed they’ve chosen to do what is expedient and not what is right"".\n“There is no excuse for them filing a bankruptcy,” McHattie said. “Why? This is a solvent company.”\nJ&J’s subsidiary bankruptcy is one variation of a longstanding and increasingly controversial tactic of limiting liability through so-called nondebtor releases granted to companies, owners or executives. The releases can allow companies or executives to piggyback on the bankruptcies of other entities to obtain broad protection from lawsuits and restrict litigation payouts. The party receiving the release typically agrees to contribute a lump sum to the company in bankruptcy to pay off plaintiffs in exchange for an exemption from all future liability.\nThat was the case with members of the Sackler family, the billionaire owners of Purdue Pharma, which filed for bankruptcy as a hail of lawsuits alleged it had contributed to a deadly addiction epidemic with its opioid painkiller, OxyContin. In a landmark decision in December, a US district judge in New York invalidated Purdue’s bankruptcy reorganisation plan on the grounds that it improperly insulated the Sackler family from liability through nondebtor releases.\nPurdue has appealed the ruling. The company pleaded guilty in November 2020 to three felonies covering misconduct regarding its handling of opioids. Sackler family members, who also faced litigation, have denied allegations they contributed to the opioid crisis.\nJ&J’s bankruptcy takes the approach a step further. Instead of seeking releases from liability in an existing bankruptcy proceeding, the company created a bankruptcy by forming a company that plaintiff-creditors allege has no business purpose other than to limit J&J’s legal exposure.\nLawyers for talc plaintiffs contend that the J&J maneuver amounts to an abuse of the bankruptcy system, which is intended to help a struggling business reorgansze – and not to help a well-capitalised conglomerate limit legal liability for alleged wrongdoing.\n“This case is all about litigation advantage” for J&J, said Robert Stark, a Brown Rudnick lawyer representing a creditors’ committee of talc plaintiffs during a December hearing of the subsidiary’s bankruptcy.\nJ&J successfully halted the claims by tens of thousands of plaintiffs “while people are dying of cancer” and trying to prepare their families financially for their deaths, Stark said at the hearing. “It does not get more inhumane than that,” he said.\nThe Purdue and J&J bankruptcy strategies have sparked efforts in the US Congress to stop such tactics. US Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois is co-sponsoring legislation with other Democrats that would all but outlaw the strategy J&J is using and restrict the ability of companies to obtain liability releases without declaring bankruptcy themselves.\n“Our bankruptcy code and civil procedure has to be explored to make sure that this exploitation does not take place,” Durbin said in an interview.\nBusiness groups and some bankruptcy lawyers say that nondebtor releases can be an effective tool to resolve litigation to the benefit of both plaintiffs and the companies they sue. While limited amounts for compensation are often criticised, they offer plaintiffs better odds of getting paid than if they take their chances in trial courts, said Donald Workman, a Baker & Hostetler restructuring lawyer who isn’t involved in the J&J subsidiary’s case.\n“You have an elegant solution to resolve burdensome if not crushing obligations,” Workman said, that “provides funding for constituencies that might otherwise receive nothing"".\nJ&J turned to the bankruptcy plan following a series of setbacks.\nThe US Food and Drug Administration found trace amounts of asbestos in a bottle of Baby Powder purchased online, forcing the company to issue a recall in October 2019. In May 2020, the company stopped selling talc-based Baby Powder in the US and Canada, citing “misinformation” and “unfounded allegations” regarding the product\'s safety.\nIn April, J&J attorneys consulted with Jones Day lawyers, who explained how the company could use a Texas law to split the company’s consumer-product business into two parts. One would absorb all the talc liability; the other would carry on the business free from the threat of billion-dollar judgments. Texas pioneered the so-called divisional merger, which allows companies to break apart and more easily divvy up assets and liabilities among the resulting companies.\nJones Day helped Georgia-Pacific, a company owned by conglomerate Koch Industries, execute the maneuver in 2017 to offload mounting asbestos litigation. Georgia-Pacific faced allegations regarding asbestos exposure from building products that spanned decades.\nGeorgia-Pacific used the Texas law to create a new subsidiary called Bestwall to shoulder asbestos liability. As the subsidiary declared bankruptcy, the “new” Georgia-Pacific continued to produce Brawny paper towels and other lucrative brands. The maneuver came to be known in legal circles as a “Texas two-step"".\nGeorgia-Pacific paid nearly US$3 billion in dividends to Koch over the next several years, according to a court filing, that it might have been unable to dole out had it filed for bankruptcy itself. Georgia-Pacific has proposed giving Bestwall US$1 billion to settle all asbestos claims, an amount plaintiff-creditors are still challenging in bankruptcy court.\nKoch Industries and Georgia-Pacific declined to comment; Jones Day did not respond to a request for comment.\nWhen J&J needed help last year, it hired Dallas-based Jones Day partner Greg Gordon and other members of the firm’s Georgia-Pacific legal team.\nAs the bankruptcy planning moved forward, a major court defeat heightened the urgency. In June of last year, J&J lost a bid to reverse a watershed verdict in favor of 22 women who blamed their ovarian cancer on Baby Powder and other talc products. The women had initially won a verdict of US$4.69 billion from a Missouri jury. A state appeals court reduced the award to more than US$2 billion.\nBy July 12, the company had secretly set up the Project Plato team. The more than 30 employees staffing it came from J&J’s finance, risk management, tax and business development operations, according to the internal J&J memo and deposition testimony.\nA week later, J&J treasurer Michelle Ryan reached out to Moody’s to get guidance on the impact to J&J’s credit rating.\n“We are looking at a number of ways of capping our talc liability,” Ryan said in a Jul 19 email to Michael Levesque, a senior vice president at the credit-ratings firm focused on pharmaceutical companies. One scenario under consideration, Ryan said, would be to “capture the liability in one subsidiary” and then “basically bankrupt that subsidiary.”\nRyan asked whether the bankruptcy would hurt the company’s credit rating. J&J at the time was one of just two US companies with a triple-A rating, the other being Microsoft.\nLevesque replied that the “technical aspect” of the subsidiary bankruptcy wasn’t likely to cause concern about J&J’s creditworthiness. Rather, he said, Moody’s was “highly likely” to focus on how the subsidiary’s Chapter 11 filing affected J&J’s finances, which the maneuver intended to help.\nRyan did not respond to a request for comment.\nTo execute the plan, J&J created a limited liability company on Oct 11 in Texas through a series of transactions. That company then merged with J&J’s existing consumer products business. The merged company then divided itself under the state’s divisional merger law, creating the subsidiary that would take on all the talc liability.\nThe consumer business could then go on as if the lawsuits had never been filed.\nEarly on the morning of Oct 11, Andrew, the in-house J&J lawyer who initially sent the internal memo to the Project Plato team, sent an email to eight J&J colleagues, including several senior executives. He asked them to approve the Texas two-step bankruptcy plan “as soon as possible” and no later than that day, according to Andrews’ email to his colleagues, which was reviewed by Reuters.\nHe attached a detailed memo outlining the impending bankruptcy’s purported benefits. It would allow, the memo said, the bankruptcy court to determine the final amount of money for resolving all of the litigation, in a process enabling claims to be settled in an “equitable and efficient manner, without the waste and abuses experienced in the state court tort system"".\nThe memo warned of risks. The plan would be consummated under a tight time frame and would be scrutinised by the media. “Appropriate messaging (internally and externally) will be required to avoid or mitigate misunderstandings about the nature of the restructuring and negative publicity,” the memo said.\nAndrew quickly received the green light, within hours of the request, internal emails reviewed by Reuters show.\nLTL, the new subsidiary, held its first board meeting on Oct 14.\nThe board members and lawyers discussed that LTL faced what they viewed as “exorbitant” costs if the current talc litigation barrage continued, which included 12,000 lawsuits alone through the first nine-and-a-half months of 2021, according to meeting minutes and deposition testimony Reuters reviewed. The group noted that J&J faced a total of about US$5 billion in costs from judgments, settlements and legal fees.\nThe board voted to pursue a Chapter 11 filing. J&J disclosed the move in a news release that evening as one that would “equitably” resolve the litigation.\nA plaintiffs’ lawyer grilled Robert Wuesthoff – a J&J manager appointed president of LTL Management – on that point in a Dec 22 deposition.\n“One of the considerations was to treat claimants equitably; it was for their benefit? Is that what you\'re saying?” asked Jeffrey Jonas, a Brown Rudnick lawyer representing a creditors committee comprising talc plaintiffs.\n“Yes, it would be more equitable to the claimant. Yes, we believe that,” Wuesthoff responded.\n“But the real reason we filed for bankruptcy,” the LTL executive said, was that the large and growing amount of talc cases – some with “lottery-size” awards – put J&J’s consumer products business in “financial distress"".\n', 'related_topics': ['     Johnson & Johnson ', '     law ']}"

      Court of Appeal dismisses challenges to Section 377A, law criminalising sex between men to stay
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The Court of Appeal on Monday (Feb 28) upheld a lower court\'s decision to dismiss three challenges to Section 377A of the Penal Code, which criminalises sex between men.\nThe challenges were mounted by: Disc jockey Johnson Ong Ming, retired general practitioner Roy Tan Seng Kee and Bryan Choong Chee Hoong, the former executive director of LGBT non-profit organisation Oogachaga.\nHigh Court judge See Kee Oon had dismissed their challenges in March 2020, and the three men turned to the Apex Court to appeal against the decision.\nAccording to Section 377A of the Penal Code, any man who commits any act of gross indecency with another man in public or in private can be jailed for up to two years. This extends to any man who abets such an act, procures or attempts to procure such an act.\nIn a 152-page written judgment delivered by Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon on behalf of a five-judge panel, the Court of Appeal stressed that the appeals are ""not about whether Section 377A should be retained or repealed"", as this was ""a matter beyond our remit"".\n""Nor are they about the moral worth of homosexual individuals,"" said the Chief Justice. He quoted Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong\'s words that homosexual individuals are ""part of our society"" and ""our kith and kin"".\xa0\nThe appeals are also ""not about the fundamental nature of sexual orientation (whether immutable or not)"", this being an ""extra-legal question well beyond the purview of the courts"", he said.\nThe appeals are instead about whether Section 377A is inconsistent with the Constitution, but even this is a ""deceptively easy answer"" that ""belies the underlying complexity of the issues that are before us"", said the Chief Justice.\nThe Court of Appeal held that the entirety of Section 377A is ""unenforceable"" unless and until the Attorney-General of the day provides clear notice that he, in his capacity as the public prosecutor, intends to reassert his right to enforce the law by way of prosecution and will no longer abide by representations made by the then-AG in 2018 as to the prosecutorial policy that applies to certain conduct.\nChief Justice Menon said it is therefore ""unnecessary"" for the Court of Appeal to address the constitutional questions raised by the appellants.\n""They do not face any real and credible threat of prosecution under Section 377A at this time and therefore do not have standing to pursue their constitutional challenges to that provision,"" said the Chief Justice.\nThe judgment released on Monday laid out a summary of the ""political reality"" surrounding Section 377A in three main points.\n""First, although Section 377A was retained in our statute books, this was on the terms that it would not be proactively enforced,"" said the Chief Justice.\n""The Government\'s evident unwillingness to repeal Section 377A signals its assessment that society has yet to adequately integrate the opposing views of mainstream conservatives and the homosexual community, as well as its awareness that our multi-racial, multi-lingual and multi-religious community remains vulnerable along such fault lines. The Government was especially cognisant that forcing the issue would polarise those who are \'presently willing to live and let live\'.""\nSecond, the retention of Section 377A in 2007 ""was directed at addressing a deeply divisive socio-political issue in a pragmatic way"", the court said.\nThe decision not to repeal Section 377A then ""was a legislative one that was informed not by the purpose behind the enactment of the provision some seven decades earlier, but by the Government\'s objective of striking an optimal compromise between competing interests in our society and accommodating differing perspectives on homosexuality"", said Chief Justice Menon.\nThird, the purpose of the ""political compromise"" on Section 377A that was reached in 2007 was to ""strike a careful balance between the opposing interests of various groups"".\n""The retention of Section 377A served to accommodate the views of the more conservative segments of society, while the caveat that Section 377A would not be proactively enforced served to accommodate the interests of homosexual individuals and to allow them to live their lives in as full a space as is presently possible,"" said the Chief Justice.\nOther points that the Court of Appeal made in its judgment include the following:\xa0\nFirst, the right to express one\'s sexual identity, even in private, is not an express constitutional right.\xa0\nSecond, Section 377A is not an ""absurd"" law, and ""many reasonable people do in fact see Section 377A as being morally justified"", as evident from parliamentary debates.\n""Numerous parliamentarians spoke up in favour of retaining Section 377A, often on the ground of safeguarding societal morality and with the recognition that a sizable segment of our society regards homosexual behaviour as unacceptable,"" said Chief Justice Menon.\nThe Apex Court agreed with High Court judge See Kee Oon that Section 377A does not violate Article 9(1) of the Constitution of Singapore, which states that no person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty save in accordance with the law.\nWhile all previous challenges against Section 377A had similarly failed, the trio\'s court actions came after former Chief Justice Chan Sek Keong called for a review of Section 377A, with two former attorneys-general also making public comments on the law.\nMr Ong was represented by Eugene Thuraisingam, Suang Wijaya, Johannes Hadi and Joel Wong, while Mr Tan was represented by lawyer M Ravi.\nMr Choong was represented by Senior Counsel Harpreet Singh Nehal, Jordan Tan, Victor Leong, Remy Choo Zheng Xi, Priscilla Chia and Wong Thai Yong.\nAmong the arguments were submissions based on new historical material including recently declassified documents demonstrating that the introduction of Section 377A in 1938 was to criminalise ""rampant male prostitution"" when Singapore was under British colonial rule.\nOther arguments were based on expert scientific evidence on the nature of sexual orientation, arguing that homosexuals cannot willfully change their orientation and that Section 377A is discriminatory and violates the Constitution.\nState Counsels representing the Attorney-General\'s Chambers had previously argued that Section 377A sends ""a certain moral signal"" by its mere existence and advances a legitimate and reasonable state interest, reflecting an aspect of societal morality, ""regardless of whether and how it is enforced"".\nThey said Section 377A is constitutional and called the issue ""a deeply divisive socio-political"" one that should be decided by the legislature or Parliament instead of the judiciary.\nAGC\'s lawyers reiterated the Government\'s position that the police will not take proactive action to enforce Section 377A.\nIn a statement after the judgment was released,\xa0Pink Dot SG said it was ""profoundly disappointed"" by the court’s decision.\n""The acknowledgement that Section 377A is unenforceable only in the prosecutorial sense is cold comfort. Section 377A’s real impact lies in how it perpetuates discrimination across every aspect of life -\xa0at home, in schools, in the workplace, in our media, and even access to vital services like healthcare,"" it said.\nOne of the appellants, Mr Ong, said he is ""disappointed with the outcome"", but said the ruling ""does not mean the end of the community\'s pursuit for equality"".\n""Although the non-enforcement of Section 377A offers a small step towards the LGBTQ+ community’s freedom from discrimination and oppression, it will take more time before the LGBTQ+ community finds full recognition and acceptance by policymakers and society,"" he said.\n', 'related_topics': ['     court ', '     law ', '     Section 377A ']}"

      Law Society calls for lawyer Samuel Seow to be struck off over 2018 workplace abuse incidents
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The Law Society of Singapore (LawSoc) on Monday (Feb 28) urged the Court of Three Judges to have entertainment lawyer Samuel Seow Theng Beng struck off over his misconduct in 2018, when he physically and verbally abused his employees.\nLawSoc\'s lead counsel Dinesh Dhillon\xa0said Seow\'s behaviour, as a senior lawyer of some 19 years\' standing at the time, ""brings grave dishonour to the bar"".\nHe said Seow not only showed ""no remorse"", he also conducted interviews with the media downplaying the incidents and placed the incidents into the public eye with his only concern being ""his own reputation"".\nThe Court of Three Judges is the highest disciplinary body to deal with lawyers\' misconduct. Monday\'s hearing comprised Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon, Justice Steven Chong and Justice Andrew Phang. They reserved judgment on what sanctions to impose on Seow, and will release the verdict at a later date.\nAll three judges presiding over Monday\'s hearing gave comments frowning upon Seow\'s behaviour, with Justice Phang saying he has ""not seen or heard something like this ever"" during his years as a lawyer.\nSeow, who is also facing pending criminal charges in the State Courts over the same incidents, pleaded guilty to the eight charges brought against him by LawSoc for physically and verbally abusing three of his employees in March and April 2018.\nFootage of the incident at Seow\'s then-law firm in South Bridge Road on Apr 17, 2018, was leaked online and went viral. It showed Seow reprimanding artiste and Beam Artistes events executive Rachel Kang Pei Shan, before forcefully poking her forehead with his finger.\nHe then pushed a file Ms Kang was holding, causing her to stagger back. After this, he began questioning his niece, Brenda Kong Shin Ying, who was working for him at the time, about where another employee was.\nIn the ensuing fracas, he advanced on Ms Kong and pushed her, while another employee tried to restrain him. Seow then broke free and slapped his niece several times on her cheeks and head.\nHe later turned on employee Serene Tan, who intervened to pull him away, and shouted ""you stop it"" while hitting Ms Tan on her arm.\nAn audio recording of Seow\'s assault against Ms Kong was captured on her phone, and a video of the attack was uploaded on YouTube a year after the incident.\nOn Monday, LawSoc\'s lead counsel Mr Dhillon pushed for Seow to be struck off, saying his conduct was ""unacceptable"" regardless of an employee\'s competence.\nSeow screamed at one of the victims and threw files, boxes and a metal stapler at her, even threatening to kill her on one occasion. At the time of the incident, he was a senior member of the bar, and it was not a one-off incident but ""a pattern of unacceptable behaviour over time"", said Mr Dhillon.\nHe called Seow\'s lack of remorse particularly aggravating, pointing to how he downplayed the incident by pointing the finger at the victim and conducting interviews with the media saying that he was slapped first.\xa0\nMr Dhillon urged the court to give no weight to the defence\'s psychiatric evidence, which stated Seow was suffering from adjustment disorder at the time.\nSeow saw the psychiatrist only a year after the incident, and the report provides ""very little assistance"" as it does not explain what adjustment disorder is\xa0and how it contributed to Seow\'s behaviour, said Mr Dhillon.\nOn top of this, the psychiatric report seems to be based on a version of events inconsistent with the facts and video evidence, Mr Dhillon said.\nThe version of events Seow gave to his psychiatrist portrays himself as a victim of conspiracy, something LawSoc completely rejects. Instead, it is the reputation of the profession that has been damaged by Seow\'s wrongdoings, said Mr Dhillon.\nHe said this case is ""extremely egregious"" and warrants a striking off, adding that Seow has repeatedly abused the dominance he exercised over his employees.\nSeow\'s lawyer Eugene Thuraisingam said his client accepts that he has fallen short of the ideals required of the law profession and is ready to accept the necessary consequences.\nHe highlighted that Seow was ""under stress"" at the time and has since taken active steps such as continuing to see his psychiatrist and taking his medication.\nChief Justice Menon stopped Mr Thuraisingam after he repeated the point about stress. He said: ""Speaking for myself, I just want to tell you that that doesn\'t cut ice. Because every solicitor ... is under stress.""\nJustice Chong then questioned Mr Thuraisingam on what he thought the appropriate sanction should be. ""I saw the video. He was out of control,"" said Justice Chong.\nMr Thuraisingam said this was ""just one incident in 19 years"", and asked if a striking out would be justified based on ""this bad patch he went through"".\xa0\nHe said there were no punches thrown, but that Seow was ""trying to slap someone"".\n""It was a lot of drama and a few slaps,"" said the lawyer.\nThe Chief Justice said this narrative did not fit with what Seow did. Justice Phang added that he was not sure what Mr Thuraisingam was saying ""is actually helping or if it\'s emblematic of this lack of remorse"".\nAfter heaving a sigh, he said: ""I\'ve not seen or heard something like this ever, during (the) years I\'ve been a lawyer ... I think ... you\'re trying to justify something that really cannot be justified.""\nAccording to Mr Thuraisingam, Seow is still currently practising as a lawyer.\nSeow pleaded guilty to his criminal charges in 2020, but a Newton hearing is currently under way to settle issues on whether and when Seow had a mental condition. He has yet to be sentenced by the district court.\n', 'related_topics': ['     court ', '     Law Society ', '     law ']}"

      Singapore must guard against foreign interference that tries to weaken trust, confidence in criminal justice system: MHA
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE:\xa0Minister of State for Home Affairs Muhammad\xa0Faishal Ibrahim on Wednesday (Mar 9) warned against foreign interference by other\xa0countries and\xa0non-governmental organisations (NGOs) that\xa0tries to weaken Singaporeans’ trust and confidence in the criminal justice system.\nHe was responding to a parliamentary question by Mr Murali Pillai (PAP-Bukit Batok) about a court\xa0application filed last August by 17 death row prisoners.\nThe application sought declarations that the Attorney-General had acted “arbitrarily”, discriminated against them as “persons of Malay ethnicity” and “exceeded his powers and acted unlawfully”, Dr\xa0Faishal said.\xa0\nThe High Court dismissed their application in December, finding that the allegations were “baseless” and that the application was an “abuse of court process”. The prisoners did not appeal the dismissal of their application.\xa0\nThe prisoners were represented by the lawyer, M Ravi. The Attorney-General’s Chambers had said at the time that it would be seeking personal costs against Mr Cheng Kim Kuan, the lawyer in charge of the case on record, and Mr Ravi, who practises at Mr Cheng’s firm.\xa0\n“\u200b\u200bThe death penalty remains relevant and important in our criminal justice system, as a deterrent against serious crimes, and to keep Singaporeans and Singapore safe and secure. The majority of Singaporeans support the use of the death penalty for serious crimes,” said Dr Faishal. \xa0\n“While other countries and NGOs may not share the same view as us, this is an issue for Singaporeans to decide.\n""In the incident I referred to, we see them trying to mobilise public opinions, using baseless accusations to play up the issue of race, to weaken Singaporeans’ trust and confidence in our criminal justice system. We must be on our guard against such foreign interference.”\nWhen the application was filed, the plaintiffs’ lawyer posted on social media and credited an ""English barrister"" for his assistance with the application, said Dr Faishal.\xa0\nThis English barrister appears to be associated with a London-based NGO, he noted.\xa0\nBefore the case was heard in court, details of the plaintiffs’ affidavit were published online on a Malaysian news portal even before it was adduced as evidence in court, said the Minister of State.\xa0\nThis was a breach of Supreme Court practice directions, he added.\xa0\nThe plaintiffs’ counsel had also furnished the cause papers, including the affidavit, to a group of lawyers from Lawyers for Liberty, a Malaysian human rights NGO, said Dr Faishal.\xa0\n“The affidavit made completely false, but sensational allegations, designed to grab attention. In the normal course, if the matter had gone on, the allegations would have been shown to be false. But they were published before that,” he added.\xa0\n“The whole unseemly series of events; putting up false allegations on affidavit and then leaking it overseas, seems to have been an attempt to weaken public trust in the criminal justice system, stir feelings in our multi-racial society by using foreigners.”\xa0\nThis is “not the only time” Lawyers for Liberty has tried to intervene in Singapore’s criminal justice process, said Dr Faishal.\xa0\nIn February, two other people awaiting capital punishment applied for leave to review their concluded appeals to set aside their death sentences.\xa0\nLawyers for Liberty “attempted to participate” as one of the applicants, despite not being a party to earlier appeals, he noted. The court dismissed this attempt as well.\xa0\n“We need to build a broader awareness amongst Singaporeans to such foreign interference,” said Dr Faishal.\n', 'related_topics': ['     parliament ', '     Singapore Parliament ', '     court ', '     law ']}"
